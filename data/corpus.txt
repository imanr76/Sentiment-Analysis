Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me
I ordered this dress in a petite but it arrived in a regular  the rest fit and in the meantime the petites ran out in my size.  the dress is too long but it is so beautiful i will get it shortened.  the fabric is lovely.  i am blonde and the green is so nice with my hair... which is a good thing since the other colour was totally sold out.  try not to miss out on this lovely purchase.....
This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.
I just received this in the mail today and haven't taken it off since! i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it. can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it. can not wait to wear it for the holidays!
Purchased in the light grey and was so excited  i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!
This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because  despite how much i liked the style  it just wasn't flattering on my body type.
I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
I love retailer clothes  but i've often ordered shirts in an xs that i really needed an xs petite in because of the length and fit through the bust  but they didn't have any petites in the size i needed. i'm at 5'1"  114 pounds. i got this shirt in xs (not petite) and am thrilled with the fit. the material is formfitting enough to look like a petite  and it doesn't drop below my waist line. i'm thrilled with my purchase!
Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only 3 stars. i love it  as i do all coth & stone pieces. and it is cloth & stonw as another reviewer pointed out. the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight. this dress does not run large as do some c&s pieces so don't size down. i'm 5'7"  126 lbs and slender  and the m is perfect. if you have large or very muscular arms  this dress might not work for you. i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath  tights and boots
Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .
I found it hard to pair with bottoms. fit wasn't very flattering for me.
I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).
This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it'll be retailer. but now i
Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.
This top is so soft i want to wear it every day. the orange is beautiful in person. great fall color. perfect amount of swing.
I thought this dress was beautiful  but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride  i would have kept it  but....
Fit is perfect. body slimming. i'm glad i purchased it.
Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s.     super flattering fit  not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!    for reference i'm 5'6" 103lbs 34a 25 in jeans and i tried on an xs. last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa
Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested  you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe.
Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft  cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.
I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting  flattering and perfect for the season. love them.    the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy  and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend.     they have a bit of str
I love hte green color  it is so vribant. i tried it on in regualr size  thinking i could order petite  but they sold out... waht a bummer.  fit is very flattering  and i find it comfortable.
I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
Great chinos  but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size  i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!
Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7"/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large  it did wash up well though  no pilling.
Love the color of this- a rich  dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy  not fitted. i ordered a small  then thought i should have ordered an xs - so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small  but because this is not fitted  the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.
I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare  kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.
The blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater. the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size. unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering. i really wanted to love this sweater  but just can't figure out how to wear it without poofing. i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots. it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some.
This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.
I love this sweater. my only worry is that i'll constantly be catching the little loops on things and getting it all messed up. i haven't been able to wear it out yet  so we'll see! i'll just have to be careful :)
This is a beautiful dress  just not for me though. since i'm 5'10" it hit me 2-3" over my knees. the colors are vibrant- would look good on most!
Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy  i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem  which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip
I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
This tunic only barely resembles the photo in person.  first  the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos  second  it's huge. i'm 5'4" and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies' shirts/dresses. i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be. it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless; and the style doesn't really lend itself to use with a belt.
I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.
I have this in both the black and red. great design. very flattering and soft. the red is the perfect color. will get a lot of west from these for many years.
I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out  i was curious about it  but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however  i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy  but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again  i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
I like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath. it can be worn in many seasons. i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan. cute dress!
This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely  is a gorgeous color  feels soft  and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand  but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!
I thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that  the dress is as it appears.
The moment i saw this dress  i knew i had to have it. the plaid is beautiful with tones of red  blue and periwinkle. the photos on the website are very true. the unexpected pockets make it even cuter. i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look. i an 5'5" and usually wear a 4 or 6. i got the small and then wondered if it were too big. i ended up going back and trying on the extra small  but it turns out the small was correct. it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f
I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co
I can't stop rubbing the faux fur. faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful. it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top  above my bust. its roomy so size down if you want it fitted. i'm 5'1" and 120 with a 34 c bust and a short torso and i got a small. i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight. the hood is the best part. it's so drama
I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
This skirt is a rare find. slimming  flowing  and best of all  it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips  while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial  yet soft  so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose  better in person that the picture here  and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to
I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful!
I love this dress! it's super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn't bind anywhere--yet somehow it's still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also  it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots  tights  a long-sleeved black t-shirt  etc.).
Beautiful top  i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.
These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by "by design".
This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for "ironic"  it would be difficult to
This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy  feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs  it's long on me at 5'4" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h
Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and it's so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!
This dress is lovely fabric  generaly nicely tailored  but weirdly large around armholes  which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.   dress was generally a a bit too big on top  oddly both too long in the torso  and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12  fairly busty but not extremely  and with a slightly short torso  which is party the problem (th
I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.
I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also  runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.
I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it's still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess. unfortunately  that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.
I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.    first  it is way too short for me  especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay  to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also  the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th
I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.
While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
Sweater fits great and is nice and soft. i am 5'11 and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me
So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle  bressay  this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model  but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color  the warmth  the neckline  and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats
I love this jumpsuit. it's fun  flirty  and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events  and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you  this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings  or down with slip-ons and a cardigan  i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly  doesn't wrinkle too much during wear  and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.
The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
Love love! beautiful  soft  great color! very comfortable!
I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.
I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island. it was comfortable and appropriate. i received so many compliments from strangers. wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too!
Cute print on both sides  but far more "cheek" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.
This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms  or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms  this top may not be for you.
I typically wear a medium  but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width  but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back  but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit  but i think that is the design of the top. overall  i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should
I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back
I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.
This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.
I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect 
What a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2  105lbs  and ordered the xxs petite.
There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that  i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front  while very cute  gave
I needed an outfit for my son's christening 10 weeks after he was born. one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding. this jumpsuit was perfect 'dressed up' with a cropped tuxedo jacket  cute shoes and jewelry. i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new post-baby shape  but was awesome for nursing him when needed. i felt comfortable all day and look forward to 'dressing it down' for less formal occasions. the material is so soft and i
This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small  fitting as it does on the model. it's a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t
I got this planning to wear to a wedding  but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said  it is long  but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!
I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however  it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed  as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one  maybe two sizes.
This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy. it does run a little big. i have to fold the sleeves twice! but it looks great and i got compliments immediately.
Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned  it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra  i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry  but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow
This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality  and they've always said i could bring it back)
This sweater is adorable and comfortable  but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately  i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.
Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft  cozy  and warm  as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl  but the size small was the best fit. for reference  i'm 5'6"  135 lbs  and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i
Like other reviewers  found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
I really liked this dress. the tie defines the waist  and the skirt volume is flattering. one minor concern i had was the dress is a bit thin  although the skirt is lined. i think this will be a great summer in fall transition piece.
I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7"  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it.
Very pretty as shown  runs true to size  however fabric is scratchy on skin.
I ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it. i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly. i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model - i wish i would have listened. while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches  it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through. i didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy. this top does show many of
The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also  the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
I love this top. lovely  light  airy material  though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
I was looking for a cute going out top that was age-appropriate (40yo). i read other reviews that it ran large so i got xxs regular (xs not available) for reference  i am 5'2" and 95 pounds but semi-broad in the shoulders.    i was wary of the poly fabric but it is surprisngly nice and drapes well- easy care for sure. doesn't look cheap at all. when worn on the shoulders  the elastic is tightish  but maybe i could have gone to xs if they had it but at least i know the xxs won't fall/slide.     i
Side slit goes up far when seated so beware  wear on a non bloated day ;) but very comfy and unforced sexified wore it with a fluffy sweater  lots of looks
I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft  comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!
In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7"  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this.
This shirt feels so special. it is mainly t shirt material so i will be dry cleaning to make sure it keeps it's shape and delicate feel. the stitching is so beautiful! i'll wear this with jeans and even my navy pencil skirt for work. so cute!
This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller
Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front  but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft  but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look  but sadly this is going back.
Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.
So  this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made  flowey. very comfortable  until you have to take it off.  this is the review i posted on facebook.   so  no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror  or maybe has not shared with me  that moment when you cannot get out of  because it has turned into a straight jacket  that otherwise cute romper. and again  maybe a man invented it!
Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts  36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however  i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn)  2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look  and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me  it wasn
I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man
I love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn't seem to have helped.
I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes  the length (at the knee  5'5") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall  i love it!
This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
It first really run small exactly  rather if you size up one  the zipper works a lot better. it's beautiful in person! i normally wear a 2 or 4 but i tried a 4 and 6. i bought the size 6. for reference in 5'10 130 lbs
This shirt arrived today  and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary  and if i order it again  it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size  xs petite. i'm 5-2"  so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store  i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!
This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility  it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt   you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it.
The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide  but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops  but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium  my normal size.
This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality  and it has pockets. i am about 5'5"  and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it  but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26" and my hips are 35").
I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.
Dear retailer & designers:  just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please- enough of the polyester!   love   your customers
This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips. it fits very close through the behind --but is stretchy. as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely  i thought it would never work - but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings. and the stretch allows plenty of movement. if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top. so i will just wear it with spanx. th
Beautiful fall colors  perfect with work pants or jeans. i'm tall and was a little worried it would be too short  but it was a good fit.
Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
This top is gorgeous in person  but when i tried it on  i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately  but the more i wore it around the fitting room area  the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8"  140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes  it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.
I'm 5'0  125 lbs  and 34d  i ordered a 6p and it fits perfectly. the color is more of a bronze mixed with gold and chocolate. the picture does not do it justice.
I absolutely love this dress. it's flattering and feminine. you will love it. it runs large so size down.
These are true to size and photo. i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer!
Intrepid soul that i am  i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle  then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes  shook it out  hung it up  and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes  the swing is vast  but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun  something i will use for years  wonderfully comfort
I have about 3 or 4 akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern  button detail and fabric are all very nice.
I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo  but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly  but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan  and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft  of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line
I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!
I bought this dress for work and receive tons of compliments when i wear it! the material is soft and breathable  which makes it comfortable to wear all day at work with a light jacket. i do agree with the other reviewer though  it does show every bump  especially in the tummy. i also noticed that some of the fabric flaps will flip up when i sit down  but i am going to sew the flap down so it stops doing that.
I was nervous about buying this without trying it on  but i followed the size chart and wasn't disappointed! it's flattering thanks to the fitted upper-half and the forgiving peplum bottom-half. overall  it's thin  light  and airy.
I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer  i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!
The outer layer runs large up top; also  the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back  but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.
Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great  the tie dye is very unique love it!
Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally  i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
I tried this dress in my usual size 4. the slip underneath was a big snug but the dress was fine. i sort of looked like a little girl in this dress. it is very pretty but more for the younger girls~not for the over 50 group.
This looked like such a cute  casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said  it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on  i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
Loved the material  but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5" and there was atleast 5" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.
This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.
Cool  comfortable  goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available  but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty  and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black  darker than pictured online  imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had  because it is such a great piece  but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10" 145 p
This material of this shirt is soft and appealing. great for fall. the side slits are longer than they appear in the picture so wearing it both tucked and untucked requires a layering shirt underneath.
I have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports  but doesn't look matronly. this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece  but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful. i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good and/or support a 34ff  but gave it try because of all the 5 star reviews. i tried it on and my husband just said "wow!" this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports - i don't know how  but it doe
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.
So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms
I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.
I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a "draft." they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.
Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3"  ordered a s)  this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back.
So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!
I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
The shirts fits well. it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that it's not see through. the collar is the best part. i wear small and i'm 5'3.
Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
Cute sweater  i really like the grey color. unfortunately  it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping  but even with a t-shirt underneath  i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back.
I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly  it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer  colors are brighter/better in person.
If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.
Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.
Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily  these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please   cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer  you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store  then you are on your own!
This dress does run large  but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is  and is nicely flowy  but might require a slip.
These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through  even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.
I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6" 145 lbs  athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great  just like glove  it does not make me look fat. the quality is great sweater is warm  cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral  it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw
This is the cutest cardigan. i purchased it in the red. i wish there were more colors
I'm in love with this skirt! i already have so many outfits planned out! i do feel it runs slight large  maybe half a size?? i'm 5'6"  135 lbs  and usually wear a 6. i ordered a small  and it's fairly loose  but i like that personally. if you want a tighter pencil look  then size down.
Really interesting  beautiful colors. i found it to be short  even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer  but i could see it working with jeans  or being stunning with a black ball skirt.
Soft and cozy  the orange is vibrant  the green is more subtle and has gray tones. usually wear a small  bought the xxs ! too full and too sloppy in the xs ad small.
I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.
Love the fit and color  but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!
I love everything about this dress. the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement. i got this in a 0p after reading review  and am usually a 00p-0p. the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable. i agree with other reviews that the top is larger. my measurements are 31-24-34...and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and
I really like this shirt. the design and colors are very good. i ordered the black one with cats  it was cool. however  in general i don't like high-low tops because they don't look flattering and you can see that it is asymmetrical from the front  makes it awkward. the shirt's design doesn't make the high-low aspect stand out much which is great. but it is a tad shorter than i would like in the front. it is also loose fitting. it is perfect for a slimmer frame  but on my curvy figure it just wa
I love the colors of the teal dress  but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best.
While i love the design  this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings  but not overwhelming in my 5'3" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it  but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!
This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..
Nice fabric  very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
I love this sweater. it is a beautiful color and i love the boxy shape. very soft.
The double seams down the front of this elongate; the material is light and would work spring through summer  kind shape. even though the dress hits below the knee  the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly. here's the but:  the rib cage area is very fitted. i'm a 6-8  in pretty good shape  and that is not a "problem area" for me. however  in this dress  it was. there was no way for my figure to pull it off. from behind  in both 6 and 8  every bundle of skin seemed ample. i
I'm 5 ' 5" and 132 lbs.  34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin  long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned  it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual  very versatile  perfect for a hot day summer dress!
Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. i have not seen anyone complain about this  but on me  the mock neck collapses in and looks messy. unfortunately i returned both. i sew  and i do not understand why this happened.
I absolutely loved the print on this shirt  and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it. the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person. unfortunately  the shirt is very thin ? much thinner than i'd expect with velvet ? and is so short that it is more like a crop top. even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look  the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel. for reference  i'm only 5'1. i would buy this over again if it were only l
I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of "hangs". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!
This dress is beautiful. it is not meant to be super form fitting so in my opinion it was true to size altho i could see how others may want it to be more so in which case  size down. it came wrinkled but they make it in petite so they are forgiven and the material is such that i'm not sure how it could be prevented.
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.
I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!
I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer  but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy  honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the "red" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots  booties  heels  clogs  flats  sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7"  140 lbs and tried the medium.
The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.
Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky  which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.
The sleeves are fitted which i love. works with a belt or without.
I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur
I loved this trench on the web site  i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2" 135 lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks  tags intact  continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre
I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.
This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans!! soft  sexy (without being skintight) and the perfect color of blue!! i am 5'3"/108 lbs and the 25 was a perfect fit!! these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing (think legs that look a mile long!!) with booties one night and nude heels the next!
Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too "mom" like.
I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.
Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress  i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this "dress". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said "are you kidding me?!"  by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i don't know which dress the
I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft  washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium  but in this brand i am a extra small or small.
I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though  so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants  but wanted to let you kno
Wore this dress recently on a work trip. traveled very well  cut and fabric are super flattering
I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
The print and fabric are great  but this dress has odd construction  or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway  i'm 5-5  weigh 125-130  36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo  but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped  but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress  i think a medium would make the top too big  so i
First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.
Bought this in the white. i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps. i typically vacillate between a m and l  and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large  which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long. ---------- the fabric is soft  and the weight of this shirt is season-less; always a plus. it is not sheer by any means  but if you have a tattoo (like i do) you will be able to see it. --------- quality is
I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available  so can't compare there.    color: i liked the black better for these reasons:  1) color can be worn year-round  just add a nice jacket or cardigan  and ok for winter season.  2) ivory was kind of see-through    size: xxs fit me better  the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.    sadly  the xxs was the ivory  so i didn't keep either of them.    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in wasit
This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering  but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though  the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8"  135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink. the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso  so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s)  it covered my flat hips  fits just like the picture  but now my hips are showing :( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
The model in this photo should be standing tall  because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small  and am 130pounds 5'5"- the dress fits like a glove  and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel  yet nice breezy  sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work  on a hot date  and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf
This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however  the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however  the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short  but have a little wider shoulders  so  perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down  so  i had to do some cont
True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment  or spot clean at best.
I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them  the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy  on the other hand  was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no  it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28  hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or
This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.
This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person  but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today  i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.
I got the purple and its a lovely muted purple  almost lavender. nice quality  flattering. i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits. i'd recommend to anyone (with or without wobbly bits).
Awesome fabric  wonderfully flattering cut. love the blue and green colors.
This is simply the most lovely  interesting  flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!
Love this top. ..especially the back. the back makes the whole top.
Beautiful dress appears well-made  but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see  is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience  which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer  which is what i ordered  so
Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.
This is a good skirt  although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well  has a good shape  and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok  and i'll keep it  but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work  but probably not to nicer events.
This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering  it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light  flowy  and comfortable  but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual  but still unique and beautiful  please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!
I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also  the fit is loose  maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.
Just got this in the mail today. very pretty  soft and comfortable. i could probably have sized down  but it fits fine. for reference  i'm 5'4"  138 lbs and i got an xs. grab this while it's on sale!
When i read car coat  i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin  long blazer. also  the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe  so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected  so it will be a return.
I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.
I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit  very thick  rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky  the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2"  34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long  way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size  may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
Loved this pilcro denim jacket. slight stretch  well-constructed white denim with yellow-gold stitching. it is short and very nice fitting-versatile! runs tts. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and small fit perfectly. i really like it and am not put off at all with thread color. actually gives it some character. mine did have a pen mark on the back but as usual retailer's great customer service provided a solution.
I adore this dress  the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it  but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe  so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress
I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest  but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape  it'd be worth it  but it's going back.
I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!
I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly  they will be going back.
It is gorgeous  and yes  the side slits are very high  but i am still keeping and rocking it. i am a size 10-12 and got the large  probably could have got the medium  but after a few washings  i think the larger size will be ok. side slits high  but if the weather is good  and you have self tanner on legs  it looks great with shortie boots. i have gotten many cmpliments on it  just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear. very pretty in cream  though  i do recommend it. i am 5'8 
I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on  i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss.   people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.
I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.
I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a
I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.
I was really hoping to like this  but it did not look the way it does on the model  at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors
According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10  but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage  the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12  but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit  the ddd would have fit fine  i think.
This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight  but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep  but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.
Ordered this in white  thought would be really cute. but didn't like  and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped.
Very cute  very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d  and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.
Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!
I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort  quality  and design. it is a little short  but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes  but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o
Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!
Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas  my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top  but the way it cuts  you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me  but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
Cute  but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that  returning.
I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would
Found this dress at my local retailer. . it was one of those dresses that just catches your eye.. very very  beautiful print. . the dress is loose and flowy and feels so comfortable on. i purchased it without a second thought. i am 5'1" and usually wear a 0 or 2 and the 2 was a better fit for me. so breezy and cool for summer.
The snake and the studs  they make the dress. sadly  the snake is hard to find  as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large  i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small  fitted look  and the other two show a full  swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
This is a lovely dress  but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress  and i didn't need another casual dress  so i sent it back  but it would be fine if you want something casual.
I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however  i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least  so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2)  the regular length doesn't fall right  the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite.
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
Could not resist the fit and detail on this piece - couldn't wait for it to go on sale. the material is so soft and comfortable. it's "just" a black sweater - but the neckline and back details make it unique! thought i would need a large but the medium fit fine. 5'7" 147 lbs
I never write reviews
I'm 140 at 5' 8". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium
It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style  but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.
This dress is so unique  and is high quality. it came nicely packaged  and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events  and it fits the bill. i wore it once  and received many compliments. the only issue  is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem  but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great  so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.
Deep purple keeps it fall  flower design keeps it feminine  pockets make it fun! love it and can't wait to wear it.
I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out  but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person  the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work  but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10" and usually wear size l in retailer)
I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.
I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually  i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops  but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.
True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.
I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt  she hated it.  well  i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener  and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt  but a soft casual shirt  and as i said before  i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it  even straight out of the dryer.  (i own the yellow and pink!)
I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.
Not long ago  i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love  so when i saw these  i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable  and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise  i find that i have to size down with hei hei  perhaps because they have a looser cut.
Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
My mom pointed out this dress in the store a while back and i said "cute  but no way i could pull that off. "i am a short curvy and busty lady and have never been able to wear strapless dresses. i ended up ordering it for a wedding and it was a perfect fit!!! i got the petite small and the fit up top is snug but comfortable and holds the ladies in with no bra needed. amazing. the fabric is dreamy and this dress is so easily dressed up or down. hides flaws  excellent all around.
As another reviewer noted  the upper portion (back  chest  shoulders  etc.) fit nicely. however  the body of the dress was enormous and did  indeed  make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!
Great layering top! love the color- grey striped  matches almost anything. the sizing is perfect and the material is nice and think but not so chunky that it adds pounds to your frame. interesting detail with the snap neck looks sporty and jeeps it from being just another basic turtleneck.
This is my 4th byron lars dress and i just love this designer. his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell. i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning!
This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!
I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet
I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
I loved this jacket the minute i saw it. saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands. even cuter on than the photo. short back at natural waist long in front . great quality fabric. thick and warm. fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath. the medium is perfect. back is stylish  solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front. sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edge.overall very interesting grey black c
This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off  i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me  it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady  the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty  this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty
The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light  but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!
I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable  and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly  it had two things going against it:  - when i didn't tuck it in  it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest  and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)  - the material is awfully thin  and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a "casual" top)  i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale
I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.
I got this 25% off before christmas. i immediately started wearing it  thinking it would be a staple. i like the swing shape; the shape feels just right - not too baggy. but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals  collects lint like crazy  and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times. also  there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area (as you can see in retailer's picture). it looks out of place in person. i'm left loving the s
I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
I love this dress. be warned that even at 5'4" it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing. i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event  dinner  or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top. it has a quiet appeal. both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it. it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable. i think some reviewers int
I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.
I thought these would be nice  and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also  the jewels make the jeans feel heavier.   fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans  slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer  as not only am i short  but i have short legs for my shortness!)    so if you want that styl
I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
Was really looking forward to this sweater  but it's not a cardigan  it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made  and extremely soft  but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as "batwings." that should have been depicted in one of the photos.
This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!
I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer  but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.
I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd  5'3"  curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!
I love these shirts. ordered in 2 colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves. so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long!! the fabric is fabulous and a great weight. one of my favorites for sure.
I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown  rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested  it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.
The dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
After reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust  and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis  so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference  i'm 5'6"  a straight build 134 lbs  and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.
I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy  perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area "winter"  but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt.
This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!
I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton  making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6  i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area  making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a
Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la
This is a great sweater/poncho. is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath. great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans.
The pictures of this blouse simply don't do it justice. the floral details are gorgeous. i liked it when i ordered it  but loved it on. i am 5'5"  135lbs  curvy/athletic frame  ordered the size 4 and it fit perfectly.
Like the other reviewers  i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body  so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets
I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.
I loved the dog on this sweater  and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on  like others  i did find it to be itchy  but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are  so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!
I like this top  but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1"  and have a larger bust  34 c. this shirt fits in the length  but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts  and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color  and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage  my bras are not covered by this to
I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no  it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!
The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least 2 sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $24 :).
Runs very big.  i ordered a l and need a m.  unfortunately no medium left!  great top with lots of character. hate i missed this cute top
The reason i gave this an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the sizing. the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option; otherwise  i would give this 5 stars. this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors. i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered; it is way too big on me. i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered.     i loved this jumpsuit so much
Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.
Love the unique look of this coat. living in the northeast  during cold weather i wanted something warm that wasn't your run-of-the-mill wool coat. i agree with the other reviews about the somewhat "bulky" nature of the coat  but i'm not wearing a coat of this nature to look thin. i'm fairly thin  5'4" 102  i know i'm not bulky  so i didn't care if the coat made me "look heavier" than i am  it's a winter coat  get over yourself  no one really cares how much you weigh. so  if you can get past tha
This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright  colorful  quality jacquard  classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(
I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.
This has a wonderful texture and feel to it. the leather dots are supple  and the tulle is soft and flowey. it's long  more like a midi skirt  and the color is more towards taupe than ivory. with a shimmer  this skirt is very fun to wear.
This cardigan is very soft and feminine. it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere. i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room. if you don't mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater.
I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however  when i received it  its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally  i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2  30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted  but its definitely not.
I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model  but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
I am a proportionate 5'4" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p  which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big  but not bad. the top part  however  was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide  the lace sleeves were way too big  there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate)  etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol
I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses  but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while  and it finally went on sale  then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas  and if fit like a glove. for reference  i?m 36 bust  30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being "sexy/conservative". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching.
I have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo. it runs small and the size 10 fits like a size 8 would fit . 145 lbs and curvy figure  flat tummy but have hips and tush. the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable. i love a-line styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces. it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp . website pho
I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.
I bought these pants in yellow for an event where i had to wear yellow. i was weary about the color but it is so great in person. it's a very bright lemon-y yellow. they're high waisted and very flattering. i'm 5'11" and normally wear a 30 and they were a little too large but nothing a tight belt couldn't fix. they also hit a little bit above the ankle which initially i was worried about with the flare but it actually was a really cool look. i received so many compliments that day and am glad to
Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain  not as displayed.
I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad  so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.
I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.
This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front  and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
Beautiful detail  soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length.
I should preface this by saying that i'm in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i'm keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style  but i wouldn't be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds!
The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere
This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal)  but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.
I love this suit! the fit is incredible.     i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time  but i got it on sale  and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!
This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.
Two strikes against this top  and its going back. first  the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact  since i have tanks i could have worn  but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price  i wouldn't have expected b
I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!
This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!
This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
I love the black and pale pink of this dress  the contrasting fabrics and the embroidery. my favorite kind of dress  creative and a little edgy  but elegant and can be dressed for the office too. ordered a size up from my usual size because i tried the previous dress in this style and it was a bit snug. the size up was a good decision  fits in the shoulders and waist better. the fabrics are nice and the finishing on the dress is well done. the mesh in the bodice is a little delicate and i will h
I tried this top because i loved the not so simple  simpleness of it. however  it was a miss for me. loved the fit and style  which i'd say is pretty true to size  i just didn't love the color on me. i went for the orange one and the color was a bit too bright for my liking. cute top though! for reference i'm a usually small  i'm 5'4" and a small fit perfectly.
I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look  it's super cute.
Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!
The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality  but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape.
This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however  if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique.
This dress is really cute in person. however  it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot  but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa
The material of the lace is nice and soft  it is not a stiff lace. i am 5'6" 36dd 146lbs and ordered the small. it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes. i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do. i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white  it is not. it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect. i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also. this will
This product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey. props on the draping though  that was lovely.
First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7"
I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors.
I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also  i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!
I love this shirt so i bought both colors. i wish they had more colors! fits great and very comfy.
This vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot. it is soft  warm  and drapes beautifully...perfect length on my 5'7" frame. the leather detail along the edge is a nice high-quality touch. i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck  but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue. the dark color is navy in the print (not black)...overall i think this is gorgeous  but the full price feels a little ludicrous...i think i may wait until sa
Such a cute plaid print  i couldn't resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out. i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge. i ended up returning it. i think the xs petite may have worked but it's sold out so i'll never know. it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not. the colors are magnificent.
Love the pleating on this top. looks great with my  white jeans. it's lightweight and has a slight sheerness.
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.
I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
Like it; but it's quite short and rather boxy. i'll keep it because it's pretty versatile.
This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl  in some cases l. i tried l  it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams  so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty  it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea
Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.
I love this sweater!!! i checked runs large  but it's really just a roomy sweater. i bought the small  which is what i usually buy  but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts  etc. it's soft and cozy and i think i wore it 3 days straight when i first got it - one of those pieces that you will wear over and over. wore it with jeans and a blouse  then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest! love this sweater!!
This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it  the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.
I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0  usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light  definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying  but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!
I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly. fits tts (5'8"  160lb - sz 8) and is really flattering. it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w/ the right bra. purchased it on sale and am so pleased!
Love  love  love this little lbd!  lots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back. dress up or dress down.  i will be wearing this into the fall season. i purchased the l  still roomy  tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest. i am usually a size 12  d cup. very flattering style boho chic.
So.. i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love. utter i-have-to-have-it love. before dropping $200 superfast  i gave myself some time to think it over. well  of course i decided to order it  and of course my size was sold out. most of the sizes were sold out  actually. they did have a petite left  so after i dried my eyes  i decided to wing it. the petite actually fit. the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with (although the top is so structured that it ac
I love this top. in fact  when i saw in the store  i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.
Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.
I wanted to roder hte petite version  as it runs long  but they are out of the ivory. i put hte green-ish color in my basket  and may order it  but for now  i am hlding off as i have other nice seaters... so many choices.  long  warm  fun closure  falttering  and nice tie back detail.
This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.
I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.
I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length  which does not work with my mama belly.
Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
This looks cute in the web photo  unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.
I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!
Classic tank with the perfect fit!  soft aqua perfect for summer.  fit is very true to size!
I absolutely love everything about this top! i got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all  but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit
This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately  it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it  but i'm sending it back.
These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short  i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight  i probable should have ordered then one size up!
I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however  it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool  cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th
Love this sweater. comfy and trendy. can't wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings!
I just bought this tee in red. i have worn it and washed it once. i noticed that there is a hole already by the top of the pocket. considering the price  i would hope that it lasts for more than one season.
I always wear a small in retailer tops and this was very tight in the chest. had to return for a medium. cute top otherwise!
I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose  body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.
This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go. :-(
This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.
I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing  lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage  and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it  but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.
This may be one of the cutest items that i have every owned! runs big  i am a 4 and the 0 fits perfectly.
Beautiful lightweight and well tailored   more dressy than what it appears in photo
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...
I really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.
This top is so pretty  even better in person. it's made really well and i love that it's washable. i did have some initial reservations with the fit. i'm petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra 'help'. but with the way this top is cut  swingy and slightly bell shaped  i found that wearing a bra  even one with light foam cups (not even pushup)  was making the shape of the top look really weird. once i took off the bra  the top actually looked great. i got
Disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.
I am very pleased with this skirt! you can tell it is very well made and is just beautiful! very true to size!
This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.
This blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back. it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in. it's unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey.
All i really need to say is this is the perfect layering piece. i love that you have a choice in the neckline that you want to wear. form flattering and is true to size.
I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top  faded  ripped  rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.
I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality  soft  great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code  so for me  that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try
Gorgeous design  but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric  although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning
I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail  but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso  and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4")!  curvy ladies  also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely  the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not  and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would
I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.
These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants  but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them  size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
Love the deep purple color of this cardi sweater - long and drapey looks great with leggings skinnies and jeans. my only problem is the way the loose stitching around the cuffs is makes it worrisome. wore once and already starting to get a hole. still a great piece.
I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.
Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.
I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.
Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
I ordered this pullover in green  size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however  it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.
I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.
I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses  with jeans or skirts all year round!
As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
I love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it  but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.
Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!
I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad  i would have bought it for sure.
I ordered this in a regular medium even though i am short i never order petite pants as the crotch is always too short...but this crotch is very long.....i have exchanged for a medium petite and hopefully that will work. i have last years short denim romper by the same brand and did not run into this issue.
These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.
I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric  and for a white/lightly striped dress  not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry  holes started appearing everywhere  both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest  in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget
So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color  but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.
Great sweater  beautiful detail  warm and cozy. i will wear this well into spring because it's a nice weight for cool spring evenings. the knit pattern is beautiful and will be great for casual wear and dressy occasions as well.
I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping  and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl
I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.
This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size  perfect drape  lined & not clingy  just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can!     only "con" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes  but maybe they make it in petite...?
I saw this in that postcard "catalog" and it drew my attention immediately  so when i saw it at the store  i knew i would try it on.  this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things  the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy  but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7" and it hit me right at the knee  so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring
A wardrobe addition to dress up  or dress down. the sheer sleeves are a nice detail...  (i'm 5'6"  and the length hits me at the knee.)
I wanted to really love this because it's a bit more styled than a plain tank  but the front and back both poof out and i felt like i was wearing a maternity top. just didn't do my body any justice....loved the top and that part fit great  but the bottom part was too poofy and sadly not a good look at all on me.
Love the look! it's a little tight but i still like it.
I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic  but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8  to give you an idea. i would recommend it  but it is going back for me.
This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said  this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo  and i am short at 5' 2". cute top  but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style.
I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is  by far  my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love  love  love this tunic/dress!!
I am a big fan of maeve tops. i love the beading and structure of this top. despite the fullness of the design  the fit is flattering
Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering  the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral  and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering  i originally bought hte xs in the store  but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs  5'1.5" and 30 dd  with 26-27 waist). both fit  but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also  the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried
In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums  i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft  not too stiff or scratchy  and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece  i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter  too. yay!
Love  love  love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric  and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.
I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully  natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )
Very cute top and so comfortable! it runs big i'm between a medium and large. i ordered the large and it's definitely a little big but wearable. i probably should've swapped it for a medium but it's still really cute!
This dress is so flattering  not the usual type of dress i go for  but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down  if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.
I ordered the xs p and xxs p in the black one. i thought this would be a fairly classic piece to wear any season (cold offices in the summer  southern california in the winter). the xxs p was a bit better fitted  not too small  but the xs p was ok too  if you prefer a baggier look  so based on that i call it large as i would usually purchase the xs p not xxsp. (115 lbs  30 dd  26.5in waist  muscular arms)    the material is airy and light  but i am a little worried about wrinkling  we shall see.
I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper  thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere  so i was happy about that. still  it is made with slub
This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green
I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews)  then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured
The stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality
Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00  and  oddly enough  there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy  or is the 00 size just a sham?
Love this jacket! really wish it came in real leather as well but can't beat this price point. great cut  fit. and love that the zipper is black. looks like it is worn in leather  most peoppe can't tell that it's vegan!
This sweater vest is the best! it is so versatile! i've already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day. the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy. i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well! it makes coordinating easy. i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot  but thankfully it's not at all. runs true to size. worth full price!
I love byron lars dresses  and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is  sadly  going back today.
Love this sweater! it is very simple but pretty! it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable.
The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.
These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!
I wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(
I'm 5'4" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel
This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color  too  so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand  order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels "slinky" for lack of a better word. essentially  it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered  so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami  although in the lighter version i c
Love this piece! lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely. wear it alone or with leggings and boots.
The shirt is quite beautiful  the lace is thick and high quality. however  i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person  or one who has a straighter build.
This dress is fantastic. super flattering and unique. i get a compliment every time i wear it. i encourage retailer to source more dresses from this brand/designer. lovely. i am picky and nevery give a perfect rating  this dress got all 5 stars.
Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected  but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up  it might be a little longer in the body  but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick  so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!
This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual  perfect for the office or better yet  afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid  but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said  it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2" and fit
Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small  the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs.
I received many compliments on this dress. for a maeve dress it did run large. i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect. i am 5' 2" and 120 lbs. i have a little belly and this dress hides it well. beautiful colors and nice shape. it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work.
I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.
I ordered this top in all 3 colors  love the peplum.look..  returned the green  which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream   especially going into spring/summer..  kept the yellow and the navy and love..  the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.  it's a very cute top  runs a little large  but is very pretty.
For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.
This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4" 120lbs  about a size 4 in dresses  32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height  it's just a few inches above my ankle  so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length  and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal  there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra  and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric
I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f
I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
I recently purchased this dress and i am very happy with the quality. it is a little bigger than i anticipated  but nothing that can't be fixed with a cute belt! the embroidery detailing is gorgeous.
I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.
This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women  like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small  but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color  great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.
I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great  the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.
I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable  fits well (slightly large to size  but i prefer that)  and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.
I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
My husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift. these leggings  let me tell you about these leggings!! so comfortable  so cute (buttons/color/pattern)  love they way they feel on my legs. as soon as i get home from work i put them on (well  a lot of days). i am ordering another pair. i am someone who doesn't do leggings. i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy  that's how much i love them.
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate  yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured  there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs  which is my typical size in retailer sweaters  as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize  but not bulky.  however  the decorations do add some volume  so maybe not for all body types.
The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price  i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.
I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.
I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers.   obviously  based off the
This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.
I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted it's exactly what i was hoping for. everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect. i highly recommend it!
My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still  a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!
Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!
I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red.
My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online  so that was nice to see consistency. overall though  i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks  which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short  and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving  walking or dancing in this dress  which brings me to the question of
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a t-shirt! the sky blue color is spectacular. the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering! i am tall at 5'8" and it was plenty long enough. i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect. it is cut to follow the lines of the body. i can't wait until the spring so i can wear it! it would be great if it was available in more colors.
I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer  but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine  but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing  but overall  just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material  not denim.
Great shirt  the material is lightweight without being see through. i didn't find the cut to be all that flattering  but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it. definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet.
I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses  this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous  the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
The lace on this looks like it would be stiff  but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.    it's as see through as the photo. and  i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra
I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite  and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes  the button is low  but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise  the fit may be completely off.
I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!
I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top.
This structured sweater is beautiful and timeless! gorgeous seasonal color and style is classic! i typically order medium but wanted a more flowy look and got a large. great purchase. great fit!
These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink  rolled in a towel  and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well  these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!
I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull  mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn  stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
I tried this on in the store  and the fabric is lovely - so  so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric  so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.
As the previous reviewer stated  this wrap is over sized but that is the style. the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely. this is an heirloom piece that will last for many  many years.
This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha
Was excited to try this interesting skirt  as a mega bailey 44 fan. however  this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the "vegan" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so 
Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight  i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely  so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.
I love simple  comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin  the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally  tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so  it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is  the lace
While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips  it does my hips no favors)  but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft  it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats  it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said  the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well  so maybe it's more
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!
Think price convinced me to put this in my bag ... the oops of on line shopping i guess. the strip and 'stitch' like snowflake is just not me. a little too "cutesy' for me. if strip alone might have kept .. but this is just too much  not my style .. back it goes.
I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :)
I bought this in the white  size m (140lbs.  5'8"  34b) because i wanted a baggy fit  which i got  so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white  which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size  this tee nips in at the waist.however  the quality of this tee is lacking  as it is the typical  cheap  marled  slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said  a medium would fit better and would not be so wide  but i fe
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however  the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.
Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!
I'm tall with long legs  long arms  and a small chest  and the medium fits me almost perfectly. i love the long sleeves (sleeve length is always a challenge for me) and how the coat accommodates my broad shoulders. my only problem is that the belt wraps around my lower ribs and looks odd. if i can get the belt loops lowered 1.5-2 inches  it will be perfect. if i can't  i'll return it because the coat looks much better with the belt tied if it's buttoned up. one small point: the coat arrived incr
I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.
Once or twice a year  retailer dons out a true 80s masterpiece!  the sweater is sturdy  bright and bold. quality and craftsmanship are amazing and the fit is tts!  i cannot wait for the cooler weather to wear this beauty with some skinny jeans!!
I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!
Didn't like at all. itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl.
I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it  the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights  but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday  and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink  but from an arm's length away or more  it looks beige wi
Cute  easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so  if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.
These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.
I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long  even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo.
Gorgeous color and fit  but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!!
I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
I had really high hopes for this dress  and i am still unsure if i'll keep it or not. i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand. the small fit (i"m usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b  140 lb  5'8") just like it does on the model  only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress. this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly. also  the colors should be more like "blue multi" because there's a bright a
These fit much better than expected. they are made of a very comfortable lightweight fabric. not very substantial  but they will be great for the summer. i was worried that they would be too roomy in the hip area  but the cut is rather flattering. such a great deal at the sale price.
The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse  and great quality.
The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
I'm 5'8" and a 2/xs and this fit well in size 2  waist was actually a bit loose. unfortunately the waist hit at least 2" too high -- on my ribcage. not cute or flattering. that was the only flaw. would be perfect on someone about 5'6". otherwise the dress looked exactly as pictured. love the boho vibe of this dress  the lace  sleeve length  and cotton material. could easily be dressed up or down. the style feels a little edgy - not too sweet. i am so sad to return this.
Love the color  fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2"  115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!
I was feeling defeated in my search for a dress for some upcoming holiday parties while shopping today. i saw this dress in the dressing room as another customer was trying it on. she was a shorter petite woman and this dress looked amazing on her. it instantly caught my eye and it looked great on her! i went and was lucky enough to find a size 10. lately i've been closer to a 12 sadly and was worried this was going to be another bust. i'm 5/11 and much curvier than the woman i saw in the dressi
I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can. the fish print is adorable! and you can't beat the style and uniqueness for this price. i am 5'6"  145 lbs with long legs and a thicker waist. normally wear size 8 in pants and purchased these in size small. i would definitely recommend sizing down. the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow. can't wait to wear these!!
When i saw this slip/nighty on-line i loved it! most of the night-gowns i own are from retailer and i am very pleased with them. i ordered my normal size small and it fit well. for reference i am 5' 1" and 120lbs  35c. the only slight issue is that the fabric is quite sheer  not a big deal since one is wearing this item to sleep in  but it would have been better in my opinion if it wasn't so see-through. also this may not matter to anyone but the stitching along the top is a bright neon pin
I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it  either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure  (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.
I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small  at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s
Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"  115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.
I bought this as a "reward." i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this. goes with so many things; tons of compliments. soft  comfortable material.
The shorts are very cute  very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1"  115 lbs. they are going back.
I ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them "wine  side zip pants." they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back  even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.
Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.
I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops  but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti
My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look"  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2"  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2")  this a a
One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned  the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before  so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger  but i definitely have neede
I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.
When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.
This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight  not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted  5'7" 125lbs and the small fit.
Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area  waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful  but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs  and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.
I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live
I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.
This is adorable!  lots of compliments on color.  great fit!
I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice  too. however  i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.
Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online  but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!
The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says "mesh" it means "mesh"! i was thinking the "mesh" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.
I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings  with boots  etc.  this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.  the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).  even if i could find a size that worked  there was n
The skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately  the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.
I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places  too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b
My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.
This is one of my favorite pieces. simple  classy  and cozy!
I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray  but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said "you look pretty  mommy." i was sold! i love the cascade on the side.
This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and won't want to take off! i went with the gray wool. i always worry about jackets that are too snug  as i am busty  but this fit is superb. the arms are unusually long (though maybe this is good for you). i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch  so now it's perfect for me. i bought the regular medium  my usual size (size 8 or medium top  34f). i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open  but it's nice to know that i can but
I ordered this item when it was first advertised  fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed  the fabric is cheap  the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
This is a beautiful coat nicely constructed and very warm. it was just too bulky for me and i looked 10 lbs heavier in it. i am 5'7" and 140 lbs. maybe it would be better suited to a more slender frame.
Slighty fitted  flattering  very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color.
This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz  this is it. i have wide hips  and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality  and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!
Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe  but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft  cozy  and cute  though.
I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!
This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it  and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d  130 lbs fit small perfectly.
Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!
This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi
The tank is very structured  thick yet breathable  not see through. the coral is much brighter in person  and the white is more like a light cream color. the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because it's such an unusual color. size regular xs is fitted on me (not too tight  not too loose  but over the course of the day  it stretches a little) and the hem falls at the upper hip (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big. the knit a
Wish i would have bought them in every color. love
Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference  i'm 5'4"  short-waisted with larger athletic thighs  smaller waist  bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i didn't have to cut off several inches in length  though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag  but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the
I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic  the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.
Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!
I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also  didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would "hang" appropriately and "swing" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.
Really liked this dress  but it ran too big for me.
Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut  and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape  and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally  it's an awkward  unflattering length. i'm 5'4" and it hit below my knee.
I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric  but i had a gift card  and it is retailer after all.
Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it
Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
This is a lovely and unique blouse. it can be worn with jeans  shorts or a skirt. such a beautiful addition to anyone's wardrobe!
This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.
The color was very different and vibrant. chose to size up for extra room and length
Great fit  looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.
Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch. can be dressed up or down. i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi. 5'4" 135# and the small is perfect.
I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb  heavy and glossy  good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete
Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer  it is the most fabulous cut  super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless  i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9  142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.
As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes.
A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.
Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages (for warmth and practicality)  but i'm not the sporty type. this is the perfect alternative! i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans. it is a lovely color and passes as wool. this is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. highly recommended. btw  it runs quite big. i'm generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me.
I ordered this online and was so excited to try it! unfortunately it didn't work for me. maybe its the style but i had issues with the fit. maybe i'm too long waisted  it just didn't seem to fall properly. i liked the fabric  loved the length  could see getting a lot of use from this. i would definitely recommend trying it on!
The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.
I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
I love the look of this bra  but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.
Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
Relaxed fit  soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price  i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look  size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos). ---------- overall these are very nice. but there is one is
Bells out to much i had to send it back
This dress is true to size  it looks sexy on the model but much more modest in person. great for work!
Love the fit and feel of these. and super stylish too. i want in more colors if i can get it.
Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected  but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.
This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
This blouse is lovely. i ordered a large because so many blouses run small for me  but am returning for a medium  as it fits pretty loose. i love the tie. its unique and feminine.
This trench is beautiful  with a lovely  swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement - you'll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie. i wish i could have kept it  but i couldn't justify paying full price on a coat that had to be hand-washed (the label specifies no dry cleaning!).there is a lot of fabric on this trench  and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too. i don't have the time for that  and for this much money  i wou
Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha
Okay i'm short  so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty  but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!
Definitely size down  the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.
I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
I loved the look of this dress online  so i was excited to order it  but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy  but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory  but it made the material poof out just under the waist  making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead  which
Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.
I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a "straight down" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a "flare out" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut 
I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives
Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash  but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!
I love the lace up design and bought the red xsp  fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality  but over all happy with purchase. wish this top came in navy and white as well. even a navy/white stripe would be a fun option too. thanks you for offering this top in a petite size. :)
It's a pretty top  but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design  just not sure i will keep it due to length
The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.
When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.
Love this dress! it fits perfectly  is flattering  and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print  and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well  as this is a comfortable  cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7  135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect  even a tad bit loose  but i prefer a bit loose to tight  especially with the design with the buttons up the front.
I saw online  great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool  angora  mohair! 5'1  xsp  tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.
Love my new top! i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants! it's funky style garnered lots of compliments. as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate. it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out!
I bought this top in the wine color. i just love it. as soon as i wore it i received compliments because it has so many unique details. i bought a medium and it was just the right size.
Love another pair of ag stevie's!
Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it  upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places  the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!
This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.
I bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with  so they may sag.  overall  i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren
I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
This cut and fit is so good. i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally  and i was glad i did. it fits just right!
I wanted to love it  but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous  but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.
This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'2 about 105 pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you won't
I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.
This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however  the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.
This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.
This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.
Bought this at sale price. pretty in person and soft / comfortable. runs really big. size down.  i got it in my usual size l  but will have to exchange for an m.
This is a beautiful tunic. the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality. please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print. it is still very pretty. please size down a size. i am usually a large  wearing a 12 or 14 if something runs tight across the bust  i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area. i am not small in this area either.i would recommend buying this tunic.
I wasn't sure about this top when i saw it on line but it is actually nicer than the picture. it is very flattering and the color is perfect for the summer!
This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt  especially in light blue. when it arrived  i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape. price is great with extra 40% off so considering to get dark red one as well now!
This top runs a tad big. it's beautiful in person and sooooo soft. definitely an retailer staple top. material and cut is great
I bough a green  size s (140lbs.  34b  5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and  although it is cut generously  it is cut close to the body. the "green" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however  the knit of the yarn is very chunky  which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover  since i have long arms  the bell sleeves do not reach my wri
This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...
I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam  it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+)  i would foresee this dress being too snug. however  i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops  but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
Great fit! for reference  i am 5'7"  160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!
After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!
I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top  but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves  but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick  which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up  but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.
I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail  the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely  but between the fit and the scratchy fabric  this is headed back. too bad!
For the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent. the style is cute  but nothing more. however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.  the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.  no need to say - it's going back asap.  you should not sel
Love these sateen jeans. they are a bit more polished than regular  flat black jeans  but not too shiny. i am 5'9" and always wear a 27 in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly. the mid-rise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model (hits above my ankles). they're easy to dress up or down  and i have a feeling i'll be getting a lot of use out of them.
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
I really want to love this dress  the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large  but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy  to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also  it has lining which is nice for modesty  but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining  it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k
I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately  this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big  it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump  but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person  which was a happy mishap. the 8p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion  so beware that this borders on too long for petites. my not small chest made me look pregnant  but it fit well regardless. adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length. this is a miracle as-is because i'm very short-waisted. keeper!
I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"
This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.
I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties  flats  wedges  heels  anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering  as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall  great and a good price (at least co
I bought these pants in white and tan. they are comfortable and fit great.however  they tend to stretch. i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose. i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable.
Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be "short waisted"-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model)  which never happens! great quality  thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!
This top is beautifully constructed  fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra  accommodates my larger bust 34dd.
I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.  the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color  i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.
Love this sweater! i almost passed it up on-line because i didn't notice the snails. the sweater is navy and the snails are black. they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent. the material is a moderate to light-weight sweater. the length was perfect. i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year - this one is not cropped - yay!! the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side. i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops. i am typica
Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3" high heels. i am5 '3"  and probably would have been  better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however  busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt  w
Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.
I love these pants! for reference i am 5'1 1/2" and 104lbs. so definitely petite. i ordered the extra small petite- way too long and huge around the hips.- i checked to see if maybe they sent the wrong size. hemming would not have been a problem and i even considered having them altered - but it would have been too difficult with the pockets and the pleats. unfortunately they do not come in xxs p so sadly they are going back. order a size down.
I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast. i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently  but this last year  i have found myself needing the smaller size (vanity sizing?) in this case  the xxs p was perfect for me  length was around mid-thigh (could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs)  the waist and chest are fitted but not snug (fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves). the flower patterns are so cute  it does cut at the p
I have now purchased these pants (online) three times in the ivory. i first ordered them in a 28 as it was the only size available  and i thought that size would fit me in this brand. wrong! i was swimming in them. great pants  but too large in the waist. i kept checking online and they popped back in a 27  which i thought would fit. wrong again! they arrived a couple of days ago  and still they are too large in the waist  but since 27 was the only size available  i thought that i would keep the
Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight  it's back  and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made  can go from business to sport to casual.
I loved this top! the cinched in waist is so flattering. or i'll leave it un-cinched for a super relaxed fit. it's comfortable and light weight so i'll be wearing this into late spring/ early summer. i've worn it with the green pilcro slim pants  i've worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress  i've worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach. i can't wait to find more fun ways to wear it!
I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect.
Very flattering and flowy dress. would pair this dress with cowboy boots or navy wedges.
I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely "sack-like" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return.
I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
Love the asymmetrical zipper  style  fabric and color. so soft  comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!
Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design  lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out.
I like this sweater vest - really nice quality. looks great with ankle lenght jeaens and booties or a shorter skirt as shown on the model. quality is really nice - it's fairly heavy. i love the slits on the slide. i do find it runs a big large.
The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in "real" life. size was not wrong  the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it.
I am so happy with this dress. i bought my usual size 2  and it was a perfect fit. this dress is gorgeous. it has some stretch  which is a plus. i am 5'5 "  and it was not too long on me at all. i am so thrilled with my purchase.
I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.
Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it  however it just did not fit.
Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.
I purchased this piece in store in a size small  ivory. i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect! material is soft  lightweight  and very comfortable. collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look. i'm so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long!!
First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second  i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it  but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the "layered luna dress" in grey  and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference  i ordered my normal size xs (5'5  115 lbs  muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves  but i still think there would be adequate room.
Love this top for work. loose  flattering and enough detail to be noticed. fits tts and goes with everything.
This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out
I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.
Great fabric and nice cut - like other reviewer said  fitted but not too....but it was just too short for my legs. i do wonder if the description is wrong but i didn't keep it long enough to measure and check this.
The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.
I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
Nice dress  you can wash it  i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect    brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material.   material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving.   i will be returning it for that reason  too heavy for summer .
This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite  but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings  with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs  but ordered the s  based on the size chart  it's a perfect fit.
I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.
When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.
I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit  because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami
I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me  which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back  in side two layers  and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.  i'll probably wear them again  but i'm not totally thrilled by them.
This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!
This dress is exactly what i needed.  it's so easily dressed up or down.  heels and jewelry for cocktail this time.
Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.
I just bought these jeans today & i absolutely love them!  i usually wear a 25 or 26 in any jean depending on the fit. i bought these in the 25 regular & they fit so perfect. they definitely are not a legging fit nor are they a baggy boyfriend style. on the tag these jeans are described as a girl fit - slim with a dash of ease. that describes the fit of these perfectly. they are not tight & not baggy at all  just a bit of ease - at least on me. i am 5' 5" & the regular length is perfect. the fab
This tank top is comfortable and very cute. it hides my tummy  as well  which is a bonus! ordered in another color i love it so much
It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.
Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.
Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.
Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
I have worn this dress with a jean jacket  birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal. it washes beautifully and is super soft. would buy in different colors if there were more options. looks better in person.
I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.
As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality  worth the money!
Really cute skirt  but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy  so if you got them  forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt.
This is the most comfortable dress ever! it's so soft. i typically wear a size small and this fits true to size. it is long enough to wear to work  which i love. it looks great w flats in the summer and it's going to look great w boots!
This is a lovely dress - however  there is a weird flap of fabric under the bow that doesn't sit right. it feels a little like a bib. if i could get it to sit right  i would keep it. every angle of the dress is lovely except for head on - which is a small problem.
This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting  but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.
I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.
I am curvy and this top  while stylish and i love the pockets  just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are  which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy  just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere  i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s
I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice  very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch  105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking  but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women  but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.
I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.
I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown
Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd  so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.    the fabric is sheer but not overly so  embroidery is well done. over all a b
I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they don't stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.
Lovely sweater  good quality fabric  pretty color.   as the reviewer say  it is very thick wool pile  if warm is not what you're looking for  you may want to think twice.
Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining  huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!
I really wanted this dress to work out  but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6  however  my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(
I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.
Very charming  well made and comfortable. it is a heavier material with a slip so it's a great spring dress if you have cooler days but i could see in the summer if you have 80f + temps it could be a little warm. i have a 34c/d chest and i didn't find it too snug like the other reviewer. pretty tts for maeve.
This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed. one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters  timeless  affordable  and versatile.  worth the money!
This shirt is cute  nice cut  but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.
Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference  i&#39;m 5&#39;2  115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!
Maybe it's just me  but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7  around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give  but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe. the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model  and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the
They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.
This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull  no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap  shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on  because it was so hideous  when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite
The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately  the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
Best jumpsuit ever! so soft and always gets compliments! get one now before they're gone. also it is supposed to be tied in front! i'm 5'3" and the small petite is just perfect!
I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped  i pounced on the black. sadly  it did nothing for me. i'm a large  sometimes medium  but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price  but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back  uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.
I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
This dress is really beautiful  but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low  i could wear a bra with straps with it  the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.
Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur
I just bought this today so i can't say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it's different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people won't have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.
I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.
I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative  and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes  yet i do not like to look "frumpy." this is cute and chic  yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!
I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets  as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise  it is a great color and shape. still sad though...
Great fit  wonderfully made  and priced just right.
This is a simple design  but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding.  this dress is great for hourglass shapes  but it does not hide your features.
I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.
I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.
Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"  135 lbs  an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.
I ordered a 6p in this dress so it wld fall above my knees & be slightly smaller than a regular 6. sometimes a regular size 4 works  sometimes a 6. typically a regular size 6 is big on me. i am 5'3"  118#  36c. just recd the 6p in the mail. the first thing i noticed is that it's s a knit fabric that looks & feels like polyester although says 'cotton' on the inside label. i think it wld be a bit warm in hot weather  but that is just my observation. the main problem is that it is too big on each s
Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!
I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m  which is my normal retailer size  but couldn't move my arms. took it back  was going to try in a l  but store didn't have any. for the price  i need to be able to move my arms!
Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable  looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering  but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.
Very comfortable nightgown  love that it had pockets. fit is as expected.
I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.
This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!
This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.    the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
Based on the other reviews  i ordered a l and xl even though i would normally order a m. the l fits like a slightly fitted m without being too tight; the xl  of course  is a little larger  but not like a typical xl  certainly not sloppy-looking or oversized. the material is soft and the dark blue is lovely. i will be keeping both sizes. i would most likely not have been happy with a m.
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
This dress is gorgeous in person  soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe  but well worth it.
I wanted to love this top. but  it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful  but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.
Very cute and flattering but i'd order at least one size down. i'm usually a 25/26  and just during the time i tried on the 25s in the store  i could tell they'd loosen up enough for a 24. i'll review more once i have them  had to order since they don't typically have 24s in store  so can't comment on quality as of yet.
I ordered the green and lilac. the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option. i found that it ran true to size  but was a loose fit. the lilac color had white streaks from the the-dyed effect  but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on. for now  i am keeping the green one  but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model. i do like that it is 100 percent cotton and very so
I wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back. upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing. secondly  it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference  i ordered the 3  and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.
I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.
Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person  i'm only 5'4". really wanted to like this...
This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom  but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering  even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode
I love ag jeans. i own several pair  and i think they wash well  and wear well. that being said  i'd never purchased a pair of the "stevie" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag  and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans  but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me  the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived  they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except  w
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.
This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.
I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small  32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.
So stunning  i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.
Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und
I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model  but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness  not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"  124lb  34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!
I wrote item ran large  but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice  but it does have some issues.
Originally got one with a stain. retailer quickly sent a replacement   useful with many skirts and pants. well made.
Love the colors on this adorable  flattering style!
I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top  dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!
An odd top.  for my curvy figure (34g)  the seam did not enhance  but rather made me look wider.  the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.
This top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured  nice pattern and could be dressed up or down  the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch   however  the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top  sadly  i think i may send it back.
The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.
I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price  it really should be cut better.
I love bows   this dress is very cute and flattering  while being comfortable. it may be sleeveless  but i think with the right boots and cardigan  it can be brought into fall easily. color is a nice green. i tried on both the 00p and 0p  and though i loved the fit of the 00p better (width)  i preferred the length of the 0p - otherwise  not much difference there... i think it is well worth keeping it  even though i don't need yet another dress... material is pretty comfortable too. back is lower
Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
Even on sale  this was just too pricey for what it is  which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps  but it hangs very wide off your chest.
I ordered the blouse in black. it's not quite black but maybe in between a brownish gray. very pretty color. it fits just right. would have like it just a tad longer.
Mine was slightly tight across the bust area  but i'm able to leave it open with a light tank underneath. it still looks great!
This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.
Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.
This is an amazingly soft and gorgeous sweater. i typically avoid this brand because most of their pieces run smaller on my frame however this not only fit perfect but it is a beautiful color as well! i prefer transitional pieces that can be worn multiple seasons and this one is just right.
I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24  i wouldn't bother with these.
I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"  112lbs...with a small frame.
Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4" 118lbs  athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this)  but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it  however  it is not "flowy." it fits okay in the shoulders  almost too loose  and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!
I had reservations about this top based on other reviews  but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin  but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.
I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy  sleeves way too long  etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line  you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.
I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.
I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.
First  let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground  the tones of rose  pink  purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large  as i am 5' 3" and usually an size 6  but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped  it is a tad big  but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress  as it does not flare out in any way  but is certainly is loose and flowing  bu
Looks great on the model  but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.
Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.
I bought the s; came with a tag saying "sz 8". it is in fact more like a size 2  if not 0.     the bust is probably a 34 a or b  or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well  but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it  so i will return it.     the fabric  design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.
I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers  it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well.
So pretty & comfortable! love it!
I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft  true to size  comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish  casual top that can take me through all the seasons.
The arm slits are actually subtle  and don't gape open. the chiffon type pleats are lovely  but the cotton material they overlay appears cheap and isn't dressy enough for my work.
Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design
This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.
I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning  classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear.
It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
Omg!! i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous!! fits me like a glove. lovely rich reds and quality..... for reference i'm 5'2 and 99 lb and the 00 petite was perfect i could have even gone with the 00 regular. if it's within your means i highly recommend. :d
I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles  this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge  ordered an xxsp  the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said  "that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan
This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person  the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft  though. returned it!
This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty  perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty  but the fit is selective  so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
I love these jeans! i really like the way they fit and haven't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have.
I love this dress. it's cool and comfortable in this crazy heat! the fabric has a great feel to it. i do wish it was just a little longer..     (i'm 5'8"  145#  and bought a medium)
The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.
I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.
Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps!
Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore  showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the "side breast" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!
I ordered:  xsp  xxs  xxsp    xxsp was the better fit  some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said  ti was comfortable  the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders  and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!
I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute  but it is not "red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color  which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.
I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute  having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings  seaside strolls  chilly restaurants  or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great  i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.
When i saw this shirt  i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers  and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin  so i hope it stays in good shape. until then  i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.
Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms  the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.
This is  like many reviewers stated  a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great  because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm  only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me  and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young  too trendy? i don't know  when you're in your 40s  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel
I wear jeans so much  therefore i love to a variety in color. these jeans are so comfortable. they are like wearing sweat pants  but they truly keep their shape so well. i bought the red  which is a year around red  kind of a bright apple red. i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans.
I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8") and don't want to wear a crop top.
Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.
I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse  jacket and heeled sandals they are professional  with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.
I was very impressed upon receiving this dress. i'm 5'3  102lbs and ordered xs. fit perfect. i am also a 32dd  so if you are smaller than a d or big c  the top portion might be a little big for you. love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra. i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements.
This is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closet.  and  i love the western theme which isn't at all girly. usually i purchase v-neck items because  they suit me best  but i couldn't pass up the idea of cactus and succulents. it will be a fun  shirt to wear.
I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty  just as pictured.
Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very "retailer" piece so most likely i will keep it  just a bit disappointed.
This dress has a charming "carefree" look that invites fall.
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.
It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better  probably too short for my age (40s).
This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.     the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.
I love this sweater  especially the sleeves. i'm 5'2 and athletic so i don't' feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it!
I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.
The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
I loved the design and material of the test  but unfortunately it just did not fit me right. it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for.   also the pattern did not look good on me.   unfortunately i had to return.
These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.
This top is great - lightweight and flattering.  i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans.   i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.
Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.
I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.
When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well  and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable  but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...
I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!
Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus  i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!
It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute.
Super cute and comfortable. has a shape  not boxy.
This dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful. fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring. hugs all the right places. true to size. i am 5'2 and 120lbs  curvy and the small fit well. i am so happy with this purchase. great price point as well
I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that "give " so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing  as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom  with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l
Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.  i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite  i'd try it.  it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
I've been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online  we visited san francisco this weekend & i finally got my chance. it fit great & was flattering! i am currently pregnant & it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly. i would definitely recommend! <3
Yes  this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on  oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d
I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.
The fabric is more sweater-like than it appears in the image  but it makes the dress both cozy and comfortable. the skirt is a faux wrap that's secured at the waist by the tie. overall  the dress is high-quality  true to fit  and very flattering.
I had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit. i'm normally a 10-12  preferably a petite. i ordered this in a large and i couldn't begin to zip it up. it also ran extremely short in the crotch area. very pretty print but it's going back!
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
I got so many compliments from friends  i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6" and a heathy 160 lbs  carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate  it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large.
This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit  the fringed part was huge  kind of "maternity." i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously  it cannot be altered. so sad  must return.
I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store  so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in  meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are
This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material  it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me  but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.
Beautiful skirt! the only reason i didn't give a five star rating is due to some bunching on each side - hopefully can iron it out or i will get it tailored!
Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress  but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite  also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit  but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
I saw this in the store in blue and loved it. wore it and received lots of compliments. just bought the second color online as there is free shipping today. great dress for work as the weather is warming up.
I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it's supposed to be a little oversized looking)  great color (i have the ivory and it's beautiful)  and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos  but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings  skirts or just jeans.
This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape  and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint  and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating  is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating  but not enough that i won't keep the dress.
This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric  has some stretch  big pockets with cute lining  buttons are adorable  perfect knee length  sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big  the pocket line is visible on my thigh area  so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves  your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character  but it!!
I had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well  and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.
I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
Super cute pants  fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist  and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however  when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them.
What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips  but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
Bought this in dark grey  which has a lovely bluish hue. the fabric is soft & comfy and it has great lines for a knit fabric. very flattering! the sleeves are nice and long.
I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.
Thought this looked so cute  especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large  the fabric felt super cheap  and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned.
I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!
First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin
I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
I got this shirt in a medium  my normal retailer size and while the short fit  the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back  however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed  and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.
I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.
Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
Love this sweater and it is so soft and cozy cause it has a little wool in it...not scratchy at all.  5'4 138# usually wear size 6.  i got a small regular (not petite).  looks great with leggings and skirts not to long for a shorty like me.
I'm on the shorter (5''3") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it.
This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order  please take the
Very nice top  like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am  and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think  just not a flattering oversize fit for me
I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend  and i have to say i already know it will become an easy  go-to top. it does run large  so consider that when choosing what size to order. i generally wear a medium  but purchased a small in this top.
I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5 9" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said  the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely  soft and i liked the gray color  but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.
So  i really like this sweater  as you'd expect for this price point  it's stylish in a very single way. so glad i read the review before mine to size down. the xs is great and i wouldn't want bigger. i love the length: how it goes long and cones in a little at the bottom  and the pockets are higher(i always need pockets for my phone). the stripes are well draped as the sweater transitions from shoulder to arm. the cuffs are fun  too.   bottom line:  i'm really glad this came on sale and i snatc
This top has great lines and has a very flattering fit.
I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel  color (grey) and style of the dress  but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.
I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.
Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.
I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning.
My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr
I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.
I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
Love this versatile cardigan  have both blue & orange colors & they're beautiful. it's light weight yet cozy. true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up.
This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool  so dry clean only. though it is wool  it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy.  .  i am a size xl  but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders  everything else is very voluminous. for this reason  it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it  or bring it to a local seamstress who
I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too "flowy".
Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.
I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit  but the body seemed so wide on me  it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked  but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim  color is nice  overall  really pretty dress  just unfortunately big.    and i have wide shoulders.    30dd chest  26.5 in wasit  big legs  115 lbs.
According to the label  this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label  and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.
I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.
This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored  an xs looked better. i am 5'5" 118 lbs  34c  slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day.
I'll start this by saying i usually wear a m or l depending on the shirt. i'm 20 weeks pregnant and ordered a medium. it's huge! i was thinking i would be able to wear this for a bit while preggo and then would be able to wear it after baby with no problem. i'm going to order a small because the fabric is so soft and i love the design and color.
I love this shirt! great fabric  nice quality  flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy  and the white is actually oatmeal.
I purchased this blouse in black. love it. this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail. it is perfect! my only wish is that it came in a colors. i would add navy  red  green  white. i'm tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out. buy it - you won't be sorry.
The pattern and colors are very pretty  and the material is soft and silky. i returned it  though  because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts  which is not going to work for me.
This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle
Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it  it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found. the fit is nice but i wouldn't buy it due to the material being too delicate.
I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.
I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.
I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim  grey  or olive green dresses and shirts.
Very soft material  length is great  a little more loose than i would have liked.
I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.
I loved the print on both  but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit  size down. for myself  m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long  covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design  so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.
The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo
I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal  and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!
I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.
I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high.  i'm 5'1" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly.  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn't versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn't in love with it  i returned
Pretty design  but when i tried it on  the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier  it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
I'm 60+  in relatively decent shape  135 lbs  and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing  which came well below my knees  and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee  the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress  so i left it about 3" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body  and with the right undergarments  it is super comfortable and attractive. go
These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.
This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.  the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold  gentle  cycle and they were stained/     i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s
I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were "felted" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28") and the skirt sits at the smallest part
I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...
I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist  there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one  it will need to be altered.  it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a
I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online  but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo
The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.
I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!
I like that i can wear this over anything  only drawback is that it's short-sleeved so it semi-defeats the purpose of having a cardigan but- it's so pretty i can't return it!
I loved this on the mannequin and assumed it would look terrible on me. i tried it on anyway and was delightfully surprised. i tried a small and it was too roomy in the top so i opted for the extra small. i'm 5'6" and 130 lbs  (27 in jeans  34a). my booty definitely fills it out but the rest of the fit is similar to the model. it is hard to get on and off but if you tie a looser bow before slipping it over your head it's much easier to get back on and you can tighten it up again fairly easily. f
I fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it. the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog - the picture of the model walking on the beach. in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isn't going anywhere - for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be re-sewn. some of
I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however  it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.
I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them.
I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a
I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.  it runs quite large  in my opinion. i'm 5'7" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light)  but i don't think this is a problem  necessarily. had it been thicker  it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.
As everyone said  the fabric weighs and therefore the romper is flowing gracefully. and it is real soft. you can wear it without bra. it looks so flattering but still feels so comfortable. it is the reason that i placed an order online and it is also the first piece out of the package that i paired with excitement and went out full of contentment. the only thing is that i received mine with the place where the two bands meet with the back broken. i had to sew them all together. it almost felt li
This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft  fully lined  and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges.   .  i got the size 's' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d  32c  even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back  but i
This tee was meant to be loose and swishy  but as it runs large  sizing down means the sides come up really high  as they curve a good 3-4" higher up. so your waistband is exposed  and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.
I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did  thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress.
This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream  but wow is it short! i'm 5'8" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse.     because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt  i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies  but tall & curvy ladies beware.
I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture  loose and flowy.
I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
These bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky! i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage.
As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.
I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however  i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it  the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch  but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it  so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this  i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.
I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
Overall  very nice pair of boyfriend style jeans. super comfy. i asked one of the in store stylist for help styling them- she was very helpful and showed me lots of possibilities for these pants. also good for a post-partum tummy :)
I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust  and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee  but sadly  that wasn't the case.
If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website)  but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand)  and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase  absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.
I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however  i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me.
This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely  design and quality are impeccable  and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!
I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person. i am 5'7" 126 lbs and bought the medium. it is more fitted than how it is on the model. it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable. i'm glad i have it!
The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.
I saw this online & wondered abt the sleeve length on me. i was thinking about ordering the petite size since i'm only 5'3". sometimes cardigans have longer sleeves than i want. it was at the local store so i tried on the regular xs in the grey. the fit & sleeve length was fine. what i didn't care for was a slight itchiness (wool fiber) & some mild shedding (alpaca fiber). i decided against it but it is nice looking. 5"3"  117#
This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.
I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however  i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...
It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...   however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
Perfect for the weekend  purchased the purple  it is a nice soft purple  great with jeans. xs petite was perfect. (115 lbs)
Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.
Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!
When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that's gonna have to go back
I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!
Fits a bit on the bigger side  but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat  vest  or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.
These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy  stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?  116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off  the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!
I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!
Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment  i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately  this one's going back.
After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5" 36c 126lbs
I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.
I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit  and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.
This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw in-store while making an online return. for whatever reason i didn't notice this one online but loved it in person. the fit is easy going and flattering  i took a small as the shoulder fit would've been a little tight in the xs. great dress for transitioning seasons :)
I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate  but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces  a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow
I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect  enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color  my store had this in black
I love these pants - the color is great  the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers  i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling  i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-4 tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry
This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful  and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts. it is very high waisted  and at 5'8" the length was similar to the model.
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state  it is short and wide. i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.
I love the model's pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store! like the other reviewer said  you could dress up or down (despite the "sweatshirt" name) and i'm planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties. love the stitched pockets on the side! (but i'm unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out!)    sizing: definitely boxy as the first reviewer said. i'm solidly a small in most tops  and this one i have a bit of spare
My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!
Tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems - 1. not made for c cup bra women or larger and 2. the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest  so when you see yourself at a profile view  there's these ruffles that look like they're coming out of your chest. just sayin'. not for me.
I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
Love this little number. very flattering  warm  and soft. color goes with everything  i tried it on with a slip dress  and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite  and it fit like a glove  with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite  as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small  but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on.  115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look  so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me  but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress  the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags  etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.
I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.
These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle. i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift.
I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two  if not three  sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body  other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough  especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w
This dress is adorable in the photo; however  in reality  it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering  i would have sized down  but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly  i must return.
I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not
This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size  though a bit boxy  so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side  but i'm petite  so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear  but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.
Very flattering to a woman's figure. can dress up or down.
I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear  i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper  outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all  but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.
This top is really cute and i love the design. however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling.
This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.
This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement  i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!
I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib  the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something
The perfect pair. i am 5'6". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.
This "little" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt  but that only adds to the appeal  and is well done  not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece.
Super cute  a little buggier than expected but great for layering after the gym.
Love this top. fits me perfect. i am bigger on top and received many compliments in this shirt.
The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes)  but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though  because it's a pretty shirt and different.
Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already  so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big  so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.
I love cotton fabric  so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color  and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once  and today when i put it on again  i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.
These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1" and normally wear a 24 25  or 0. you will not regret this purchase.
I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7
This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent  and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist  so keep that in mind. the only t
Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).
Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.
I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee
I tried this on in the store  in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one  i could go either way.  the cut is flattering fit and flare  and the colors are rich. i like the "flowery" design  good spring piece in my opinion  as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material  buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy  very soft. not too flimsy iether.
It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
Love this top  but the xs is still way too big  swallows me. 5'1" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly  had to return this item.
Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida  stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray  soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable  classy and sexy.
My new favorite top to throw on
I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.
I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.
Bought a pair of the gray and loved them  but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine.     so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem?     anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a "washed look" that's on purpose.     i'll still wear them  but an expe
I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
This is a wonderful style.
Although i love the soft feel of the sweater  the zig zag design was very unflattering. also  the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.
These are the perfect pants for the hourglass figure  i needed sz 4 but the store was sold out in my sz plan to order . these pants are light weight and fit in all the right spots   don't show any flaws on legs and i do have them  but they are very complimentary to my figure . they are also really hip without being over the top or weird.
This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it
I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly  the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo
Overall  it's a beautiful dress  and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price)  and as other reviewers have mentioned  it's just a tad too short. for reference  i'm 5'5  125 lbs and the 2 fit well  but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.
After reading the reviews  these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal  but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2"  134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs  from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t
I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.
I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders  but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side  but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up  a size 6 instead of my usual 4  and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately  the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress  i'm not denying that  but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a
These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(
I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s
Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.
Cozy  soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.
I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve
Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it  even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress  which i feel this is. once i tried it on  i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point  an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft  comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there  but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath.
I saw this online and thought  hmm  no. then saw it in the store  touched it  and the fabric felt so soft. i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier  but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store. the 4 just looked promising. i thought i'd try it on for laughs. but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home. the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom  5'2  145 lb figure. my measurements are 34(b)-29-38  and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular! perfect length a
I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it  no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer  bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.
I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy  the sleeves too long  and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very  very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers  but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed  especially given the price  but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac
Love this top-i love the colors  flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
At 6' tall  it's hard to find pants that fit my inseam (35") and these fit the bill. i normally wear a 30 or 31 tall in pants (from brands like ag or paige)  but i bought these in a 29 tall as i find pilcro tends to run large. they are soft and comfortable and don't stretch out 3 sizes by the end of the day  which is great. they feel like leggings! the wine color looks just like the images. for those who find measurements helpful  i'm 6' tall  160lbs with about 42" hips and a 35" inseam.
I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(
I love these bottoms they are super cute  comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.
This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.
I'm tall and small chested so the dress didn't fit me perfectly. i adore the color and pattern  but wish it was less revealing in the chest area. i definitely have to wear something under. otherwise high quality and unique dress!
I ordered the medium  my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely  looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.
Never want to take this tee off  so comfy  & neutral  ecru stripe  with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb! goes with a ton of items from my own closets! need more in every color/print/stripe......just feels ooh  soooo good
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?
I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.
This is what a bathing suit should look and feel like. no crawling up the cheeks :) no spillage out the front. i would say it's true to size or a little on the large size. i'm 5'4 122 and ordered a medium which was great for me. maybe a small would have been ok but i couldn't be happier. good job! color is true to the pic. quality seems nice and sturdy.
I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would've maybe fit me in this top. it's so billowy and not fitted at all.
I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase  no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece
This looks cute on the model but was way too big  loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs  but returned it. it is an okay black top  nothing great.
I love sweaters like this. it's perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it's soft  comfy  and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open  there is a snap to fasten it if you want to.
I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first  it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in  throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional  wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece
I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot  it had a flattering fit on me  extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct
I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green  so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes  the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6  and this one the 8 fit perfectly  so maybe one size up.
This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn't wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5'5" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too 'long and heavy' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn't work for my body type  making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are  made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a
I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress. i love the flowy fabric  the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print. i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m (with the intention to hem) and i find it too large in the bust. i'm going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better. for reference i am 5'3" 36dd 140#.
I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7  115 lbs  wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish  but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately  when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester  and while it's machine washable (yay)  i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily  and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price  so i returned it.
Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short. 
I had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion. as soon as i saw this  i knew it was perfect for the occasion. i'm sure i'll get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down.
Seeking the perfect "go-to" dress? this one will work for day or night  and it's an ideal match for transition seasons. the best part? the cut. swing dresses and shifts can "tent" my slightly "top-heavy" frame. this dress brags a side-zipper and slight tapering through waist to create an a-line. the small petite fits tts for me at 5'4 size 2 to 4. the fabric is a high-quality  textured fabric - wrinkle free  and a great pick for travel. best investment i've made this spring.
The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6" and it was 3" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.  an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.  the fabric is quite beautifu
This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.     very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.
I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit
I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.
Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy  polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening  with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down  it looks great with a denim jacket  then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short  sandals  pumps  you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone  loosely tied  or done in a bow. leggings or ti
Lots of embellishment  striking magenta color  feels great on  with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!
Cute  swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so  size down!
I'm not sure what it is with ag. i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans  in blue  black and white denim. i wish i could say they're all great  but unfortunately there's a big variation in how they wash  depending on the fabric content. i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring  but after washing them once i can see they won't be a favorite pair. even with cold water and hanging them to dry  the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes. at this price po
This vest is very nice and fashionable  very stylish. i like it a lot. however  it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however  the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere  so i could not imaging wearing this vest  it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
This is a gorgeous bathing suit. the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture  and much more beautiful. comfortable  chic  and unique
It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back. not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat
This is such a beautiful top  so flattering  soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue  a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color.
I love  love this top! it's the perfect peplum tee! i would get more if this was offered in more color combos! the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and it's a perfect soft cotton. can't say enough about this one!
This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy  i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist  i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty
I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3  it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough  it should work for you!
I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.
I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color  but frankly  that's about it.
I tried on this dress in store and was amazed by the quality and simple structure of the dress. bought it with no hesitation.
I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it  i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.
I went to the retailer store to look for an outfit for a wedding. i tried on a lot of dresses and the staff was super helpful with pulling items and making recommendations. after trying on their pulls  i browsed the store for myself and found this skirt. it wasn't in my size but i tried it on anyway and paired it with several different tops recommended by staff. this skirt looks great with every top-black  cream  white  long sleeve  no sleeve  short sleeve. i thought i had to get it for the versat
I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it. plus it is very comfortable. i would highly recommend it!
This is the softest most comfortable dress ever. i bought a large because it was the only one in stock at the store. i'm 5'9  135 and it's a little loose but still flattering and comfortable due to my height. if you are tall you will not be disappointed w this dress!
I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing  but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.
I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty
Great idea  but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked  but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price  it did not justify a place in my closet?
I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5" and 140 pounds.
This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back  but also the cut has the scroll print running
While there is nothing wrong with this top  it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store  maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much  especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.
This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath  but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest  but this was ridiculous. beyond that  the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale  it was not worth the price and i returned.
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!
I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist  but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin  and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference  i am 5'-7" 155lbs  usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large.
Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
This sweater is ok. i love  love  love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring  but once it arrived  i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also  it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on
Purchased this fun  feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to  but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans  oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is  i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!
This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side  not the front. very unflattering on me.
As one would expect from boucle  this sweater is incredibly soft  warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful  goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling)  and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs  with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline  color  the quality of lace
I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well  although  i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up  but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!
Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3").
I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however  i tried it on  and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide  but the length is good  and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.
The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy  it was too flimsy  the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7" 135 the dress was long enough  just didn't flow very well.
This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice  vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!
I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on  and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top  cropped jeans  and sandals.
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.
First of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said  it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c
I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt  the top fit a bit odd  not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it  and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy  it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases  and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.
Disappointed  the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful
This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th
This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it 4 stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!
These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.
I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the "coats" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open  the coat looked great but when i trie
This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful  vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size. now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product.
Wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes. i am 5'7"  160lbs  34dddd  and the size large was the correct size.
I love  love  love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say  i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you  the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels  but i also like it with boots as
Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
But when i saw this top in person  urged by my stylist when they got it in  i decided to try it on. they had xs in store  my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look  and not sure if smaller would work  i decided to order all three: xxs  xsp and xxsp!    verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes  kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right  but arm holes were a little high  not as comfortable.  xsp ended up being the right c
Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes  but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size  do size up.
This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5" tall  138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread.  it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show
So  i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms  armpit  thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length  but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and
This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive  even on sale  for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it.
Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
Sporty  comfortable and good option to replace jeans  however material needs to be ironed. i bought these as a nice (dressier) alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didn't end up wearing them b/c an iron wasn't readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy. best to wear these with shoes that don't come above ankle.
May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.
120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me  i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.
This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.
I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.
I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor
Everything about this dress is exceptional. the fit  material  workmanship  and style are wonderful. the dress even has 2 petticoats to make the skirt stand out. the dress is modern in style  yet classic.
I bought this top in both colors. the fit is perfect  the styling is very cute and it also is very comfortable!!  the only bad thing is that it snags on my jewelry !! :(. if it weren't for that i would rate it a 5!!
I have not a actually purchased this coat yet but was able to try it on at my local retailer. thought i'd pass along a couple of details the description is missing. the coat is not lined. i have regular length arms and the sleeves are a bit short  not quite 3/4 length but not long enough to keep my wrists warm. also  i was afraid the red would be more orange  it is a very pretty red. it also runs a little big. i am 5'4" medium  athletic build and would probably consider a m but it seemed bi
This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!
Yes  it's a swing top  just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me  being top heavy  so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge  with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top  which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.
I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet  the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit  feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive  sturdy and very comfortable to wear  even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings  parties  etc.)
This is a great "go to" top. it isn't too low  too tight  too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly  especially under the arms  (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go "too" low. i have to admit  i purchased the dusty rose color  i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin  but i love it anyway.
This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction.
I can tell this is will be a "go to" shirt this summer. simple lines  yet a little "different" style - soft stripes  slits on the side seams and short  but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans  dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts  but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape.
The top is so soft  and the lace detail in the backs makes this your no-so-average chambray top. the fit is flattering for a curvy figure.
I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..
I really like the color of this and the feel  but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with  and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it  but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
I thought this dress would make me look washed out  but absolutely doesn't--beautiful pop of color  and unique design. i've received many complements  this one is a keeper.
I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality  the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down  i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b
The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through  and added a white cami.    sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands  and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5" tall  135 lbs  35-29-36  34d  long torso  narrow across the shoulders  and short arms.     fit: loose fitting t's l
I ordered these in a size small on sale  thinking that because of the material  they might not fit. they are actually very cute  and fit in the waist/legs  but in the crotch area  as another reviewer mentioned  they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.
Not great quality  runs a bit lose  disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)
Super soft fabric! the opening in the back makes it very chic.
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
I am ever in search of a light  white  summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers  and each of them is the scratchy  starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.
I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large  or something? ! i ordered an xs  my usual size  xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose  the upper arms are a bit snug  and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place  but when you look at the model  it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received  and another reviewer  the seam was puffy  making for a strange look. in theory  the shirt should have worked  but didn't. i loved the pattern  not the fit.
I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"  but it fe
I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
This top is has an awkward neckline  doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw  and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty  but that is it :(
Great top for day to night. fine for work (i'd think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned  but b cup and below doesn't gape so very work appropriate.)
I'm 5"0" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide  and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also  not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.
In both senses  it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out  and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs  if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not).  (115 lbs  30 dd  26-27 inch waist)    that being said  it is really cute and fun and flirt  but not romantic flirty  just girl next door flirty.  the navy and white stripes are classic  so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering  i really love it  just not on me being that
This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.
I love love love this top! so flattering and comfortable- looks great with jeans  leggings  or i totally plan to use it as a beach cover-up as well. they only had medium left (i usually get xs/s) but it was still as flattering and i usually like my clothes on the roomy side!
This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
Lovely top  well made and feels wonderful on. attention petites - i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured.
Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!
I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt  it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands  and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available  that would have been better in length  but it was not so i had them hemmed.
This is a beautiful warm cardigan! just from the picture thought it was going to be longer. bought to wear with leggings but can't. i will wear it with jeans skirts and dresses. i am 5 feet 7.
I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean  but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture  which is fine  though i was digging the slightly greyed look.    anyway  these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build  so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs 
This dress is so cute and so comfortable. i will be wearing this to a lot of different kind of events. i am so happy with this purchase.
I ordered this top in rose. (the color is actually more of a cream with navy and yellow stripes but i could tell that from the photo when i was ordering). the fit is true to size and the cut is very flattering. excited to add this gem to my summer wardrobe!
There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!
I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough  but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with "real pants" and
This dress was very cute the first time i wore it  but after my second wear  the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward.
The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.
So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :)
Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however  it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist  it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me  but i think on the right girl  it would be very cute.
I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.
This shirt had everything going for it - the cut  the length  the fun texture  but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing  but still cute.
These run tiny. i wear a 25/26 in pants and took a medium in this bottom and i'm still not completely comfortable with the fit. love the floral print  but with a bottom this small you don't really see much of the flowers so on mine at least it's just some splashes of different dark colors.
Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3''  118lbs  and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.
I never would have given these pants a second look online  in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me  i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer
The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
This bodysuit will be a staple for me this winter. i wear it own its own and under just about everything. i just ordered another one!
I got one of these tanks  and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray  green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me  but that's no problem. the shirts are darling  they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way  but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow  and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones  i don't love bright colors but i love the green  white
This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however  it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"  140lbs  32dd). going back unfortunately.
Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.
Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
Love the diving beauty version  it is charming without being too "cutsie" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in  tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!
I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.
Designs are nice and texture feels comfortable  but sleeves are odd because they are angled.  i wonder what i should do to look cool in this t-shirt.  i tried wearing neutral motif  but i still felt odd.  also  width is relatively wide  so it runs large.  i rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelings.  personally  i do not recommend this t-shirt  but who knows  it may be right for you...  so  my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo
This skirt is amazing! it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape. i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly. i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect. but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing. i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re
These are very nice pants. good quality and as expected. however  they do run small. i generally wear a small or size 4  sometimes a 2 depending on the maker. on average a 4. these i measured were 0 to 2 sizing. sending back and going a size up.
I bought this in the orange color. might not be the color for everyone but with my coloring looked great  very similar to the picture online. fit is perfect  very comfortable. the fabric is night  stretching but flattering. bought this with the 30% off sale  not sure i would have paid full price based on the fabric. but love that i got if for extra off the sale. wish the others were in stock because i would have bought them too.
Ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed
I bought the lavender one and i'm so glad i did. the sweater looks prettier in person and it's super soft! the back detailing makes this one not your average v-neck sweater. i highly recommend this to anyone!
A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric  bunchy skirt  teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.
I ordered my usually size  xs  and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.
If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.
This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.
I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size  and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open  but only to your stomach.
The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.
The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.
I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in  but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose  but not that loose. i'm 5'8" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for
I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5'4" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it's like burnt chemicals. i don't know if it's just this pair  or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can't get rid of the smell. :(
I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.  the "shawl" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed. i already returned this.
Great color. great length. will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeans/pants. this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold.
Like another reviewer  i was in the store looking for the vest with the faux fur collar and tie-waist. it turned out to be too long/bulky for my small frame  or there wasn't an xs (can't recall)  but i saw this and it's just the thing i didn't even know i needed. i'm fairly thin and petite at 5'4 and drown in most cardigans. this is just long enough. it was a subtle a-line shape. fabric is not thick but is substantial enough that it's still warm. i also like that it's hand washable  nice to have
Recently bought these on sale  though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2" and typically a size 4  the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model  but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas  and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy  as sometimes happens with this style.
I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous  but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants. i hate probably 99% of the pants i try on. pilcro is the consistent exception  and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros (perhaps tied with the cords). runs true to pilcro size  which i find to be a bit large--most of my other pants are a 30  and a 29 is quite comfortable in these. despite being leggings  they're thick/structured enough to wear to work.
I ordered this because i can&#39;t resist denim shirts.  i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the full-length  bronze zipper in the back is to die for.  it looks great with everything!
The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.
This cozy sweater looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. as a 55-year-old woman who loves retailer i'm always on the lookout for cute clothes that don't make me look like i'm trying to dress too young. this sweater is comfy and stylish and looks really classy. i wore it to a holiday party and got many compliments  which is unusual for what is basically a simple ivory sweater. it breathes  has just the right amount of room in the sleeves  and was a great purchase. i wish i had bought other colo
Wonderful shirt  soft and flattering... usually wear a medium  but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium  but large is not frumpy at all
Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point  it probably has to go back :(
These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight  just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length   hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however  if i were any heavier  i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin  in most cases i would size up.
Cute and very soft  but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
I absolutely love the look & style of this piece! perfect for summer evenings. only complaint is that it feels maybe a bit too delicate. fabric is quite lightweight  and may be easy to tear. i will be taking special care of this & hoping to keep it looking great for the season.
Beautiful material and taupe color. the slits are pretty high on both sides  so just be aware of that.
I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite  it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea
I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on  and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger  but  in fact  it's a very surprising find  as others have mentioned. _____________ pros: - a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit. - the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this. - lots of stretch and very  very comfortable. i can see myself wearing
Beautiful and flowy blouse . bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down - 1 size. very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern. i am a 36c on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties.
This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size  however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs  ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!
I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5"3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!
I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref  5'8"  135 lbs  34-b)  but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is  and certainly lovely.
The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size.
So i thought this sweater would be snowy white  but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive  i do like it  just because it is not snowy white like i thought  it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
This shirt is not what i expected. i ordered the "green" motif  which is not green at all but black. in the product photos the drawings appear to have a white outlining but its brown. the shirt is made of a good quality cotton and fits great. i ordered the medium. which gave me a lot of extra room to where i could have sized down to a small. for reference i am a 36b and usually wear a medium in most retailer tops. i don't plan on keeping this because i was really hoping for a white background to t
I love this tunic! it runs slightly large. i ordered my usual size small (i am 5'4'' 125lbs) and it is a looser fit but falls nicely. i wear it as a dress  and the blue/gray color is so pretty!
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.
I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.
I'm 5'5"  125 lbs  34c and the xs fit perfectly. very soft  feminine top. i got many compliments the first day i wore it. wire it for business casual  but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more 70's look. highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top.
This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric  not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.    the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.
I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color  a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium  and it was too tight in the chest  and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med
Love the blue color  and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair. the hem is cool. love the big cuffs. but i looked like the liberty bell in the small. it is huge through the hips! not at all like on th model. i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms. returned :(
This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.
I wanted to love this dress  but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue  but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling  but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust  and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my
I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
The fabric is very comfortable and soft.  love it - great fit.(tts)  would recommend
I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
This dress had beautiful details  and the material was better than i expected; however  it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.
Gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed
I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those  but after trying both pairs on  i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro  but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8  which is what i seem to we
Love this vest. it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well. not bulky  so it's a great piece to layer over flannels. it has a bit of stretch.
Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.    great  versatile shirt.
I love that these are a nice thin stretchy material (not in a bad or cheap way) because they are perfect for the warm weather as well. i got the color grey in a size 29. i usually wear a 29 in stevie's so they were tts. maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear. i did try on the size 30 but they were a little big around the waist. for reference i am 5'6"  145lbs  size 6/m. the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places. i have wider calves and it
This is such a beautiful top. i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape. also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust. sadly  returning.
Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.
This dress is amazing! it fits true to size  very flattering and the fabric is beautiful!  i am 5'4" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch  but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee.  just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!
This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy.
I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
This skirt is stunning. like the other reviewer  i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet. the colors are just striking. it is also flattering - i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk  this one lays nice and flat and looks great. the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom. i am just between 5"3" and 5'4" and weigh 112 lbs; i took an xs and it fits perfectly  so it seems true to size. only thing  if you are
I love this tank top...the fringe on the bottom is fun  and i've gotten many compliments on it already...i think it runs true to size :-)
I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say
This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.
Sadly  this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.
Most comfortable and great looking! i got complements from everyone! literally!
I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.
I was out of town when my coat arrived  and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet  but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7" and heavier than i'd like  but the xl fit perfectly!
I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.
I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined  but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.
I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!
Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit  but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall  winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f
I bought this sweater the minute i saw it  and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order (it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it).   i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it... i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane.   i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later  the sweater had not one  not two  but three differen
I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect  the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however  the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.
I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite  short-waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.    i returned the dress
I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy  oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu
Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large  so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized  but i love that look  and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b  126 lbs  5'10"
This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9  145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s  m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.
Love the cotton knit  for the comfort  but from a distance this blouse looks dressier. the embroidery adds a nice flare. personally  i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom  as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants. i found that it ran a little bit  but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway.
This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were "it's a standout". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!
This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try  and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!
The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top  arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.
Loved this top! bought it during the recent promo and thought the sale price more fair. i sized up because i wanted a swing-ier silhouette and more room at the neckline. the top is impeccably made and the embroidery is sturdy. i did not find the top see-thru and am wearing it with a racer back black bra and have no issues.
Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.
This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.
I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!
The cut on this is fantastic  every color way is vibrant and appealing. length just skims over where my hips broaden  which is nice  and my shoulders look strong and tan. however. i prefer cotton  or at least a cotton blend. this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks  the colors will never fade  and the shape won't change. i find the man made fabric very very hot  though.
While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.   also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium @ retailer  but i have a sm
The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at
Beautiful fabric! unfortunately  i had to return it. after just one wear  it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it  but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.
It is a beautiful coat  runs small. arms feel tight  i am typically xs  i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted  and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat  not really fit for cold weather.
This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off  as i fix  one shoulder  another will slide down. the material is nice but since it is not lined  it feels inexpensive  disposable.
This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well  nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store  but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.
I love the concept of an airy  flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however  i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.
This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist
This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.
I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust  tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).    overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.
This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!
Cute and different  looks good belted  will try with lace leggings
Yes these are a true clear red. not neon red or orange red  but a classic shade of red. these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. they are a nice weight for spring/summer without being too light or flimsy. they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better. i'd say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side. for reference my waist is 26 and hips are 35. the size 0 fits very well but the 2p were too big. ( i also take a 0 in the martie but those are slightly m
Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.
I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me.
The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.
These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down  and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"  155 lbs)  would look great on someone more slender.
These are nice jeans for the price. they are tight at first but do stretch out so i am glad i went with my normal denim size and didn't size up. i wish they didn't have a button fly but it didn't bother me enough to return them.
I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
So  so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
These are so comfortable! i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretch..this is my second pair of fleetwood from coh. love this style
Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.
I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit  i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didn't design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell  nor does it itch  as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color  but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1"  but ordered the regular xs  and i am happy with the length.
These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants!  the fabric is soft and light  and has some stretch  so i think they can be worn more fitted way  too.   i don't want to show off my bottom half of my body shape  so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine & not too loose.   i''m 5'3  115 lb and usually wear 25-26 jeans  25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look. i think 24 could fit as well  but would sn
These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging  because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it.
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.
I passed this over on first sight because it looked like it might be on the short side in length. after seeing a few other photos and reading the reviews  i opted to give it a go. the store did not have my usual xs or even a size small  so i tried on the medium. it was too wide as expected  but the shoulders are adjustable so i fiddled with it a bit and decided it was really cute. there were no more xs available to order so i asked if the store could order the small. it arrived and is absolutely
Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.
I bought the deep maroon which is beautiful. absolutely love the softness  length and the casual look. you can dress it up and dress it down. it does run big. i got the medium but could wear the small easily enough. since i am 6 feet tall  i wanted to length to be where it is. the only part i did not like is the 3/4 length sleeves as it is tough when wearing a jacket over it.
Love this tunic dress but i ordered a petite instead of regular because of length. fits a bit snug. i have gotten sp from retailer before and they have fit. just depends on the brand i guess. great holiday wear.
This dress was a disappointment. not black  but brown. and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly. on its way back...
I've been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale. the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it! this will be going back to the store!!!!
For my 5'9"  36 c bust  hourglass frame  and 170 lbs  i got the medium and found it fit well. a bit snug but i didn't want to go to large and have it too loose at the top. my thoughts below: __________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal. - the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck. it just gives it an edgy look that i really like. - this "grey" has actually a minuscule houndstooth-like or checkboard-like appearance that's ha
Really cute dress. i bought the white. i am usually a size 2 in retailer dresses but i could not even zip this! side zip was also slightly awkward. had to return  waiting for the 4.
I love this poncho/sweater. it feels cozy and looks really cool. can't wait til the weather cools down so i can wear it.
This is the perfect lounge/sleep cami! i am 5'1'' 120 lbs and purchased the dark purple small. it's hangs a bit loose - my preferred fit for sleeping shirts. good quality  easy washing (machine/delicate)  and cool and airy for hot summer nights.
This shirt fits beautifully  though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft  and the look classic and feminine.
Comfortable. flattering. i agree with other reviewers that this is great piece. i purchased the red one and it is beautiful. fits tts.
Love everything about this. the color is gorgeous - great fall addition to any wardrobe. the tassels are cool - usually don't like things like that.    i wear a small or medium in retailer  usually small  and i purchased the small.
This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats  etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.
I absolutely love this dress. beautiful  flattering shape with flowing light weight fabric. i'm so in love with this color. a great dress for a special night.
I am 5'9  very long waisted  generally a size 10-12 or med  but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up. (and this brand has run small in the past) i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width either way  this is a keeper!! it is adorable on  comfortable  my t-back bra works perfectly  very flattering  and way better than expected the shorts length is a little longer than pictured  but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an
I liked this top (in black)  but it didn't fit me well. had to return.
Just got this top in the mail today  and i love it. i bought the white in a small  and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton  but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined  so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large  as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer  and a lot of summers
I loved the lines in this jacket  but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
This is adorable and unique. i've tried shawls and ponchos before  they usually swallow me up  this sweater has that type of feel but isn't so much fabric. goes with everything.
In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders  the fabric didn't drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is  almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn't mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color  so pretty!
Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference  i say i am 5' 4" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4"  138-140 lbs.  36c bra. size-wise  i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room.
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
I ordered a small  which is my usual retailer size  but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long  a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.
I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales  and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty  comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic  this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra  and when i adjusted it higher  the soft  stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue  and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame  but i
I'm: 34a  125 lbs  5'8"  purchased: small    jacket fits well and is not too heavy. didn't feel tight in the arms. great to wear on a cool spring day! i bought the white and grey jacket.
The dress didn't meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made  it just wasn't right for me.
Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
I love the idea  and color  very flattrering and easy to trhrow on  however  i need the petite in this one  and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing  and since it combines xs/s  it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.
I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light  airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s
Love this dress! the other reviews were accurate. it is a lot of fabric and i can't decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with. but i think it would be a great  beachy dress for the summer.
This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters  so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium  so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6"). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral  but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!
This t shirt is huge. i am 5' tall  size xs and i am swimming in this xs. i'm trying a size down. it is meant to be oversized but this is extreme.
I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.
The lace front is more detailed than i expected  but in a good way. the sleeves are softer on the outside  but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said  in my opinion. it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where i'm sitting when wearing it. not a deal breaker though...
Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!
This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light  airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing  only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect.    ( for ref. 5'7'  140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing
This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great.     i'm 5"7  120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s  so i went with the s.
This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.
I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this  but where was quality control?
If you know one.september and you know what's good for you  then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way  this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co
I was so excited for this dress to arrive  but when it did  it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also  the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful  but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back
I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.
As other reviewers have pointed out  the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad  i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.
I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful  plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress!  it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys  it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it
I love this dress  but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small  but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on  but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work.
Love this top-that simple
As other reviewers mentioned  this sweater is truly nice in person. i love the different patterns from the fabric. the cut is also flattering  not boxy. the collar on me turend the other way around (dark showing)  and it also looked nice. i wasn't planning on buying anything  but it was thanskgiving weekend  with  you know  discount :-# not regretting it...  i will wear it many ways: jeans and tshirt for weekends #if i get out of my workout clothes#  but also could be worn over a nice black blou
I really like the style of this top  and it's delicate but well made  but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer  but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length  and ordered the xxs petite. also  you would have to cut the tag off if you d
Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge 
This is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design. i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots  but this definitely has a flare to it. it also has pockets. it feels a bit artsy to me which isn't normally my style  but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty. i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style  but i have larger arms  so  the arms were a bit snug in my normal size  but i didn't want to go up in size as the rest fit
I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.
Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned  wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic  maybe ribbons to tie  but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other  not both  and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design  i would
This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
I just revieved this skirt and like it a lot. they did not have my size in petite so i ordered the regular length . it is very long. i am 5'4 1/2 and tried it with 4 inch heels and still had about 2 inches dragging on the floor and will need to be hemmed. in this picture  the stitching around the flowers appear white but it is actuallly a shiny  delicate gold thread in person. hopefulluy it will not fray with wear. i initially got a white top to go with it and it works  but i think a red or navy
Comfortable tank  i'm short but it's a long tank  even in a taller frame.  i like that it covers my mid section.  beautiful blue color.
I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe
This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(
I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist
I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store  but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts)  and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low
This dress is such a crazy beautiful color  the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it  and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice  but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest  but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either  so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway  but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick  stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
This top is so soft  simple  and such a closet staple  if you get the right size! for reference  i am 5'3  128 lbs  and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color  hard to describe  kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!
Nice jeans  just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise  fine.
Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison  and i wish all reviewers would include this  i am 5'5" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it.
I really liked these jeans initially  but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat
This jacket isn't as structures as i thought but it is very comfortable. runs true to size and feels nice. i am looking forward to wearing this in the fall
This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch  the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all  so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality  i would definitely look into other items from this brand  but back this dress went.
I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews  i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately  it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest  and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.
Bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different. it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have it in an xs and a s and haven't yet decided which i am keeping as they both work. i'm 5'4" and 116#. going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall. i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well. have i mentioned i love this dress?
The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"  103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well  but instead of looking slouchy and cool  it just looked too big. so  back it goes.
I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.     it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).
Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.
Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!
I didn't think top was very flattering and  while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.
I purchased this in the green color  and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.
This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but  i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!
What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"  but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me  so i'll be returning it.
I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.
If you're pregnant  congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs  this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d  normally a small or medium  but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me  although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides  it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve  which makes it look wide at the to
Love! i am 5'3" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase
I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank  but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!
Cute  comfy  and would highly recommend them to others. i plan on getting one more color because i feel like i will wear them all the time!
I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.
I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it
I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.
I ordered the taupe version of this tee  which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough  and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit  which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture  i expected an a-line fit  but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes  and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.
I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white  yellow  pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.
I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.
I have these pants in the brown & red colors  and i love them both equally! they are stretchy  and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them  but retain their shape & neatness.
I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on  but when i brought it home  i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!
I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however  if you are chesty  this piece shows off more than i was comfy with  and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body  i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top  the xs showed much too much cleavage.  (34d  5'  115).  i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
I absolutely love this sweater! first of all  it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top  but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length  which i normall
Super soft fabric  however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl  normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it.
Just got this dress in the mail yesterday and i love the style and fabric soooo much!!! the fabric looks kind of shiny in the photos so i wasn't quite sure  however in person it's a perfect blend that can easily be dressed up or down. sadly i cannot fully see how it looks on me because the bust of it is way too small. i normally wear a 0 or 2 in a dress and am a 32c but the inside panel that you cannot see in any of the photos is very fitted to the chest and i cannot even zip the size 2 over my
I have two tracy reese skirts from a few years back that i still wear. so i am favorably disposed to this designer's style and quality. this is a slim fitting skirt  though i ordered it in a 6 and my two others are 8s. so i don't agree with previous review that this skirt runs large. it is nicely fitted and flattering. it does not ride up when sitting  which is almost amazing. i wish the pockets laid a bit flatter. also  on my skirt there is no sewn-in fabric or laundering instructions. none! th
This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere  however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong  or the model in the picture is just very very small. i'm 5'10  136#  36aa  slim built and the dress fits  but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer  bc it is super cute! also  the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!
I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.
This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however  it does have a roomy fit  so you might want to size down. as a petite person  i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall  comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.
Women who want some flutter without too much fullness
This dress is beautiful! runs a little bit large. i usually wear a small or medium. i took the petite small in this dress. i am 5'3" and ordered in petite sizing and i am so glad that i did. the only complaint that i have is that there is no liner and although the dress has some dark colors  it is very sheer  very see through.
I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
I loved this dress and i really loved it more after i bought it on sale. i am 5'3 100lbs and the only thing that bothers me is that the arm of it are somewhat tight when i reach out to get something. other wise the dress is great and get a lot of compliments on it. i paired it with black nylons and black plain leather booties and it looked great!
This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.
Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.
This is a beautiful sweater. the photo doesn't do it justice. the model is wearing too large a size. i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium. the price is too high but the 25% savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain. the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters. the coloring is very flattering and  with care  this should be able to be worn for years. it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes. i wasn' particularly impress
I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo  i knew i had to try it on. once i did  i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.
This top is so pretty in person. it bells out at the bottom just the right amount.
I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before  so i ordered it in a 4p  my usual size  and a 4. i am petite  but the 4 worked perfectly  i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.    the quality is excellent  the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so
It's a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans  if can even be dressed up. however  i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it's a very cute design  it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate  i've gotten many compliments on it! order a size up  i am normally a small but the medium worked be
I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!
I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well  it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design  but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs  32d  5'5".
I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated  it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.
Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large  so i will try a medium.
These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.
Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!
This is a wonderful top. it looks great with jeans and shorts. feminine and clever design. many compliments.
I'm 5'6" about 120 and usually a 0/2 in retailer... the size 2 in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably. on the hanger and from the photo i didn't think i'd like it  but once on it's really pretty and the fabric looks so nice  it has great movement  and is really flattering.
This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.  *highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.
I am always a fan of retailer cardigans  but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art  especially the back and the color  i chose the green  is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed  go for it!
When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however  when i examined it and proceeded to try it on  i was really disappointed. the quality is ok  but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d 109lbs  5'0"). the bottom part fit. sadly  not impressed. this one is going back :(
I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more "denim" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.
I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. i am not a aize 2 (usually a 6) but the dress's a-line shape allowed me to get a size 2. the dress is well made and the orange beaded work is lovely. a very pretty dress that i will wear a lot.
I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews  i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist  it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween.
This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0.
Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide)  but the medium for my height (5'7") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress  i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!
I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it. the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isn't too revealing. the jersey material hangs beautifully. i also appreciate it being lined.
This dress is made of a wonderful  thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck
I am a loyal retailer shopper  but find many items are hit or miss. this definitely is a hit especially in black! i am 5'4" 125 lbs and 36ddd. i usually take a m or m petite in retailer tops. because this is flowy and long  a s petite fits perfectly. the style is one-of-a-kind  the lace is heavy and top quality  and when you try on the right size  it hits perfectly. the lavender is a dusty shade that won't work well in fall/winter. it would look wonderful in cranberry or forest green.
I love the design and color of this cardigan  and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately  it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"  105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties  as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring  but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel
The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it's going back.
I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings  and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin  i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big  the xxs are sold out. typical.
I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print  i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.
This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
I'm a sucker for plaid. i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer  and it looked like a housecoat on me. this is lovely - a bit fitted  but very relaxed and casual. i'll be able to dress it up for casual days at work. it's got enough lovely details to be stylish. i think the waist looks a bit simple  so a belt helps dress it up. the sleeves finish with a button  so it looks polished  or they can be rolled up. i love it with booties!
Lovely  airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online. i am 5'3" and 118lb. i ordered a regular s  and it fits fine. yes  it is midi length  coming to about 3" below my knee. i would have preferred the 39" length if it had been available  but it was not. still  i will compensate by wearing higher heels :-) the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic  and really makes this dress special. the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication. if you want to a
I love the dress overall  however  found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall  a beautiful dress to own.
Not sure why this dress was once backordered? if you have a big chested basically falls from your chest straight down and gives you know figure. disappointing. i will be returning it. not meant for big chested fit woman.
I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.
Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.
I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.
This is a lovely dress that i would consider to purchase if the dress is lined and the key hole is not deep. tts
The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to
This shirt is very flattering on. it's perfect to wear to work and also in a casual setting. it is rather short so it would be best to pair it with high rise pants!
This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely  i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!
This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out! in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store. well  these are described as 'slim  tailored' in details  so decided to order my usual size 6 regular. upon arrival  they were baggy in the thigh area  the rise was fine but the crotch area -pardon me- was a little on the short side. buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole & unbuttoning was a job! guess the hol
I have bought 4 of these  but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag  there are little holes on the front of each  now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase  but the material needs to be better.
I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price  they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim  pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right  and the tag sewn inside  was sewn with red thread and showed through  very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store  but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt  which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt  i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit  i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store  how would th
I just want you guys to be aware that the red print is not short sleeved! we have this in store and both are 3/4 length sleeves! great material and fit.
I tried this shirt in the purple motif  it fit true to size  my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
I purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left. but it fit like a large if not an xlarge! it's a beautifully made sweater and really soft. i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there. it's not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is  it's not that flattering if it's hanging on you. luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that it's bette
These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon)  7% polyester  and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out.   .  these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton  18% modal  2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton  at least in the stevies.  .  i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b
Great  easy to wear wrap dress. rich colors are fabulous for fall. the contrasting knit back adds just the right touch to make the dress more interesting as compared to your typical paisley print dress. i ended up with a petite as the length seemed more flattering and the bust line fit better than the regular.
The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater  but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.
The small is huge on me and the sweater is very itchy. cute idea but not for me. i will return it.
This top is so perfect for the fall... flowy  beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown boots gorgeous! wore it once and got a lot of compliments!  i'm 5'2" 125 and ordered a size 4. 2 worked too but just a tad tight in the arms. :)
I want to love this dress. it's cute and fits well...except that the hem has been taken out! it looks like it had a hem that was removed  and they left the crease remnant and frayed edge. looks very sloppy on the bottom. to keep this dress  i would have to pay a seamstress to hem it  and i don't want to pay extra money for something that should already be done.
Great buy on sale. i wanted a foundation tee to wear under cardigans and it's great for that. perfect length  interesting  textured fabric.  i got the white in a large. fits well. a bit oversized but in a good way. stick to your normal size.
I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be  but overall  it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!!
I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
Very comfy dress that you can wear in the summer if it's not too hot and in the fall/winter with boots (tall or ankle).
I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type  just not mine. i'm 5'5  125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls  very tall girls or curvy on the
I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.
I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.
I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress  but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality  a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through  perfect length  perfect v-neck (no cami required)  amazing colors  perfect shape  not tight (body skimming)  doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color  but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee
I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!
It's cute. it works with jeans  linen pants  flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a "must have". but i'm keeping it because it works!
I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale  i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.
I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but  the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.
This dress is so soft  and fits like a dream. i'm a new mom and the tie perfectly masks what's left of my mummy tummy  while still helping me feel stylish for fall!
Loved the look  fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only  you have to be kidding?
Like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a 32 or 33  possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a 36 c  i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
This blouse is an all season winner.i bought the taupe and can wear it with or without a cami  under a sweater. alone  with skirts  pants  jeans. i am 5'7  135# and a medium was perfect although i normally wear a small.
I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10")  but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.
This is a pretty  yet comfortable dress. perfect to wear to work or out to brunch with the girls.
Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.
I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.
Love this top  wore it for the first time today and it looks so good. soooo flattering from the front. the back is plain  but ive got some back fat  so i wear a jacket.
I wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no  i didn't buy too small  and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
The only reason i gave this top a 4 star  is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup  and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price)  i have no coplaints.  i would recommend.
Ordered size 12  it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long  hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color  nice fabric  great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!
Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment 
I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully
I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c
This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.
This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small  sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25" long instead of the 35" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two.
The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping
I bought the grey  which is a gorgeous color. i like the long length in the arms (though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very). soft and pretty. i like the length. the back does wrinkle  but i still like the shirt. it's loose  casual and flattering.
I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped.   it is very pretty but once on  it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust.   the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.
I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great  but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10  12  and 12 petite. the 10 actually fit  but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however  if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around  these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th
This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual  and probably best used as a beach cover up  as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said  i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing  i usually order a small  and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.
I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though  i thought it flattering enough to keep.
First of all  mine arrived in a regular denim shade  not the dark wash shown. also  the style is more like a blazer  and it was huge. i am 5'2" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well  the sleeves came barely past my wrists  they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person  if you can.
Runs a little big  but cute and comfortable. also shows bra straps a bit on each side  even when i ordered a size smaller. overall  very happy with it.
The first time i wore it  felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size  which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd  around 130 pounds  and 5'5" and a size 6 fits perfectly.
Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf  not cute-short  just off. (i'm 5'8" and 125#) to quote my husband  "nope. not feeling these." that said  they feel great on  seem to be made well  but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)
So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on  all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed  i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  2 buttons popped off!
I absolutely adore this tunic  however  i followed the label and hand washed/hung dry and it shrunk! i was able to exchange it  so i will be taking it to a dry cleaner to see how it needs to be cleaned.  for reference  i purchased a regular xs...i am 5'2"  120 lbs.
I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however  it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale  i may purchase it again  but i did end up returning the shirt.
I just bought this and tried it on on a whim and am so happy i did! it's so much more flattering on than this photo depicts. i think it'll be one of my summer staples this year! give it a try!
I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back  i went with a medium  but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well  so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back  but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
The color of this is beautiful. i'm 5'8" and had to order the s because they were out of the m  so it's not as dramatically long on me as on the model  but otherwise fit - sleeves a little shorter too. the m would have been better. but it is a little scratchy wherever it touches my skin  so it's not worth the $$$ to me. going back :(
This was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping! anyway... this ended up being my favorite item from my order! i love the way it wraps and also lays open. i didn't realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits  but i think it adds nice interest. i ordered the red which is a nice  deep red...not an obnoxious fire engine red. it's very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair. i run between a small and medium  but chose the medium since it looked like it c
Comfortable  relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately
I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable  yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"  125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit  and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend.
This t is a beautiful color  and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy  however - very thin cotton fabric  without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips so instead of covering them  it highlights them. i'm disappointed  and am returning it.
I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to
I wound up returning this shirt  because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall  and long waisted  but slight on top.     the shirt is gorgeous  and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..
This sweater was pretty short. beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.
I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut  but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole
This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me.
I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8"/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.
I'm torn on how to review this dress.     i bought it in a lovely slate grey (which doesn't appear to be available now). it drapes cleanly and is extremely comfortable. it has also proven extremely versatile through weight and body changes. i bought a small and am 5'9"  and am typically ~130 lbs with a very long waist. i wore it through early pregnancy and now love it because i can nurse my newborn comfortably and it still nicely fits my ~150 lb frame.     the problem is that my husband hates th
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
I loved this dress before putting it on  but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
I fell in love with the print  it is much prettier in real life. more teal burgundy on yellow and more vivid than it shows here. the waist elastic is too tight and high for me....would prefer it looser and not on natural waist. but i still bought it and am ordering a second one in hopes that the elastic tightness is varied.
I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell  but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.
I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is  as one of the reviewers said  like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress  and the top lays over it  not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped  size 14  and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.
This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin  and had to return it because of this. otherwise  it would have been a keeper.
I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them
Love the knit  color  texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering.
The fabric felt beautiful  and it felt great on  but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful  but looked like a sack - returned
These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on  but once on  they actually fit perfectly. so  i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115  5'6" and i got the xs.
I had higher hopes for this dress and perhaps should have sized up  but it was not very forgiving in the stomach area on me. i still love the dress and the look of it on the model  but was less than thrilled with it on myself. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  and ordered a size small.
I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.
True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat
I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
Fits great  not too tight/baggy. pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own.
I bought this and like other reviews  agree that the quality probably could be better  but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart  but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled  but the fabric is textured  so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!
The dress is great for pear shapes. however  i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable  not too thick or thin. however  i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.
When i saw that these were on sale  i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately  the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants  i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long  i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however  it was well worth it.
I bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them. i definitely need a 27 (39 inch hips  33 low waist  31 waist). i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants. even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5' 9" frame. they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model. if you are shorter  i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look. the material is not bright white wi
Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.
I love this top! it's classic and classy but with a fun update being a henley. the gingham is super cute  the texture of the fabric is really nice and soft and thick (it is fully lined). i plan to layer it for winter and can't wait to pair it with white capris come spring. i bought my usual size xs and it's a little snug at the hips (where i'm more curvy) but perfect overall. highly recommend!
Picked this up end of season sale  but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto
- this really is lovely. the overall design from the arms  front  and back makes this poncho unique. it's not too thick  either  making it a nice everyday sort of thing. however  it just didn't work for me. even though i'm 5'9"  ponchos have a tendency to
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
This dress didn't work for me for several reasons  but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms  which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.    on the plus side  the fabric feels great  and it hangs well.
I don't know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the "knit" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms!
I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!
I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"  120 lbs and tried a size s.
This sweater is perfect with leggings  crop pants  jeans and wide leg pants. a line  3/4 sleeves  does not cling to waist area... very flattering. so soft   comfortable and thick cotton knit... no cami required. length is bum covering.
I love this dress  is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.
I adore this blouse  but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.
The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.
I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back  since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight  and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable  even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold  i am sick of neon!!!!
Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different 
This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue  and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine  just larger and even more roomy)  but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans  flats  leather boots  o
It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.
This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!  unfortunately  i did have to iron it right out of the bag.
I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11"  slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts. the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the
These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found!! people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand! flattering  comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out! highly recommend!
I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size  matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.
Saw this on line and decided to "splurge" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture  appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed.
This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up  which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom  so i am hoping that they will "draw up" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100  they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t
This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.
Nice fit  stretchy fabric  but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!
Beautiful print. agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size. the dress was a perfect length on me with heels - even after i kicked off my heels i didn't find it too long like other reviewers. wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so it's no longer a true wrap dress
Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching.     i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.
Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish  118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i
Very comfortable shirt  light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!
I am super happy with this purchase. this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow. i'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it  making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather. i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well.
The dress is beautiful  i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully  and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.
I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus  the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.
This is a comfortable cardigan in a versatile color palette. size small fits a little snug in the shoulder area but other wise true to size. fabric is soft. great quality for the price!
I love this top. i wish i had more like this to cycle into my wardrobe
Ordered this top online  as i loved the colors and design  but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m  and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide  not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
I love the design of this tunic. it is sewn well  but the fabric is cheap. i disliked the texture of the fabric so much that i returned it.
I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however  upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
I love this top! fits great n is elegant. great for the workplace n a night out. absolutely beautiful! quality fabric. love love love!
The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult  but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.
I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess  lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors  fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.
I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet  it's almost weightless  which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!
Loved the fit. the size was true and it felt so soft on.
Like the previous reviewer  my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket  this shirt dress is very well made  very cute
Just as nice and comfortable  except this one ahs the bonus of being able to pair wit different tops...too bad i ahve the dress in the same color!    soft  stretchy  stays in place (lining dind't crwal up when walked  but dind't try the petite...#    fit: true to size  if you usually need petites  you will #otherwise it fals in an awkwards pot on your calves#.    my usual xs was comfrtable and flattering  not clingy. i would get it if i dind't have hte dress# plus of dress is i don't have to thi
I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite  but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated  and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31" from the shoulder seam to the hem  not 36" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely  but i just can't
This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.
So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
I found this dress to be very short waisted  much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9" tall)  32d chest. i liked it  it was comfortable  but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end  i d
Some quick notes- it is not sheer  like a previous poster was asking. there is a lining. the color is darker than it appears online  which was ok with me. i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold. i was excited about this top  and thought it was the perfect thing for a casual/festive company holiday party. i ordered a m  and am usually between m and s in most retailer items. unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short. i have a larger bust (30g) and it draped in a very unflattering way. m
I love the design of this blouse and the pattern  but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :(   it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.
Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso  so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print  it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic  girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short  just right. i took a medium  i am 5'8" and athletic.
I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them.   im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight.     the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.
Very flattering. i am 36c and short torso and the small fit like a glove . the medium was a bit loose and gapped some on the side of my breasts. need to wear strapless bra. really cute style and goes with several of the patterned capri pants i bought at retailer this spring !!
I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been
I skipped over these when they first cme in store  but it was reccomended to me to try them on. so i did  and i loved them  they look like a skirt which is amazing but you won't be worrying on those breezy days ;) they run very big!!!! i'm usually a 26/27 or 2/4 in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but that's the smallest size carried in store. i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant. if you are interested i
Adorable top  but it runs very small. i usually take a 4  but thought it may shrink up so i ordered a 6. it was a bit tight through the bust (34a)  so i sent it back for an 8.
I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
This is a lovely dress  with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however  it runs small in the waist  if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
I am 5'9" and 138 pounds slender  but with a tummy. the small fit great  and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary. the dress flounces out a little  but in a cute way  and it's not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now. i didn't think it looked that great on the hanger  but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected. got the brown. thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie  boot  moto jacket transition to
I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily. i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland  i don't think i lost even one of them. this dress is super fancy but very comfy.
I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past  and i've never been disappointed with quality  style  or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering. i got these in a 4  my usual size  and the fit is perfect. i also got these in the regular  rather than petite  but the length works just fine for my height. i bought these in the grey stripe  but like them so much i think i'll order another pair in the orange.
Just got this in - love the color and fabric  but it has no shape on me. i thought i'd wear a large because i have a 36ddd chest  but i should have gotten a medium  at the largest. also  even if it did fit  it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front. i'll be returning.
I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back
It's a unique piece and feels very comfy for casual wear - lots of compliments.
I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern  but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer  but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o
Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
Love this skirt. super soft and flowy. the red color is beautiful. i love the detailed raunching for the waist band. the length is perfect at my knee is i wear it empire waist style or below my knees if i wear on my hips.
This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater  and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.    zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top  but overall i'm really happy with this dress!
I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.
This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r
I have been looking for the perfect jumpsuit and this is it! i am 5'7.5" and 122 lbs and the small is a perfect fit! the fabric is super comfy  you can wear a regular bra (yay!) and it can be dressed up or down! i am looking forward to taking this on my european vacation in august! the blue is a very pretty blue but i opted for the black!
I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears
Love this skirt length and the detail buttons. also great give to the jean fabric. looks great on and runs true to size.
First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said  i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to  dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap  paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well   i received it in the mail   and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art  as i see it as an exp
Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don't you dare lift your arms. i'm kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe?
I really loved this top. however  i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad  i really wanted this look.
This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer  but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does  however  look great with skinny jeans.
I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m  and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column  i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it  but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing  and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
I just received this in the mail today! fabric and construction are beautiful and high quality. my only concern was that it ran short on me all around. i am 5'2  100lbs  32b  24 waist  33 hips. the dress was an appropriate length all around but ran very short in the arm holes  the back cut-out  and the waist. i felt like i was trying to wear a little-girl's dress (and i tend to be short waisted and long-legged as is). i may exchange it for a regular size because it is such a beautiful dress!
Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different. the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side. i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured. for that reason  i'm on the fence about keeping them. i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out.
I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.
I ordered these jsut coz they were on sale... i now wish my size was offered in more colors. (only mossy-sage was left  though nice neutral color  really0.    the fit is great  stretchy but stil lslightly structured. i ordered the 25p and that was perfect  length fine too (i am 5'1.5"  115 lbs).    looked really nice with a pair of red heel i was trying on too!
I bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows. the color is definitely one you don't see a lot of  which is what makes it special. i could see it running a tad large  but i think it's pretty true to size. now i'm debating about buying it in blush!
Cute design and interesting back feature. runs a little big and is comfortable and flowy.
Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.
Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution
I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2"  115lbs  32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it  o well.
I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews  but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures. i don't love the color but decided to try them on anyway since i've never tried ag before. well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great! i didn't want to take them off  so i ended up keeping them. now ag is my favorite brand for jeans!
This tunic is a casual  comfy yet stylish piece that is a great addition to my wardrobe. the only thing i find might be an issue is the thin material. i tried wearing a tank top under it but the material is too thin and the outline of the tank was too noticeable and looked odd. removed the tank and all was good! pairs great with leggings
I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style  fit  and fabric. an eternal fan of ag  i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up  dressed them down  and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.
Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!
It runs big though! definitely order a size smaller  the underneath slip is stretchy which is great  but the lace outer shell runs big!
Love the look. love the fit for both professional and casual looks!!
I really  really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however  it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress  i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.
Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one i've found what doesn't make me look like a bear. the shoulder cut-outs really help create a   flattering silhouette. i'm 36-30-40 the medium fits well  slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly. highly recommend.
I almost didn't try this dress. i walked by it a few times and am so glad i gave it a try! the fit is amazing. so flattering. the color and material for fall is perfect. it looks great with booties and heels.
What a cute shirt! i got the red and white and it's definitely a summer shirt although i'm sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan. i'm a 10 m and the m fit well. tts.
I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline  i think  creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that  the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back  especially at the sale price.
These are a great casual pants with a lot of style. my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs. i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit  there is at least an inch difference please see photos. i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s.    who is making these pants? can't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa
I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup  so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love
I love the cold shoulder trend  and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue  which is really more like a very light mint green. however  i think the material is pretty thin (though soft)  and the keyhole sleeve area  right by the twist  is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small  but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds  32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price  thou
I bought this tee for the cute print. otherwise  this tee is nothing special. i usually wear an xs  but bought an xxs  based on how loose the tee looks on the model. it's pretty thin and more like a slub cotton. i think i will hand wash it  just in case.
This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.
This is a gorgeous blouse!  the quality is exceptional- beautiful  soft silk. the pattern is lovely  the shape and design is spot on!!  finally!  a lovely tie neck blouse that fits well and is made well. i'm a busty mama and my the size 2 fits perfectly. thank you retailerpolgie for a gorgeous piece of clothing!
The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10" and ordered a medium. also  it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.
This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted  but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white  black  pink  light green  gray  slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark  you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...  i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr
Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item
Very pretty dress but the fit is not great. i have to get help to take it off because it's tight in the shoulders.
I was worried the green might be on the shiny side  but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops  this top runs small  so order up a size. in most of retailer tops  i'm a small or medium  but in this  i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side  but got on sale  so all smiles here.
I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
This shirt is comfortable and looks just like the picture. my only complaint is that it is quite boxy so not very flattering. the colors and details are great. the material is good quality and thick. if you are looking for a light t-shirt this is not for you
So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however  on me  they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus  back they went. for reference  i am 5'5" and 125# and ordered the 6.
$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money  but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side  but very flattering. plus  the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front  but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b
This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy  cozy  but still stylish. i love it.
I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric  like the main photo shown  you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.
This is a really flattering tee for my curves. pretty lace details. i purchased the gray and ordered the wine. the pink looked more peach to me in the store. only reason for 4 stars is that the back material wrinkles easily. true to size (large) for me.
The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture  it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans  or dressing down something fancier.
This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog  but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big  it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
If you're very small-framed and/or petite  i would size down in this. unless you want a really slouchy look and fit.   ----------  i have very broad shoulders and very large biceps  and typically wear a m/l in retailer tops. sometimes if a top is a pullover style (as opposed to button-down) i have to size up to a 12 to get the top to accommodate my shoulder width and biceps. so i was leery the size 8/italian 44 would fit  but it does  with room to spare  albeit it is not as loose or long in the ar
The quality of the fabric these are made from is wonderful- they are soft yet structured and i was so bummed they didn't fit me. i usually wear a size 28 in premium denim so i ordered a 28 and i could barely pull these up over my hips. once i pulled them on i was about 1-2 inches from being able to zip them closed. the pants fit in the legs but they were very close-fitting  which is not the look i'm going for. i am 5'5" and was worried they would look too long since usually pants are for me  but
I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life
I bought this when it first came back a number of years ago and loved it because it is great for travel! it actually can be kind of a blanket when you are on airplanes that tend to be cold and it is so hard now to get a blanket. it is also great coat for me as i live in southern california and it is not too heavy but does help the evening chill. i went on a trip with this a few months after i originally bought it and i accidentally lef at the hotel i was staying at. i am so glad it is back so th
This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!
Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress  or as tunic over the pants.
This top fits tts. the sweater part is cream  eyelet material is white. love it!
I love the style  but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26  and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant  i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2  and 110 lbs. unfortunately  i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom  i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake  not sure if it's real leather.
It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching  adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful  i am 5'7"  133  and a 36a.   if you have been considering this dress  don't delay  especially at the wonderful sale price!
After readying the reviews of this dress  i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy  was i wrong! first  this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall  the entire dress was not flattering. honestly  i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt  it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy  marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer  requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way  unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally  the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh
Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.
I ordered this and didn't even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just wasn't what i was looking for as far as color. also  the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well  thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a
This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering  you can wear a normal bra with it (for me  very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily.     i am 5 foot 1  123  and curvy on top and ordered a small petite. in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs  but in this one the small felt the best -- more comfortable around the waist.     will get tons of wear out of this -- have already taken it on a trip and wo
I absolutely love this tunic and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in the mail. i thought it looked really cute in the photo here  but it's even better in person and is extremely flattering on. so happy.
Comfortable and soft material  cute design and nice longer length..however  i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me  elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
The dress looks great both in winter and summer  either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.  the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste  but i still love the dress.
There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt  but thought ti wasn't special enough  don't get me wrong  it fits nicely  and is comfortable  but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly  26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt  the sale price is a good fir for the skirt  just wasn't enough for me :-)
I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.
I really want to love this shirt  but the small is just way too big on me. for reference  i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small)  5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
These pants are uh-mazing!! i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg. i didn't notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a+. way to go! these are my new favorite pants...i wish pilcro would make this style in more colors  and fabrics.     i wear a 25p or a 24p and i'm glad i got the 25p because it's true these are tight in the leg but i think that's a good thing since cords look awful when the
I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!
Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove  very flattering.& got lots of compliments.  i am 5'4" and 125 lbs  i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)
I originally ordered the white in this cami  but after receiving was absolutely obsessed with it! i ordered the 2 other colors. the fabric is so soft and the buttons are perfect as i just had a baby and will need easy access for nursing. love this cami!
I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!
I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks. it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly  the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.
I tried on the xs petite  and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big  you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also  the material is soft but thin (see through  somewhat). the xs petite  just seemed big overall  i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs  30dd for reference.
Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all  it's not a happy orange  it a darker rust.  second  it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.
I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great.   the first time i pulled it out at home  i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side  the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for
I love this dress but the zipper is definitely defective.  its a flatering style and i love the fabric and fit. im normally a 10 but the 8 fit perfectly.     i'm nervous to wear it because of the zipper. i would return it but dont have the receipt.
It was a little on the thinner side (fabric)  a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back  i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable  and the back is beautiful (love bows)  tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price  even on sale  i didn't feel i absolutely needed it  but if you are looking for a hite tank  it is pretty cute. (ivory  not pure white).    xs: 115 lbs  60 dd.
Pilcro denim with embellishment like this always wins me over. these pair of jeans fit well  the detail is so pretty for fall. cant wait until it cools off to wear these. the price point is a little high considering the silly shipping costs too. love the jeans though.
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
The pants are pretty and run true to size  but the fabric is bathing suit like  very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
I have many sweaters but i bought this during the sale and it is very soft and comfortable.
This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.  i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.  with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side  all this make it to accumulate the "extra" weight on the front of the body and as result "not flattering" for the majority of ladies including me  it is a shame since it has may great features  the style: flowy  low
I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also  the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol
Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.
I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time
This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
Beautiful dress.  the  printed material under the tulle however hung 3 inches lower than the tulle skirt. i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of  tulle skirt because it looked awkward. even after paying full price for the dress i didn't mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful.
Beautiful design and soft  warm wool. warm enough to have on outside in the fall (i live in pdx)  and also stylish enough to keep on inside. buy the right size (not too big) because it's meant to fit on the waist and the skirt swings out from there!
I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes  paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy!   it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3" - not so good - had to return  sadly.
This is a beautiful skirt. it is exactly as pictured. the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected. i feel like it does run a bit small. i'm usually an 8 in skirts and dresses and bought a 10. it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now. my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement. anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away. the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well. i do
I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to "pull up" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#
I love this little topper. it is very comfortable. it looks elegant.
Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
Ordered online  and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9  130. the embroidery is lovely  but the style doesn't work. i had a small  but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame  but i do caution how "voluminous" the cut
This jumpsuit is very comfortable. the material is soft the waist is elasticised  it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos.
The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big  it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics  not sure if it is because it's new.
I was so excited about this top  super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold  hand wash  air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large  as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite  but this one is a return.
I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.
So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
Very comfortable. love the built-in lining. it fits loosely  but i don't like anything binding so it works for me. length is fine  i could easily wear it to work.
This has great drape  length  the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck  so not sure if i will keep  though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight  boiled wool texture  contrasting print and design so cool!
I bought this in a large  i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
I added this to a stack of try-ons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on. 148 dollars is a little pricey but didn't hesitate it was so beautiful  i am a 32b and normally wear a size 6 and the small fit perfectly. can't wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks!
Super thick material and it's lined with cotton so as not to be scratchy on the skin. it looks cute on  hopefully it will soften over time. almost thick like upholstery fabric.
I ordered this in the blue  it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back  but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top  but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted  34-d  5'3  125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.
This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust  shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top
This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses  so that may influence my enthusiasm. however  once i buttoned it up  it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs  so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height  but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress  it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti
This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit  flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing. i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter. my only complaint is that the sweater was pilling/shedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it. i hope that that doesn't happen every time that i wear it. i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing.
As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.
I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color  but it was just unflattering on me.
Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall  at church  and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!
Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.    only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist  but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop  as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist.
Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
Just got this skirt in the mail and i am so happy i took a chance and ordered it! my waist is a lot smaller than my hips so skirts can be a challenge! but this one fit me perfectly! it is casual but i can also see myself wearing this to work in the summer months. it is super flattering and very comfortable! the fabric is soft and it does have some give. i am usually a size 30 in pilcro chinos and the size 10 in this skirt fit me perfectly. so i would say it runs true to size. a great addition to
It's beautiful  but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.
This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable  and flattering even though it's not tight fitting. true to size as well.
This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite  but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute  and versatile dress that
This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(
The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours)  but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however  they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on  which i liked.
A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!
The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.
Quality assembled;comfortable and stylish with 2-tone fabric; wash w/o shrinkage;pair with every rainbow color. nice alternative to jean days.
These are my favorite jeans. the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them. all the details reflect a high quality jean. i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist. these sit lower on my hips  no gap  and plenty of space for my butt. they do run a bit large though. i have a 29" natural waist and think a 28 would have been even more perfect.
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing. i am 5'6" 130 and athletic build  it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model. i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt.
Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy  the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.
Really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !
They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously isn't the ideal fit but it will manage. it's very cute  but the colors aren't as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.
I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
I absolutely love this sweater. it's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely. it's definitely more cropped (i'm 5'7)  but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt.     so cozy!
I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs  muscular and petite  so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect  i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined  which i think most dresses and skirts should be  so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides  to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline  so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model 
These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 32 in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing
The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo  my measurements are 38-30-40.
The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.
This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
Gave this to a friend as a gift.  soft  lovely.  she loves it.
I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on  i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering  comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.
I want to say that i love this fabric design  combining some of my favorite colors -- greens and neutrals. however  this just didn't work for me:  _______  pros:  - it does have a nice flow as others stated.  - pockets are a surprise touch for a silk dress.  - the slip inside is detachable.  _______  cons:  - as another stated  lots of wrinkles. it's the nature of silk unfortunately  which means more work for me.   - length is too short in front for my personal liking. trend of these high-low he
Love the bright color of this dress for spring and the loose fit and light material are very comfortable.
Retailer  take me away! this dress transports me to an island. i ordered a small and exchanged for an xs  i could have probably even done an xxs (thank you vanity sizing). i'm not tiny. i'm 5'4'' and 130lbs with lots of baby left overs.   i love the details of the dress and so many people stopped me to compliment it. and  while a few people thought i was pregnant while wearing this dress (because women obviously only wear flowy dresses when they're pregnant)  i welcomed the seat offers with wide o
Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.   i'm 5'7" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference.     retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.
Love this top  flattering on my post baby body. its feminine and soft
This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.
Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise  it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly  i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers  it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul
Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them  but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!
Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small
There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too  but even this color turned me off.
This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit. i am petite  so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me  but it actually makes me look slim and taller. i get so many compliments when i wear it. i ordered the xxs petite.
...for real  reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.
The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway  i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
This dress is very pretty colorwise  but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips  but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
I am 5' 7" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute  you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit.
I was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!
So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!
I absolutely adore this dress! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress. it's effortless  yet still a showstopper. i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me. it's not too tight in the ribcage  yet it is slimming and flattering. not matronly at all! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look  or worn untied for a breezy  casual  a bit more sexy look. i will be wearing this dress
Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum  the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.
Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy  so the 0 fit perfectly.
I love this top! although  i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4"  138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home.
Very cute and comfortable!does run big  i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.
True to form  this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight  stylish  great for a shorter person like myself  and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long  but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater  too  but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one 
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!
When i first saw this in the retailer catalog  i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints  and unique color combinations  both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"  120 lbs and a small bust at 32b  i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality  i definitely recommend it if your shape is s
Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one  so i ordered down. it can go either way  it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.
It actually is a pretty good t-shirt  but i wish that i had known that "white" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like.
Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath  but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad  just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic  but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms  but apparently i don't.
So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso  wear a small 34c  and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky  it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out. the constr
I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"  medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal
I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very  very rarely a size 0  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose  flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however  the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.    i do really like the styling and quality  so i am planning on
I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest  as the waist hits a bit high.  the color is vibrant...i wanted to like!
The print is beautiful  the fabric has a nice weight. i actually bought this because i'm early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period - because of its swing shape  this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in 6 months when i've got a huge belly.    fit-wise: i am 5'9  155 lbs  34d  and ordered a large  but i am exchanging it for a medium. the arm holes are also a bit large.
I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine  the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.
Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.
This is a very comfortable shirt    great basic to have in the wardrobe    it runs a little high on the sides
I wanted to love this dress  however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through  so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.
I wasn't sure about this shirt at first glance  it's difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics  with the top having a much looser weave. however  it looks great on. the blue color is very saturated and pretty. the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable. and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame. i'm pretty busty  36dd i think....i usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless they'r
I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??
If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front  not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.
I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!
I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans  and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like  but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer  i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.
Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.
Had to send back for exchange. way too big. i'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made.
Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah! no seriously  it's like a 10-yr old tee soft! the colors aren't even close compared to online  though. the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color. i didn't see the lilac in the store.
I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.
This top fits nicely  lays nicely  and washed nicely! i purchased the same shirt in other colors because it was such a great purchase! i am short and it was not too long and not clingy.
This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it "special" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.
I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3  123 lbs.  34-d. it's going back.
The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2"  115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn't hot for summer.  got the regular si
Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
These are great for summer except you need to size down! unless the pair i received was an anomaly  these run very large!
I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight  very nice cotton  i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3"  133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress.
I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.
I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey  which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!
I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
Beautifully made  gorgeous colors. i wanted to love this  but it just wasn't flattering - too "a" shaped  not enough drape to flatter.
I liked this blouse very much the minute i first seen it  it looks exactly as pictured but sits much better in person. i'm 6ft tall 160lb ordered a 10 which was true to size with a little more room to the bottom. i was able to see my belly button through the sheer part of the bottom fabric  but as soon as i sucked my belly in  it was fine. the quality of the fabric is so-so i had some threads hanging out here and there  but this top looks very good in person and the design is unique  you can hav
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.
This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!
I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.
Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa
Purchased this dress at the sale price  with an additional 20% off sale  not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference  i'm 5'4  132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish  yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.
Have had many compliments on this tee! feels dressed up without feeling too fancy
Like the other reviewers said  it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!
This top is very pretty  but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy)  but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"  125lbs  34b. i preferred the regular length  but if you like your tops to end at your waistband  then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top  so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.
I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.
Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus
I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model. this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases. the cut is very flattering. i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top  the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out. i'm a pear-shape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips  but it all flows really nicely. the arms aren't tight. they're not loose but aren't too poofy.  the material washed well too  without static (a pro
Loved the sweater and the sale price was great  but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time  my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes  i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful  well-fitting  and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly  but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.
This dress is really pretty  but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also  the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally  if one was to wear it a lot  the felting might start to fray.
I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.
I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck  fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small  not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical 
This dress is flattering in so many ways. fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips. sizing is perfect. i also bought it in the navy/black color. you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops.
I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
This is even nicer in person than it is online. i absolutely love it. i am 5' 5" and 128 lbs. and ordered my usual size small. i probably could have worn an extra small  but don't feel like the small is too big. this could be my favorite purchase of the season.
Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store  and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.
I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality  thick enough to feel appropriately covered  and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!
I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.
I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle  but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined  but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2" and usually purchase the petite  but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.
In truth  it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however  i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.
This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down  it's a staple in my summer wardrobe.
I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the "gold" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s
Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...
The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though  because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall  very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.
I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!
This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy  however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too "blousy." highly recommend this-
I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!
This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also  the colors in t
I was so excited to wear this shirt  even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot  and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.
I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does  so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider  especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure
I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now  so i can't even reorder. bummer.
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
I fell in love with this piece when i saw it in store a few months ago. when there was 25% off dresses  i decided to pull the trigger and ordered it online. since i didn't try it on back then  i ordered my usual petite size 10  but found it to be too big. it's too bad i had to return it because it's a beautifully designed dress. i like the neckline  rouching on the side of the bodice  the lining and slim silhouette. the dress is very stretchy. i found that i could take big strides comfortably in
I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute  the "swing" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops  but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent.
I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up  you'll love it...
About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing
Got this in the red  like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug.  you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit.    other than that  super comfortable and soft fabric
I have to say being a silk lover  decision was hard to make. the quality is phenomenal. i do agree to a reviewer that said it's pj like. i tried it with belt  didn't help much with the look somehow. it just felt empty. my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said "ewww  grandma"... i know  truth hurts.    i can't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement. on top of that  the background is more peachy tha
I had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online. however  it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris. for the price  the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.
Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.
This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said  "meh " so back it went.
I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input  i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute  but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.
I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack  in a moss green color. the material  cut  and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26  and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items  they cost $42 + tax.
Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!
This shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent. this shirt runs ridiculously large. purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl. no impressed with the pattern in person. looks cheap. will be returning.
This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.
This is a great  versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering  and the material is soft and lightweight. this  like many retailer tops  runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium  and although i liked the way the tee hung  it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store  so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely  and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)
I love how soft  and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.
I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.
Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top  it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me.
I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff  plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots  but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan  so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the "slim fit " i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it  i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad  just weird)  and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it  but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!
I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2  i need things that are cute  but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined  breezy linen fabric  machine-washable  and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders  but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give  so if you are large in the chest  my guess would be a possi
The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.
I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering  they are a perfect long length  and the colors are stunning. after several wears  it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session  i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri
This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.
I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the "orange" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure
I sized down from a 27 p to a 26 p because i like a less loose fit. if you want a slight baggy look then go with your usual size. i love the style  contrasting hem color and slight distressing look. great for end of summer into fall!
I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed! i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent. i have a rather big chest (36dd) and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me. look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!
While this top is pretty  it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad  because i really wanted to like it.
I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen  i usually don't like linen much  it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.
After reading the reviews  i was a little afraid of the fit before the dress arrived  having ordered it online. it is a darling dress. i am big busted (36d) and it fit just fine. also  it has an cute attached slip  so i didn't find it see through. the color is gorgeous  i chose the blue  and it will be perfect for summer. no problem at all with the armholes!
Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.
The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty  though
-this was actually at my local retailer store. it reminded me of another online exclusive that was a dress and had the same flower shapes but the color was a soft pink; this is exactly like that. _____________ pros: - it is so lovely with the pleated front
Love! the perfect go-to black legging! i bought two pair! comfy waist band/not too tight  no muffin top! you won't be disappointed. buy them!
Gorgeous colors  high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug  or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy  but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.
As much as i had wanted this to work for me  it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
I love this tshirt  but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color.
I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.
This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white  which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color  but i returned it since it was nothing special.
I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line "princess" seams in the front and back  but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.
C'mon. the accent is wrong! a simple google search would prevent this.
I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice  just too much fabric for me. returning!
The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.
I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
I usually wear size 4 for dress  but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size 0  and it fits perfectly. well made  maybe a bit stiff around armholes  nothing major. i love the length as i don't like to show my knees. great color combinations  although this supposed to be a summer dress  it looks great for fall  just need to add a jacket  a pair of boots and i'm good to go  feeling pretty!
This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also  it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend
Dolan is my go to for comfy  pretty  practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color  but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
Great trouser pants for summer with pretty jacquard print and neat denim detail at hem and waist band. usually wear a 6 in retailer but went up a size to 8 with these for looser trouser fit. fits my backend nicely which is always a plus. can't wait to wear them!
This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous  classy  comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect "10"!
Well  i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes  it does hide any flaws in the tummy  but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft  2 inches  broad shouldered  36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty  looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only
Ordered this in the orange (black  white and turquoise) print in both a small and medium. the style is cute and i like the high neckline that shows off the shoulders and swing skirt that falls beautifully and hides a multitude of figure problems. :) i also previously bought the emerson swing dress  which is the same style by maeve. the emerson style ran a bit larger and as the reviews there state  the armholes were a bit long - so i ended up with a small in that one. this lilt swing dress  howev
I just received the top today  and will send back for a larger size. i am i between a 4 and 6  so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy. it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders. i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger. the shirt also had a slight musty odor. it's a rather thin chambray....with 3/4 sleeves. the top came to just the top of my jeans  which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering.
This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c
I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter  it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again  i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also  i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable  but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
This t-shirt is perfect for summer. light  breezy & easy. i'm 5'4.5"  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. the front and the arms fit like a t-shirt  which means it looks busty for me. but that's how t-shirts always are for me. the back has something extra and that's the reason i'm keeping it.
I love these sleep pants they are the perfect length. i'  am 5'10 and slim these fit great  its so hard to find pants that fit tall slender women.
I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference  i am 5'7" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way  but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise  it's a great  casual piece. the material is light and soft  and it's cute over leggings.
Super cute  soft  and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat  so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.
I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going  but it was not  it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference  i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me  not "cool" long like some other sweaters this season.
As the other reviewer said  this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer  and i am short... i tried on xxs regular  xs petite and xs regular.    xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders  cehst)  but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular  a bit longer  but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this  but probably something beter wil lcome along.    great for those who want to show their assets
I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i'm bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i'm 5'5" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips  the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it.
Ugh  i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique  but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling  the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
I love the cut of this top  it flares out nicely  and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail  not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice  i didn't try petite or xxs  just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good. (115 lbs  30dd chest)
This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big  especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint
My daughter got this dress in the 10 and i got it in the 6 - we are both tall. also  she's a redhead and got the butterfly version and i'm blonde and got the pink. also  both of us are small-chested - and since there is no give in the fabric  i don't know where one would fit boobs if you have them. one thing i noted (and i am not happy about) is that the back is puckered up along the zipper. this has to be on purpose  and i don't really understand that detail  as it doesn't flatter me and it loo
I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it  according to the directions on the tag  it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight  and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store  but in any case  i cannot wear it again.
Fell in love at first site  cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure.
I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!
It's a very light material  so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket  has no zipper or buttons though  so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!
Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.    wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
I tried on this top in the store in a large and the arm holes were too big. i am busty and usually wear a size 10  so i usually need a m to l. i ordered a m which was shipped to my home  and it fit perfectly. really cute with skinny jeans!
I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on  good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me.
These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light  pretty summer topper...
The material  deep color and design are gorgeous. however  the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p  and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.
I never write reviews  but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it's not a have to have top just to look at it  but once i put it on i had to have it. it's extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together.     i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a
Cute and great fitting pant. love the pattern and it fit tts for the brand. i normally wear a 10/12 and i took at 12. flattering.
This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything  it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward  so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath  go up a size.
I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's
This top had potential  but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"  135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy  but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves  but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute  but thi
Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.
This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking  light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge  the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck  you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it  but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!
I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.    i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p
I have several pilcro jeans in a size 26 that fit great but these ended up being just a little bit too tight in the thigh area to make the style of the jeans looks right. going to return for a larger size. nice material though!
Great sweater. long and warm  but not too thick. i am 5'4" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely.
Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all  then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite  great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
This skirt is a show piece! the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering for different body types. i got my usual size  even though i have a smaller waist and larger hips and thighs. the skirt looks cute with the split-back buttondown by cloth and stone. you will not regret buying this piece!
I tried the 4 and felt it ran a bit big  i'm 34a-28-26  5'6" about 130lbs and expected to take a 6. the 4 was ideal.  love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray  like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo).  it has a trapeze shape  i wouldn't plan on tucking it in.  finally  you mightn't want to
Amazing! they are like those cozy  wool socks. they are true to size. they don't stretch out (at least yet)  even after i stretched  etc . i am going to get another pair since i envision wearing these often in the cold house.
Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner
It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape  but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect.
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned  it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.
I followed everyone's advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 32 inch waist  but size 10's (and 30's in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 12 in this skirt  and it fits perfect. it's form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out  but i'm curvy. if you are straighter  it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf  so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5" tall. the fabric is soft  but has no stretch. it's 100% cotton. there is a
This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.
Lovely print and colors. interior lining was so super soft  but it did lay right on me  felt very big and bulkly and i wasn't a fan of the single snap closure  esp being so low  so i decided it was not for me at that price and returned. 5'5"  135lbs  34c and the s was too big. it is beautiful and i will consider the xs if the price is cut further.
I love this item! . they hang & flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt.  the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!  somewhat transparent i topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty... but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to. (like the model)  heads turned as i walked by!
I ordered these with high hopes. i have 2 other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore. i was disappointed. the fabric isn't soft as i expected. the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band  but this might be due to folding while packaged. i tried these on several times - wanting to like them but just couldn't. i am returning them. the colors are beautiful - especially the bands on the bottom. they seem made well. it might just be that i am between sizes. i am 5'4"  115. i tri
I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me  overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference  5'2  24 waist  30  and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit  i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing  given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
I ordered this sweater in green  and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length  nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however  it was just so  so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8" and 118 lbs  fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored  since i've had a hard time find
I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.
I feel that for this price  i should love this top (and i wanted to). however  the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top  and there were a few things about it that could be improved.  pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally  the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and  generally speaking  has a nice pattern. overall  it's a very pretty top.  cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
I really wanted to not like the top for that price  but ti looks really good  the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p  not sure what size to get  and it is just fine. the length is almost too short  but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide  like poofing out a bit  perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer  but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also  teh colla
The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though  and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.
The colors on this sweater are cute  the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.
I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.
The top is nice  good quality  etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.
I cannot speak more highly of these jeans! i am a standard size 2  5'3" and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away. i *always* have to hem them by massive amounts. these jeans are so flattering  the wash is amazing. i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far  but i think the possibilities are endless. i am petite but in a curvy way and i haven't felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long. the wash is great for dress up/dress down. i have
Beautiful sweater  perfect length  surprisingly warm
Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!
Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price  but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!
I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!
I bought this dress in the blue print and love it! the drape is lovely and its not too short. i feel like it can be dressed up or down. i plan to wear it to a wedding at the end of the month. for reference  my measurements are 36-27-38 (chest 36d and height 5'4) and i ordered the small. i'm usually a small-medium but went with a small based on other reviews. i have a short torso as well and i feel this dress fits perfectly  not too small or too large. as other reviewers stated  there is no linin
Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable  soft  stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.
While i wanted to love this dress  i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk  would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.
Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes!
I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
I'm petite  short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates).     unfortunately  the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise  however  it would have been too long for my torso  which i run into a lot.     too bad.
Great basic item. can be worn with leggings or pants  dressed up or down  or layered on. fit and color are true to size and picture.
I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!
Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants  and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model  so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3  110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!
Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it  like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference  she's 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.
I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater  more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute  warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d  31 waist  38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said  even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first  it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back  get all four panels even  tied  hiding my bra  etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga  i may not have managed. once on  the style looked great. as
I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was  at least for me  a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude  there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down  it is extremely apparent. i am 5"6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me  but again  i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle  it wouldn't ride up and look more fl
I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape  and is very comfortable. however  it's plain  and for the price and it being dry clean only  i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite  but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).
I should have exchanged it for a smaller size  but i wanted to wear it  so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14  and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this  size down for sure.
For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this  especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs  and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small  so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work  because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi
I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted "just another cover-up". in the final analysis  even at $35 (30% off 49.99)  it just hung there. if that's what you're after  then this is for you.
Product is sheer  but definitely adorable w/ any jean product! wouldn't pay full price but so glad i got it on sale w/ extra savings!!!
I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through  so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.
This is all around  a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least)  but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs  but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.
Not what i was expecting  but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser  but these are closer to leggings  albeit very substantial ones with "real pant" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting  soft yet supportive  stretchy  incredibly comfortable  and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31)  and the 10's near perfect  with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available.
Look closely and you will be surprised at this awesome print!  the shirt is very soft and comfy.  be warned that it runs huge.  i usually wear a medium or large in this brand.  after many tries  i ended up with a small and it is roomy.  this looks so cute under a jacket too.
Love this  it's a great update your basic tee!
I love this skirt for so many reasons!   one  it isn't a circle skirt  per se  which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt  the description states that it's a-line. based on that  i was willing to risk it. also  i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.
The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.
I ordered this in black and loved it so much  i ordered the 'red' color too. it hasn't arrived yet  but i'm hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5'3" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and wasn't too long.
I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6"  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)
This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.
Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.
Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only  but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2  32c  107 lb and the xs petite fit very well  definitely form-fitting  not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look  actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest  and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
I love this sweater! i have gotten so many compliments. it is so comfortable and unique. i am planning on ordering the same sweater in another color. i wear a small and ordered a small. it fit me perfectly. i shop at retailer for a lot of my clothes because they are well made and different.
Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs  purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!
Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
Love the coral color of this shirt. only wish it was a little longer in the front. falls right to my jeans waistline.
All t-la's are great. but this one style is my fave. very comfortable  chic  and washes well! i got the grey  but i'm back to get more colors!
A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.
I normally wear 0 in retailer dresses. the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small. i bought a 2 and love it. i plan to wear it to a wedding.
I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.
Gorgeous embroidery  soft fabric  great drape  hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.
This dress intrigued me a bit online  but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack  i wasn't so sure about it  but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh  flattering  flowy  light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric  the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist  but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great
This dress us high quality and feels great  however i am 5'5" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it  not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!
I like the color blocking of this top  but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.
It was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it.
I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it's very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.
I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style  i felt it was too "little house on the prairie". pretty but not the look i was going for.
I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.
I bought this in both yellow and green. what a gorgeous and flatttering top that fits beautifully. i love this top!
I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests wraps shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.
This top isn't straight as it would seem on the "tucked-in" picture on the model. colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson. fabric si very soft. i tried on the 0 but am wondering about trying on 00 or petite size...which i would have to order  so will wait a bit on this one.
I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.
I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.
I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length  but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless  billowy and wide  which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment  by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward  but i decided to return the dress.
I love vests and this is a great one  warm and cute!! because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull  but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have!
Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.
This a beatifully made top - it does run large so i sized down. it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did - i've had many compliments! have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well - it's convertible!
Soft cotton front  slightly more coarse back. shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out. bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well. could also imagine with skinny jeans. normally wear a s  ordered an xs.
I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.
This blouse is very pretty  but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it  or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.
So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year  i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!
Just received these pants today and i absolutely love them! the material is super soft and the fit is true to size! i ordered the tan color. i really like the wide leg and the frayed bottom!! i may order the gray too!
Every time i turned around received another complement! it was perfect for a december wedding  great for a holiday party  and fit the bill for christmas eve. very comfortable and slimming. i'm still amazed at the number of complements received! the navy blue lace is elegant and comfortable  not scratchy like some lace. the "v" in back of the jumpsuit makes it easy to zip and unzip  i have some some imitations and thought i might have a problem zipping up the jumpsuit. not a problem! absolutely a
This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground  i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats  this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.
Such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery. it's very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately. i ordered the 6p because the 8p was sold out and although the top fits quite well  its just too snug on the hips. if the 8p was available i would definitely exchange it for that.
This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans  white jeans  shorts  dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!
This is a swingy shape which means a lot of fabric on the bottom half. so many retailer tops could be maternity wear for this reason  i'm ready for the trend to die out! that said  this print is very pretty and the fabric is great - not sheer for a nice change. i'm returning it because the arm holes are large and my bra shows at the sides. this is a pet peeve of mine. i don't want to wear a cami under a tank. almost a home run  i'm tempted to try one size down but i wouldn't like it shorter so i p
For starters  the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top  but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top  the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.
I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up  everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material  v-cut  and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.
This is a gorgeous blouse  but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs  and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small  and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely  just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.
I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but  like the previous reviewer stated  not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes  despite the wash discrepancy.
Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however  when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back  so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.
Unfortunately  the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up  unbuttoned  like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.
I wanted to love this. the fabric and design are very nice. unfortunately - on my petite frame it looked like a lampshade. this would be very pretty on taller girls. for reference  i am 5'3 117 34b.
Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!
This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.
Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape  and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!
I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute  but serious size issues  i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!
Gorgeous sleeves  flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much  i decided to buy it  knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these "easy breezy" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture  i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh
Beautiful dress  wonderful fabric  very well made  just runs really small! so sad  i wanted this dress for a special event!
I loved this in the store  but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.
Even on my 5'1"  short-waisted  100 lb body  this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
After seeing the picture online  i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it  but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big  but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to
I am pretty standard size 8  36c  5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;  150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!
This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2  this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi ' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1")  and the fabric  while structured  was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass.
5'7"  135lbs  34c  27-28 waist. typically wear between a 2 or 4 in maeve. bought an 8 in this. blouse is incredibly sweet - the white is beautiful but i opted for the black bc it seemed more internship appropriate. the front and back are completely different lengths - not a traditional high-low. the fabric has little to no give and the back has buttons running down. size up 1 or 2 sizes to avoid popping buttons! gorgeous with jeans or pair with some fun cigarette trousers (cartonnier  for exampl
There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also  i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.
These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them  which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7".
I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well  when it went on sale  i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut  long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10") and beautiful colors.     i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses  i'm 145 lbs  36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad
I really wanted to like this top. in fact  i have put it on to wear several times then opted for something else. so i'm thinking it has to go back. for one thing  the yoke part is sewn onto the bottom so the stripes are crooked...that bothers me. i may get it in the white instead because i do like the style. i just wish it were in a solid color. but try it - it might work for you!
I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs. i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37  30d/32c bra  with narrow shoulders and torso  a bit long-waisted. the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight. low cut  but not as low as on the model; very flattering neckline. sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded up.  .  well made  very lightweight knit of 57% cotton  43% polyester. the ribbing detail is very well thought out. there is bias
This sweater is wonderful for late summer/early fall or cooler weather over long sleeves. the sleeves taper just below the elbow  which seems slightly odd when first putting it on - as though they should be a tad longer (hence the 4 stars)  but i quickly forget about this while wearing the sweater and it does look great!
So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0
I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top  once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif. i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large. it's a shame  the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty  go up a size or two. if you are usually a
I am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute  durable  yet comfortable and not frumpy. these are definitely the ones i was looking for. the fit is great - not too tight and not too baggy. i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site. i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places - dressed up or down.
Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out  and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well  but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality  but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.
I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright  cheerful  well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain  especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but  also mint green jewelry too.
This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather  chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.
I saw this online when it was full price and was tempted to buy it because i liked it  but did not. when i saw it on sale  definitely wanted to try it! i bought a large and it was too big in the torso area  so i returned and got a medium and it fit better and flattered my figure better. i so rarely wear a medium in anything retailer  so i would say this runs large.  i have received 6 compliments on this dress the first day i wore it! it is comfortable  love the colors and design  it is fun. very g
This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall  a pretty horrible dress. save your money 
This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then "flare out" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look.
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique  however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.
I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a "mom jean" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.
This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.
The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no "shimmer" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.
The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not  hang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it.
These shorts are perfect. not too short  but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my "hyphen" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose  order true to size. they do stretch at the waist  so if you want them to fit true to size  order one-two sizes down.
I love the look and the simplicity of this top! it's very casual  but also super cute. my only issue with it was the fabric started to ball up after a few wears. but i still love it!
This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut  especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans.     only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more.     need to bring
The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!
The "movement" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some  "yeah  i can wear these attitude!" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is "thick" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs  and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh
I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall
Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture & detailing to your outfit. the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing.
This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.
I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich  making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh  the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern  and am planning on wearing it to work on friday.
Sctrachy  short  boxy  stiff.  loved the idea of this sweater  but this was not what i was hoping for
I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online  and decided to order it. the fabric is soft  but strong  and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.
This is quite large for akemi & kin i typically wear a medium but will be returning for a smaller size.print and flow of top are stunning.
Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy  and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit "off " as the background color is a gray  which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large  as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow  but it was very tight all around  especially around the bust area. going to have to return this...
As much as i wanted to love this top  it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.
This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it
This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!
I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!
I love this poncho. i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting!
A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but  i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall  great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
Loved the styling  versatility  fit & quality of this top! length was good  not too fitted  perfect piece under cardigans & jackets. will look great with jeans  leggings or skirt. very happy with this purchase.
This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
I purchased in the raspberry  love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool  and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.
This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.
This dress!!!! i had to try it on. of course i fell in love with it. it is so gorgeous in person  like a piece of unique artwork. you'll never find a dress like this!
I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said  i hand washed it  as the tag states  then let it line dry  and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states "dry clean recommended." boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.
Great  really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it's still a little big  but it works. i'm 5'1"  95lbs.
In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric  flow  and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however  the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress  but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!
Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide  but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!
I can wear this to work or dress it up as a cocktail dress. the fit is great  and the quality is very high. am usually a 2 or a 4  depending on the dress  and the 2 worked better in this one  so if you are between sizes  i would size down.
I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts  leggings  trousers  jeans...with a vest  jacket  or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy  it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule
I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.
The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top  if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium  and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton  but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus  the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le
Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me
The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.
I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design  the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs. they weren't my size  but  to my surprise they could be ordered in my size  still at the sale price.  the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them.
The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(
After reading the reviews  i was hesitant to purchase  but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand  but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase  especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.
This jacket is perfect and drapes very well. i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on  it was a "yes". if you are between sizes  as one reviewer mentioned  size down. it's tts but has a little extra room for me on the 2  so i sized down to 0. 5'4" 115lbs.
This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.
I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite  added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!
Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
I saw this dress in the store tried it on and   love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14)  plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun
I tried this cardigan on today at retailer and i absolutely loved it! it's much cuter in real life than it looks online. it's a perfect sweater for my skinny jeans--long sweater--tall boots winter uniform.
After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls  but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.
The design and workmanship of this dress are outstanding. the fit may be tricky for some. i am small busted and the bust and even the neckline are very tight and fitted. still flattering  though. i typically wear a 0 or 2 in dresses and purchased this in a 2. i could have worn a 4. 5'8 127lbs. the length is perfect as i purchased this in navy for a wedding. the navy cami slip underneath is top quality with adjustable straps and snaps to hold them in place at your shoulder. overall a sweet and dr
This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the "one size" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.
Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.
I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful  the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn't want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it  it is just too comfy and cute!
Totally see through.
Measurements: 30aa / 24" waist 5'4"  i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel  so it makes you look shorter than you really are.  the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders  so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely.
I tried this on in the store and loved it. it is very comfortable. i sized up one or two sizes. i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length. it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall. i think it looks better in person than online. would recommend it if you like this kind of dress. love that it has pockets too. great quality.
This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops  but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!
This is the perfect top. it is adorable  and the fit and cut of it is forgiving.
This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on  i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous  because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one  but only on the front 2  the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting
This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost  so i'd definitely wear a tank under.
This sweater is super light-weight and is very cute.
This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.
These do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall. after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like. thanks fellow reviewers because i'm pleased. when i first put them on i said no. the waist was a tad big (but comfy# and the legs seemed tight. with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle (29 inch inseam) i thought these looked ridiculous. however  once i had them on for about 10 minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo
This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small  but it was still gigantic.
This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great  the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.
.unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips  so it wasn't very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd  and off center. i had to return. pretty color  though.
This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this  i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted  the bottom is very fluid).
Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
Loved my. mustard colored ones so much  i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!
The model makes this dress look amazing  but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful  i loved that  but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full  not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but  sadly  it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you  but few others.
Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all  unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.
I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just "knew". when i finally got home and tried it on  it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck  coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then  you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.
I tried on xs petites as someone had returned it . i didn't find that it ran small  it was ok on me. i am not sure if the regular size would work but i didn't end up purchasing this today as the color was jsut so-so on my skin tone.  likes: contrast and detail in ruffle  romantic  dislikes: the tag pulled on the fabric a bit and you could tell  so the fabric seemed fragile.
I didn't think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website. but after reading the reviews i decided to order it. and it did not disappoint. i ordered the green  which is more vibrant in-person than on the website. and i wore it the next day  which is always a good sign. i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too. it is flattering  stylish and comfortable - an excellent combination! i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple. it goes with everything.
I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small. i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy  so i would say it runs true to size. it is very soft and the weave is airy--not going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style. the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to. the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands. the sweater  when pulled all the way down  covers my butt and half my thighs (and i'm 5'9" t
This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist  feminine hips.
I normally wear a small and sometimes a medium. even the extra small feels large all over and in the length. it's gorgeous though.
On me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu. it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming. i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier  no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try  just not for me...    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
I agree with the other reviewer  this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.    ___________  pros:  - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend  making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.  - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.  - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.  - ran tts. i'm 5'9  hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.  ___________  cons:
Kicky looking pants  that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight  boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice  fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids  but i guess i lied.
I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
This blouse was so cute  i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned  there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person  but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.
Very pretty skirt  makes me feel very feminine and makes my waist look smaller than it is.
Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on  did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.
I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces  and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.
I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.
Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual  not sloppy. my only complaint  the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans.
Beautiful well fitting top. you can't tell from the picture but the entire top is sheer so you need a tank or camisole underneath.
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
This is a cute  casual romper but i'm on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that's why i'm on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0  (5'7"  115lbs  32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!  wi
Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.
What a cute top! i would say true to size. it is a pullover so i went with a 6  for easy dressing. the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely. i would say the top is a lined in cut. not too swingy at all. a great length to be left out or tucked in. i can think of so many uses for this top  i may grab another to keep on hand. will be adorable with skirts or shorts.
I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.
I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.
I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says "cold water wash". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!
These run a tiny bit large  but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!
I'm 5'9" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.
If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it  however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever  though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me  and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky  which it does mention. maybe a little expensive  but i did use a coupon.
I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly  these will be going back.
Great style but not so great quality:(  stone fell off right away.  but they still look great
This sweater is a beautiful  quality  well-made  piece of art! it looks on  exactly like it looks online. when i ordered it  i was worried that my usual size  xs  might be too tight. however  it is a perfect fit: it is fitted  yet  it still has a comfortable looseness (with some extra room in the length of the arms). for reference  i am 122 lbs  5'4"  36-17-36. the color is a perfect match to the pilcro serif navy/marin leggings. of course  i am always apprehensive about stretching and/or shrink
Like the swingy fit. looks nice with a long fitted tee underneath and skinny jeans. the color online says black but it looks more like a faded black like it has been washed too many times.
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.
I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"  120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this  but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material  so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!
I ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it's so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it's nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces  vests  pins  belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable  pret
Love the fabric and it seemed warmed. but as other reviewers mentioned  the neckline was awkward.
I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9" a 36 dd size 12. the colors  the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.
I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!
Absolutely fantastic top  the cut is very flattering and the colors are gorgeous in the pattern (i also bought the white).
Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.
I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress  but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person  (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved)  but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.
This tee is so comfortable and stylish. you can easily dress it up. i love how the back covers your assets  and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls. a great buy on sale! i bought a small and bought 3 colors!
This shirt style is boxy  however  the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear
This is a soft  comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular t-shirt - not dressy  but a little more put together looking. it also doesn't wrinkle  so it's my go-to travel shirt for warmer months.
Runs huge! returning the m for a s; normally a m top and s bottom in sizing. very soft  wonderful colour.
Tried on a size 2 regular and it fit well  felt incredibly soft and airy  and is handwashable. i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37 or 38  with narrow shoulders and torso  somewhat long-waisted but petite from bust to shoulders. i often wear a size 0p or 0 in retailer dresses and tops. the arm holes were a tiny bit low  but not terrible. a petite would have been shorter  but also more of an empire waist. the pink really is more of a red like the online photo; great color.
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short 
I am 5'2" and 125 pounds and wear a 4p. i ordered the size 4 with the willingness to hem them; my goal was to get this true high-wasted style  which is extremely flattering. when the pants arrived  i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring. the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully. the true high waist flatters  but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist. i am so happy with my purchase!
I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.
This sweater is a must have for fall!! super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down. i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots!
Can't say enough about these pants. i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don't love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section. cue these darlings! with out any buttons  zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp. i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o
I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering  but then i'm not very busty  so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only  but well worth it for such a unique  pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.
Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:)  i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price.
It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint  but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy  warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
Love this poncho - plan to take it to europe this fall. warm and cozy yet not constricting. great neutral color!
I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi
The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.
I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top; it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe. the cowl is just right-not overly 'chunky' or awkward; it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest. this blouse 'softens' the face-just what i was looking for-i needed a soft-looking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit 'more' than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled. this blouse filled the bill quite nicely. it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts. i am 5'5"
This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a "cotton-rayon jersey" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.
These are super cute shorts - great pattern  pockets (yay!) and really nice fabric. but  they're just a little too short for me  run a little small  and the side zipper is something of a pain -- i don't know if it was a construction issue on the pair i received or a stupid user issue but it seemed as if the seam with the zipper was just off -- not really a side seam but more toward the back. plus  the zipper sticks on the waistband seam making it even more difficult to zip. i wish i had read the
The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top  lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for  and while i'm only around a b
40% sweaters...i couldn't pass it up. unfortunately  when i raise my arms  my tummy shows (i'm 5'6")  so i had to return it.
I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou
Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5  size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe.
I think this shirt is so cute. it is well-made. it's a flattering fit  and it's unusual. it still is a neutral though so you can wear it with lots of things. i'm really happy i bought it.
This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size  typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed  small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on. too bad  but it went back
Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.
Love everything about this: the length  cut  look  etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect.
While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
I was really excited for this sweater  its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.
This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago  love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.
Been searching for a denim "trucker" jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock  purchased it online without thinking twice. typically  due to my small upper frame  i'm 5'4  130lbs  34 a for referance  i'm between a size small and an xs. bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived.   i love the fit  slightly cropped in the back and i also like how it"s lined inside. great quality and perfect for fall!
I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
My preference is clothing made of natural fibers  but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric  the color   the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6  i bought a 4. maeve  i like your style!
This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.
I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.
I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.
I am not going to keep this dress  just because i am a little too old and need a little more structure for my figure. but it is a very cute  comfy throw-on dress. you could wear tennis  bootles  etc.   especially great for a pretty slender person ..then the loose flowy style is still attractive
Love the blue color  different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff  but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.
I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium  depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back  it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru  though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north  with tights and boots  you can too. so worth the price!
I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it! when my usual size 2 was unavailable  i sized down to a 0 because it looked plenty big and it fits fine. i bought the ivory color and love it! i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts. it's a lovely shade of ivory  quite flattering. boxy tops are often not for me  but this one is perfect!
I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!
I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs  however  i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
My favorite of the season. i purchased the grey sweater while shopping with girlfriends. i love it so much i'll be purchasing the brown as well. i would normally wear a m/l but tried it on and purchased a s. i don't like very fitted items. however  a small fit perfectly on me. this item runs big.
Great green color combo  runs a bit large but  hangs nicely! really spruces up a t-shirt and jeans. wish i purchased the black and white as well!
The sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back.
This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
Sizing is just getting unreasonable  and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model  but on my 5' 4" 115 lb frame  the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally  the shirt looked like it shrunk in length  and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i
The jacket runs large so size down. it's a good jacket to throw on the go. but i don't see this lasting long bc after he first wash  it started piling. the quality of the material isn't great!
I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through. taking it back.
I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;)
This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!
I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it
This dress is lovely- exactly as pictured on the site. love the colors/pattern and received so many compliments when i wore it to a brunch party. could easily be dressed up for an outdoor wedding. it definitely runs big- i am usually an 8/10 and originally ordered in a large. was way too big  so had to exchange for a m and there was still some room. make sure you size down!
Despite retailer's claim that they have "fixed" the button issue on this coat  beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th  feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed  because retailer indicated "rest assured  this issue has been fixed" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle  i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di
The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.
I definitely like unique things  but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable  but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.
I adore maeve tops  and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a)  ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3  105 lbs  ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely  but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on  either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit  so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing
I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile  the top can't be too see through  it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.
I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return  even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight  neckline too high/chokes  fabric is rough  outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!
This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back  and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough  so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer  and the embroidered dots are well done.
I saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.
I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.
I love this top. it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer. the material has a slight burnout effect. the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work  i will need to add one.
Paige denim has done it again with this version of the hoxton high rise. no matter how many times i tell myself that i will find a less expensive pair of jeans  i never can find jeans that fit as well and last as long as my paige jeans. this is a sleek pair of skinny jeans with the added benefit of being high waisted. as a mom who hates always having to worry about spilling over the top of my jeans (no matter how thin or fit you are  i'm sorry ladies  this problem is real!)  the hoxton high rise
This chemise is so comfortable and beautiful. can be dressed up or down and is a staple of a bohemian wardrobe. gave 4 stars for the fact that it is completely see through and requires a (not included) slip underneath. also because the super thin cotton will wear easily.
What a disappointment and for the price  it's outrageous!
I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top  but i don't see how i can wear it.
Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.
Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering  and the shirt naturally comes away from the body.
I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes  typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter  but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser  but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.
I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.
Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding. the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans. i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan ! the size medium for my 34 dd chest  145 lbs and 5 '4 inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look. i agree with the other reviewer--- more colors and more of type of quality  and character please for seasons ahead! lo
Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.
I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.
I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops  but went with the small so it wouldn't be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall!
This is really a lovely top  but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit  the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the
I loved this top on the mannequin  so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10  i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..
I didn't pay much attention to this shirt on the website...when i was in the store yesterday though  i grabbed the green color because it's so pretty! i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised. the picture here really doesn't do it justice. it's very soft  has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out (like snow white...which isn't my goal!). also  because the sleeves drape nicely  you could wear it under s
Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well  and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer  i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back  so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders  but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu
I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.
This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute  soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck  pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered 2 sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a 2 petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m
I loved the look of this top when i saw it online  however  when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful  but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!
Perfect cozy sweater  nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts.
At 5'4"  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!
Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.
Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5")  it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter  the sleeves are huge  the neckline was falling off my shoulder  i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes.
I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell  which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair  after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4)  they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now  but it's disappointing.
I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however  like many tops lately  it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
The color and fit of this dress is fabulous. i can't wait to wear it out.. casual with flats or dressy with heels. love it!
I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4  but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
I wanted to love this skirt but i got it today and i just was a little disappointed...i read all the reviews but i found it ran small and really fitted not straight pencil like on the model! it is a knit...and it looked like cotton...has a lot of give but it hangs a little weird. the panel in the front doesn't lie flat and looks a little funky! the colors in the skirt look exactly like the picture on line so that was good... i liked it but didn't love it and for $98.00 i want to love it! i am be
I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!
I bought these on a whim  patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well  look great and i had lots of compliments.
I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals  flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age  but it doesn't at all.
I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness  simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles  pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it  consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.
This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful  but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but  the rest of the dress is loose  as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders  i'd be swimming in this dress. so  all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo
Thrilled this statement piece is back. i get so many compliments on this and it's practical as well for our cold minnesota winters. highly recommend!
First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!)  plus 2" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side  it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one  but know that it is also delicate. after one use  there is a snag on the inside
I got the pink version. it is a pretty color  but the metallic border is painted  not a metallic yarn. the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy. it looks cheap to me--not what i expect from retailer. am returning.
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.
Love this top!!  great colors and fits great  reasonably priced
I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities  for me  ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4" and 125  hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.
The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice  it makes them look wide and short. well  that might be why these are percect for me  but on my body type (muscular bottom)  they are awesome. the material is stretchy  soft  and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color  so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs  i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly  but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal
Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27" waist  37" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit  especially around the waist  but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look
I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice  not as dark as the photo as others have said.
I'm a vest lover of all shapes  lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end  the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest  drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose  i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8" 140#.  overall i sent it back.
I loved how this looked on the model  however  once i tried on in store  i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.
I work with children and have a casual dress environment  this top gives me much needed style to my work wardrobe.
This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.
I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy  poor quality for the price.
My mother  who is not a dress person  ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress  and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile  she decided to try it  and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images  but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully  and looks extremely elegant.
The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still  very nice tee  i love cotton  it simply is the best. colors are nice too.
This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!
Quality of this dress is excellent! i ordered it in blue and the color looks exactly as it does online and the fit is exactly as it looks on the model. i am 5'4"   120 lbs  with an athletic build and ordered a small.
I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.
Ok  so this is adorable. i am 5'3" and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly. the back was too long and hung funny on my short body. after it was reworked  it is the cutest thing i own. they also made the little belt tighter across my waist. it is super versatile. my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine. so---- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention.
I am 5' 8"  145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore  i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however  the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore  i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j
This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors  pattern  and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small  and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs  and the body of it was just right  but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses  but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short  wide and unflattering. however  i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette.
Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!
Love these pants. it's hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch  and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool  like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them.
As a lazy one  i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big "thank you" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design  perfect fit and perfect material  soft  cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3" ordered size
Full disclosure  i'm six months pregnant. as such  this dress is perfect for me. it's soft and flown  and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like i'm wearing a sack. i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews  and t fits perfectly--so it would have been too big normally.
I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.
I've been looking at these online for a while now  and couldn't decide if they'd fit me or not. i have large  muscular thighs and pants always run tight. when i was in the store today i decided to try them on anyway  and boy am i glad i did. the fabric is super soft  as everyone else mentions  and they are nice and loose  but also look like ankle pants. i actually sized down! (who doesn't love it when they get to do that?!) i loved the way they fit so much  i bought two pairs. i love the pastel
Super long even at 5'7" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me  so even at the sale price they're going back.
I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however  i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans  the same  from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale  i was not happy with the quality.
First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.
I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.
I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it's gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it's so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8"  athletic build and a normal medium  this runs large. i bough smalls.
Haha  the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline  i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which  with my full bust underneath it  refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.
This top is adorable  especially the grey check. timeless staple  with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d  i got a small  it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering  the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu
These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright  cheery  and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2  so i ordered the xs  and they are just right.
I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.
Great material. quality and versatility is there. it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist.
This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect  i have a longer torso  so the waist was a bit higher than mine  but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested  and the top fit me very well  i think if you have been blessed in that area  you may want to size up.   overall  it really is beautiful  the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i
This skirt has a beautiful  flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and  of course  the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year  dressed up with jewels  or down with boots and a casual sweater.
I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.
When i first saw this dress i was in love. i adore mexican print clothing and i couldn't wait to try this on. unfortunately  it is not as described  and it looks better in the photo than in person. the dress looks like it is embroidered  and it is not- the design is printed. second  it is described as a stretch fabric-lycra spandex-there was no stretch at all except for the back waist which was elastic and the fabric was very stiff. it pulls on over your head and there is no zipper. i couldn't e
I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer  and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think  120-lb marathoner)  and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th
The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work  but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(
I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but  after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12  so this was definitely a maxi on me. but  there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add
The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the "skirt" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl
This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb  just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work  or be a different hue in real life  but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot
I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering  yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s
I love this dress. you can wear it for everyday or you can put some bling with it and dress it up. it fits very well. flattering. i highly recommend!!
This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big  so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!
High quality  great color  loved the neckline. unfortunately a little too snug on me so it showed my bulges on waist and back. not too snug if you don't have that problem. i loved this shirt but had to return it.
I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining  which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s
This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine  and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything  but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store  and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material  so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt  and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
First the good: what a beautiful  figure flattering dress. the fabric is stiff feeling  but the dress is well lined  so you can't see through it  and it hides lumps and bumps well. feels very quality. the lining also means it isn't scratchy. the stripes are very figure flattering for apple shapes like me (i'm 5'5"  165 and thick through the waist...this dress gives me the illusion of actually having a waist. l fit perfectly)  and i love the saucy little cut out over the knee: not so high that yo
Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach  but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.
Lovely  but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked  so pretty in the picture!
One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.
This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular  curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
I purchased these pants once i saw them go on sale. i had seen them a little while back but with summer coming to an end  i didn't want to spend $88 for a pant a wouldn't wear often. the $49 plus 20% off is a great price. they are really cute and just as pictured. good quality too. however  they were at least 3 inches too long. i am 110lbs  5'3" and ordered the xs like i always do. they fit perfectly except for the length. worth the $20 to get hemmed.
I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately  the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area  but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture  i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank
Really stretchy and therefore not a whole lot of compression. love the floral pattern and the color  but they're also surprisingly thin. they'll be good for yoga in the summer months  but i find them to be too thin to wear outside of the gym and i like a legging i can feel comfortable in running errands to and from the gym too. fit true to size.
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fits nicely in this blouse. if you are athletic or slender or have a petite bust  you can probably size down.  .  this is a nice lightweight sweater. i would not say that it is too thin or anything like that; its just lightweight for being categorized as a sweater. i absolutely love the pattern placement of this sweater  it makes the sweater so unique and figure flattering. honestly  i'm not crazy about kimono/bell sleeves because i feel they are at best impr
Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
This dress was ok - i thought the fabric was soft  but not my favorite. it's a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down. but  i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my - would be better on a different body type.
I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website  and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely  flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5" 4" and it skims the floor on me with a 2" heel. can't wait to wear it!
I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper  the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper  so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper  i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???
I had my eye on this for a while  and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then  however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite  decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich  and the design is subtle  adn will nto fall apart  so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j
These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5"). i can go between a 4 and a 6  and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said  the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately.
I ordered the xl in white. for fit  it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but  the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh  crisp white shown  at least for the one i received.     the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall  i don't think it's worth ful
Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious  i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(
I love the style of this top  there's good stretch to the fabric so it's very flattering. the length is good for me  as the previous review stated  it's a little long but for me it's lengthening. the lace is lovely  too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.
I finally visited a store with petite  and this dress was there  so of course  i snagged it to try on... i love the colors  i mean awesome  the fabric is also very soft  but the cut was just huh on me  nothing to go raving about .   i think it would be nice for a casual day but i often just wear joggers or yoga pants on casual days... so for the price i left it.
I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down  but i bought it online  so i just decided to live with it. pretty top  though i do think it runs large.
Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all  they don't stretch out over the day.   i'm 5'10  a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly.
The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.
The fabric was more "southwestern" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.
This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up  i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however  the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice  additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves.       i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n
Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back
I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy  thin  and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back  it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.
Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.
This top is lace done extremely well  i love the silk  the double attached layer  and the length. dress it up or down  this top is a definite show stopper. it does run small in the arms though  size up!
Cute top  wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer  but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event  then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.
This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me  i believe. however  the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but  i sent it back.
The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.
I wish these fit more like joggers  but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons  i felt a bit too clownish. however  it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics  so it holds more volume instead of loose  semi-flowy menswear look. i
Received this and love the style  but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso.
This was my favorite piece of apparel i have purchased in a very long time! fun  trendy and comfy yet dressy piece. dress it up or down based on the occasion.
I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model  it's a little bit frumpy  but it was so pretty that i tried it. however  on my short frame  it's even frumpier. the quality is very good  the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"  110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p  but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a
Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one
I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice  soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front  but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit.   the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional  b
I wanted so much to love this dress  but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it. the color of the dress (green) was lovely  and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much. i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large; but even at that size the dress was too large  especially around the hips (which  for someone with an hourglass figure  is saying a lot!). the extra fabric around the hips belled out some  making
So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small   but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn't as r
This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts  and the cut is very flattering. however - the "white" is actually ivory. not a big deal  unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not.
I reallllly love this sweater! i could wear it every day if i could. the sweater is comfortable  lightweight (but not see through) and versatile.
I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade  slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size  however  to get the perfect fit.
I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out. however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat. sadly  it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest  like shoulders were too short. for reference  i am 5 feet  109lbs  and a 32d. i didn't mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for
This top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10  12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...
These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size  but seem to stretch  so buy a size down. trust me  it will work.
This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me  so if in doubt size down
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
I was really excited to get this dress  i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on  it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit  and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there  and the look of the dress on line was beautiful  but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look  and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.
I really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall
I like the design of the dress  but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress  i had expected better quality.
I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model  and from the reviews. i found it to be super big  and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5"10  155lbs. i sent it back.
Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
The title says it all. while the quality was good  when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5")  which was ok  but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs  which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!
I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!
This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.
I got an xs in this suit.  i am 5'1  100#  a32.  this was much much too small.  it was very tight around the chest and i am only a 32a.  it is  however  a good looking suit.  i suggest sizing up.
Although i bought 2 sizes down from my regular size  they were still big and  made my derriere look flat. i would have kept them as weekend kick-around jeans  but the flat behind just made them a must return.
Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5"  a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line  almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the
I didn't expect the fit to be as cute  i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top  but untucked  or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person  still light turquoise  but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy  but not oversized or boxy.
This dress is a great color  fabric  and the style is very flattering! i'm wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall! dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church!
The texture  mixed yarn  and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said  the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy  almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.
I ordered this in size xl and it ran small. i'm a pear-shape and thought this style would be flattering. i have a few other peplum-style sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites. but  the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and don't flow well. i found it to run short too. it's cut one size too small. i would have sized up but  being xl  there's no option for that. i'm returning mine.  the applique is done well and is cute. the colors look the same in person.
I have a few pair of these from prior years and would like another in a dark color. every time i check  the size 24 regular are sold out! please make more size 24!
I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on  but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress  which i think is nice  no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about  but it ties the dress together nicely. the front pocket is different  but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before
I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
This should have been cute  but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.
I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute  but it was huge  shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.
This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft  comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.  i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!
I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.
I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous  it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back.
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4". the large fit like a small on me  and not like a typical oversized sweater type small  but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight  and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the
Beautiful color  bought a small (i am 5'10 and 145 pounds  the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me) however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought  i am only a 34b. i'm returning it. i did think it was pricey for what you get as well. the color was by far the best thing about this dress  it could have been better quality and fit.
When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person  it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4  but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected  considering i have a 32dd bust  but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes  even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders  so maybe that
This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric  the top is a little thin  but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer  but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress  but not enough to dissuade me.
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s
This top does look as pictured  the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time  they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great  but on it's on  i don't know  just not for me. for reference  i am 5'8'' 128lb
Comfy and different. almost like a sweater fabric.
I like the style and the design of this culottes  but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface. i had a few loose loops for just one wear... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping   but not good to go to the park or play with kids...
The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
I love this sweater because it is an edge to it  fit is true to size and its soft and confortable
These are flattering and the colors are really nice. they're a bit tighter than other pilcro pants i've tried  but the material is stretchy.
I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however  after just wearing them twice  the threads of the leaves are fraying  and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone  or at least much less "white" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad  they were l
Gorgeous fun dress  but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra  but i think its a winner for someone.
Great dress in terms of material  quality  print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers  but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i"m 5'5" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed.
I never owned an 'older' version  so nothing to compare to.  i found it comfortable  stylish and warm on a cool fall day. the minor piling made it look more rustic  has not shed on any of my other clothes so far...
The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment  and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes  and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
This skirt was very figure flattering  and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides! has a great look
I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.
I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute  but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear.
These are awesome! classic style and quality you'd expect from ag. the mid-rise is nice for moms like me that are not interested in low-rise jeans. tts. i'm 5'8"  135# with a curvy bottom and wear a 29  which is my normal size in ag.
I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress  especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash  it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also  it is definitely not a "day dress"--i wore it as a swim coverup  but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and  for lack of a better way to describe it  cheap looking. the white banding around the t
I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper  looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit  lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
Cute top  i actually got a lot of compliments on it.  the white is slightly see through  which doesn't bother me but could bother other people. all around cute casual piece.
I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty  and while it's very lightweight  it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.
I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.
This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off  and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.
I bought the "light grey" color. the dress in the photo does not look a thing like the dress in person  it does not look grey at all but more of a light teal/light blue.  it is absolutely gorgeous and has a slight swing shape. i took my normal size xs.  the end of the sleeves (where the buttons are) are very tight but still fit  you just have to be careful taking off or else undo the buttons.  also online inventory says no one has this in store  but i did end up finding it (rockefeller).
The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
I bought this to celebrate my birthday! i get a new "suit" every year. it was a milestone birthday and this dress did not disappoint.
The design is loose and forgiving  and it is very comfortable. the fabric is soft and light weight  and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them! it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on. you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great go-to top on the weekend. i also bought the purple version - it says it's mauve in the description  but it's really more of a pale lavender color. still very pretty  but i wish it was mauve!
Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper  trouser-like pant--this is not it!
I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me.   i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.
It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small
I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.
This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
I'm 5'4 and 125 and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28  i'm 52 so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors.
Just be prepared: this is huge! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p. this was in store  luckily  the the excellent personal stylist warned me. i also don't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull. if it fits you  it could be nice.
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.
I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.
I love  love these wide leg pants! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special. they are comfortable  and perfect. the length is great for wedges  and the fold over waist does not add bulk. the only downside  and this is probably due to my figure  but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat.
Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.
Just received two  the red and the black. the black is a great print  very versatile. both run large  but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area  but (barely) covers my bra.    the material is somewhat thinner than expected  but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.
I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole  it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea  but not practical  even without a hole =)
I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.
So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem.
Love the tee but it is very thin. best for layering
Extremely comfortable t. fits tts. bought in black & teal. can be dressed up with a scarf or worn with just jewelry. fairly lightweight so probably not a good choice for cold winter months. great price too!
This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.
I really liked the lace up details and embroidery. the sleeves were too long for me and i was not a fan of the elastic on the sleeve...made it tough to push sleeves up. i took to my seamstress and her cut elastic out and hem the sleeve.   now its perfect!
It gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product  retailer! the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping. the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping. i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice (albeit short and i'm only 5'5" tall) i would have kept these. unfortunately  the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them. the f
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.
I bought this in black. it's a great long length. i have long arms so the sleeve length is great. it's really soft. only issue is seems to sag a little in the middle instead of being flowy. overall a good tunic.
These are perfect for pulling off a finished look  proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial  lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!
The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.
I loved the look of this dress online  and it's everything i hoped and more in person.  i'm 5'10"  155# and pear-shaped.  while the bottom of this dress is voluminous  it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shape.  the length was absolutely perfect  it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa.
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
I love this tee! i got the navy color and the quality is good. it's a light and soft linen that is opaque. (i can't vouch for the other color though). it's a very loose fit but it's not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge. i'm very short and the xsp comes to my hip. i'm almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too... the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide  it might show
Initially  i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.
I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall  which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso  the xsmall was better  but looked overall too short  as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9"  however the model is supposed to be 5'10".
This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down  super versatile. love it!
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.
I love this dress  the print is beautiful  the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me  this is an exception.    i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me  which i think i like more than if it were a midi.    the armholes do cut in  i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.    my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care  i'm wea
Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.
These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.
This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric  it's very boxy  & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(
These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.
I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm  soft and super comfortable. however  they stretch out a lot  as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house  but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable  but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"  130 lbs and the size small fits well).
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.
I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!
This sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter legging/boot rotation with different vests  belts  and scarves...spot on. it is not heavy weight  soft  perfect length for a tunic on a 5'4 frame  34c  125 lb....now the weird part - sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear??? anyway  hand wash and little to no pilling a plus. i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome  hence t
Love  love  love!  this is true retailer! the color is lovely and it's so soft! i love the seams in the back and the overall "raw seam" style.
So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that  no difference. in fact  it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously  if you do not dry clean this  you are going against manufacturer recommendations  but i
I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d  31" waist  38.5" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it  but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased.
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.
This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t
I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer  i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer  i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp
I had my eye on this piece since it came out  but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending... but it finally went on sale. alas  all the petite sizes are gone  but i decided to order the regular xs anyway. (the length quote is long  but i figured maybe with heels?). then the xxs became available and i snatched that too...so glad. the xxs fits better and isn't as long (i have to wear heels  don't get me wrong  but the xs was still long with heels). it is soft and lovely  the xxs linin
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.
I put this runs small but it's a little more tts  except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model  you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters  which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out  but th
These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel  yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine  sexy  comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small  wish i would've went for a petite x-small  however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3  110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.
I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
As with many of retailer's tops these days  there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well  though. the white color is cream  which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body  order down a size!
I wanted to love this top. perfect weight  length  and shape. unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you.
Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top  something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.
I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice  a little heavier and more formal.
I bought this sweater in the green and loved it so much i ended up ordering the pink also. it looks great with jeans or with a pencil skirt. the silhouette is flattering and the sleeves  though big  don't get in the way while i'm working. i'm a little worried about the looseness of the knit and the amount of lint it shed at first  so i don't know how long it will look and feel new. also  one of the buttons on the pink one was hanging by a thread when i first pulled it out of the package. at this
I really wanted to like this  but like other reviews say  the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale  but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white  as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.
I love this dress and will be purchasing it in other patterns. the fit is incredibly flattering and the fabric is lovely. doesn't wrinkle  easy to wash and wear. i am 5'7  190lbs  bottom heavy with a 38c bra size. i purchased the size large and it fits me perfectly (though perhaps a little bit snug in the waist). if i wanted a looser fit  an xl would probably work though might be a bit loose on the top. the low back hits just above my bra strap  but does in fact cover all straps. for reference 
I bought this dress on a whim.  i am so glad i did!  got it in black.  it is stunning and comfortable
This is a cute dress  but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small  2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame  this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller  thinner people. unfortunately  mine is going back.
This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
This is truly unique top  the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!
Like the other reviewers have said  this is a wider shirt  but the width done is in a stylish way. i did not think it looked frumpy or sack-like on. however  i found it to be rather short. i bought a 0 regular (not petite)  and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer  madewell  etc. which have the same looser fit. i am 5'2  115 lbs.  so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on me...if you are tall  it might bare your midriff some. i bought the peach  which was close to the color pictu
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.
The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b  150 5' 9"  tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.
I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work  but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes  (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes  but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white  but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small  which fit great.
This sweater runs a bit large/bulky around the bottom area. you can kind of see in picture. i purchased this online in medium as i'm 5'9 so normally wear that size. i could probably have ordered a small but will keep the medium  just a little too full around the hem. also  the v neck is somewhat low cut. pink color is nice and pale pink.
This top is lovely. it's got a decent length to it  so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt. the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy  which can sometimes cause it to slip/sag off the shoulder -- not entirely off  but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of off-shoulder look! it's very flattering if you tuck it in  or even if you don't. i got this top in red  and it's lovely --a little more towards than coral side than crimson.
This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.
Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices  but i think this skort will sell out well before then.
The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
This dress is a winner  i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m.
Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
I bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas  texas and i absolutely love it. i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come.   however  this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up. i am 5'10"  156 pounds  and usually wear a us size 6  but when i tried this dress on in a size 6 the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust. i end
Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering  great quality  and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great  is appropriate for work. love!
Although i'm returning  this is a cute top. the embroidery design on the front isn't really my style. it's a bit aztec-y for me.
I absolutely love these jeans! the rise is mid so it is perfect  not too low and not too high. the embroidered flowers are gorgeous and so unique. these pants scream retailerpolgie to me. i had to buy them as soon as i saw them because i know they will go fast. pilcro denim fits great! i ordered these online as my store didn't have them. i ordered my normal size 26 (2) and they fit great. i have an athletic build and they fit me like a glove with comfy room. i can't wait till the temperature gets
This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.
I love  love  love this skirt. very flattering. i am 5'7" 125# with a 27" waist  and ordered a size 4 based on previous reviews. yes  it is snug through the hips. i think it will stretch a bit with wear; however  i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up (sadly  i was not blessed with much in the way of curves). the material is thick. the skirt is lined. the print is beautiful. this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it.
Love this top! it's great for wearing with leggings. the material is soft and not too heavy. love the variation the zippers give you! i have in the moss and love it!
I'm normally an xl  but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body  but not tight-fitting  just as shown on the model.    the detailing at the shoulders is heavy  compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so  it pulls the neckline forward a bit.     i bought the red and wow! it's a bright  fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled.
Gorgeous dress worth every penny--one of a kind twist on a kimono!
I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures  a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.
I love this soft  glistening  flowy beauty!  it's my favorite color too!  i'm 5'5"  34d  size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don't wait!
This sweater is very nice. i bought it online recently with a discount on the discount and felt i got an amazing bargain. it is not larger than expected  but is not exactly the fit the model's picture implies. it is a roomier design. nonetheless  it is well-made and all wool  instead of that mystery mix of fibers that sometimes is the case with things described as "wool". the one thing that might be more discouraging to online buyers is that the color is not the lovely blue the picture depicts 
Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful  ordered it  shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!  i wore it last night to a st patrick's day party in california and received a ton of compliments. paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels.   i'm still smiling today  can't wait to wear it again. the fit is flattering and the quality superb.  thanks retailer
A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.
I liked it online  but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store  i was excited to try it on. however  it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better)  and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print  but that is the o
I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially  but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium  got the m/l and fits well.
Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!
The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.
I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.
I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool.   they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.
I've been looking for some new  casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"  not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however  i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it  however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this
These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work  but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.
I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
This is different from any bra i've had before  in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful  and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered  so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire  either  based on the s-m-l sizing  but it has one.
I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.
So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!
The cut is lovely and the fabric is wonderful-it's a little thicker than you might think so it felt a little warm. i am sending back as i have a little belly and it doesn't hide much-but it did make my boobs look awesome:)
I got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe  and i was not disappointed. the pants are well-designed and drape well. unlike a previous reviewer  i did not find the fabric to be cheap  but it is light and a little blousy--not bad for a warm region like mine. this polyester fabric has two advantages: no fading and no wrinkles. a good staple for work.
Love this tank. it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide.
This coat looks great  but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws  it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.
I purchased this dress in white and i love the color! i think it's a great casual look and it's really fun to wear. my experience has been that this runs true to size  i'm 5'4  120 lbs and i ordered a size xs.
I love the pattern adn color combo  but  wow t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway  not for me  but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.  length was decent in regulat size though  not too long. just too wide.
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.
Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6"  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!
Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
I loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite. i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy. it is just way to boxy/baggy for someone my height and weight. however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter. for reference i am 5'0" and weight 113 pounds.
I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.
This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for
First i definitely understand why most reviewers either adore or hate this dress. luckily for me it worked in my favor although i will point out the downsides too. (1) it runs small. the only reason i was able to fit my usual size is because i have a tiny bust and have been working to tone up. but still i had to maneuver to get the sidezip up. i would size up but....(2) being that this dress runs small it appears more fitted on top as if it were a fit and flare or bustier which i like. (3) you h
Comfy  gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing. the white is totally see through just fyi. i don't think it's the best quality but totally worth the sale price. i got the m and it's loose and flowy in a good way.
The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed  though  the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.  i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure  but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.  love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate  too. the sale price was a huge bonus.
I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5" 110 lbs  small frame.
I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also  not too long  which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy  though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans  pants  or a dress. the color is versatile. sl
Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.
I love this dress! i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering. i have worn it to several different occasions. it looks great with tights and boots and just flats. the lace detailing makes it unique.
Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.
Great fit  the fabric is supple and of good quality; has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable. can't beat that!
Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.
This shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it... however i felt like the fit was not flattering. it sort of just hung on me. didn't do much for me. i actually ended up returning it.
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online. i tried the red which is a beautiful  vibrant color. i wasn't sure how it looked on my skin tone though (pale like death)  so i ordered the black. i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders. i am normally a size 4 in shirts  but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted. i tried the 6 and it was plenty roomy. for reference  i am a 32c with athletic shoulders. overall...    pros:  -an
Great top! a little large  but i shrank it a little in the wash  and it fits a little better now. i love the structure and pattern of this top  as well as the lovely coral/orange color. it can be dressed up or dressed down! love it!
This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut  and that the buttons are covered. however  the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly  i don't think i can recommend this shirt  though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body  but it still looks great. i hope this helps!
I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me  however  is totally wrong. for reference  i'm 32dd  5'8"  140 lbs  and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking  too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution.
A lovely  creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand  but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right  probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender  the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.
Love this  but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic  the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it
This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size  and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l  and there is no stretch through the bust  so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest  this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap  skinny jeans and boots.
I purchased this top in the taupe color  and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large  and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for  but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models  but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans  but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f
I love this coat  and wanted it to fit so badly! a 12-14 always fits well  but i can't even start to button up the large in this coat. so sad!!!
This tunic is perfect from the waist up. the problems comes in with the pockets. they make the tunic bulky around the hips and who needs bulk there? the tunic is a little more gray in person than what it appears to be in the photo. i usually wear an 8 or a medium. ordered this tunic in a medium and i think it runs just a little big. i may try this in a small. if that doesn't work  i may consider having the pockets removed in the medium. just wish is wasn't so pricey for all the extra work. but i
This was long on me (i'm 5'1") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material  this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.
I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small  i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b  there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.
This is a beautiful  well made jacket. also  it's very cozy and warm. unfortunately for me  it was too short and wide. i ordered the petite  but it was still too wide which also made it look too short. not flattering for my small frame.
The cut is small. i am 5'9"  150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand.
This tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable. it is a bit loose  but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body. i lose my waist a little bit in this  but think it's a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage.
I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.
I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde
All the reviews have said the truth. this shirt is absolutely adorable in terms of the top. but you will definitely need this tailored at the waist. give it a little more taper at the seams to suit a woman's curves. it seems almost funny they didn't do it to start with given the really feminine details on this shirt with the lace and the sleeves...
This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole "loose fit" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.
Absolutely love this jacket - soft  nice amount of stretch  and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!
I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.
I'm 5'2"  weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.
This blouse is stunning on the website ;however  it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.
I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !
Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!
Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide  long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled  adding i
If this product was in petite  i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that.     fits nicely! i'm 5'4  130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into.     the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting.
I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however  lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store  they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i
If the sweater looked as it does in the picture  i would keep it. however  it was very boxy and short  a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.
I just received this in the mail today and i love it! its adorable- very flattering and hides all the spots you'd want hidden. i don't find that this runs too large. i ordered my usual size large and it fits tts. it's not meant to fit snug. i ordered this in the navy color- beautiful and flattering!
I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso  but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
I cant say enough about these pants - they are such good quality. i bought the xs. they are tight enough and don't create crease in my legs. length is perfect for my 5.1 statue.
I love this top. it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend. i am curvy  and the drape of the top works well on my frame. i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown  but i like the top too much to get sweat on it :)
I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model  but it was a cropped length on me :(
I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"  112lbs). the material wears like a tee  so it's comfortable  but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer.
I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did  it is a great top.
I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.
This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it  it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5"6" frame  so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant  a little chanel like. and by the way  the belt is included  as another reviewer
The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too "swingy" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1"  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.
Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great
The turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.  i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same.   obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed  they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.
I have more of an athletic figure  and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute  otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first  but i'm happy i did. they are higher quality than the typical legging. the sizing runs bigger than average.
I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model  that's how it should be when you try it on.  it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done  no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t
I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir
I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.
I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6" and 110 lbs  slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!
I'm 5'9" and this is a nice pencil-fit sweater skirt that is soft (not scratchy) and long enough. fun bias cut sweater pattern and pretty dark blue and black color.
I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality  but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+
If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me  it completely irradiates my shape  including my neck. this will be returned.
I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier  i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.
Not only is this dress incredibly comfortable  but it can be accessorized for any occasion. i jazzed it up for a wedding  but a cardigan and flats also makes it easy saturday perfect. only way this dress could be improved.... pockets.
This is a modernized hippie sweater  so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude  pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth  but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look  not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips  and the hem falls right above my knees).
Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)
I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top  so i wen
Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric  lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller  but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom  unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs  it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.
The small  zipped and laid flat  measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes  11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0  and not by just a little! too bad  because it really is very pretty.
The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it  and a slip dress underneath. this way  the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture  or left ope
I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not
I tried on the xs in store  but ti was a little big on me (and i usually get petite in dresses  unless they are mini dresses).  so i decide to order the xxs petite. it fits much better. the length is  at the highest point  just above my knees. the chest part fits better on me as xxs p  the plunge is not low  not too high  and is flattering  i can wear a regular bra that can attach as t-back and you won't see anything.   the model on the picture is what it looks like as a usual size (so xs instea
I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however  the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them  and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve.
Absolutely love this top  it falls perfect in all the right places. i've gotten so many compliments especially from the bow design on the back.
Completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me.....boxy  baggy  shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned.
Like other reviewers have said  this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return.
Fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.
The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.
I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick
Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
I don't normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
When i saw this top online i loved it  and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops  and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer  but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is  if you a little busty  the neckline might dip a tiny bit
I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it  but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash  it would help it. after washing  it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt  but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.
I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering
I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks  but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok  but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker  this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this  i wouldn't recommend.
Love the rushed sleeves  and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is  however  a little thin  hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt  jeans or other pants for casual days!
Perfect dress for the hot late summer/early autumn weeks! this beauty is flowy and rich in color. the tie back is adjustable which i love due to my weight fluctuations. because of the tie  length can be adjustable too! i'm short so the decision lies on what shoes i want to wear and how high i want my hem. this dress looks cute belted or with my cropped moto jacket thrown on top. all in all  i really like this dress and i see it staying in my closet for a long while if the horrid viscose construc
Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
I bought this in blue/black. it is so pretty. i get so many compliments. i'm a size 4/6 but large busted. i bought this in a medium & it's perfect. just the right amount of fullness. i'm 5'4" so the length for me is perfect w/leggings.
But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.
I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find  that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull  it was really large in the body. in addition  while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.
Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big  but this one is too small in my normal 4  so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality  colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events  or with a denim jacket over it for work :)
After reading some reviews about it running small i decided to order the 8 instead of my regular size 6 and bingo! i'm 5"7' 144 lb. dress hits right above my knees. i'm between slender and curvy.
Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
This is a very flattering blouse  but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size  so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton  gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on  but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer  and because of the lightness of the fabric  it does not app
Today i happened to walk into my favorite store with an already reduced 30percent off sale sign. i tried on this pants and let me tell you-wow!! they are super comfy and made my behind look great!! i will definitely start wearing these asap!!
I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim  and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely  thick  starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
Purchased this sweater in an xs  grey pattern (for reference  5'4"  small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey  but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.
I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference  i'm 5'4  130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.
I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly  being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!
I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.
This is such a great dress  i hate to return it. it's pretty  a nice material  and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said  it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs  or if it came in petite  i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not  it has to go back.
Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color  the fabric  and the fit  but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
Love the tunic. rich color. longer than i thought. i am 5'9"  140 and it almost comes to mid thigh. also ordered medium - it is roomier than anticipated. but looks good loose and flowing. overall love the tunic  the shape  style and will have big fun wearing it.
So simple to throw on with jeans  or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft  really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great  and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color  like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
Very comfy and really nice fabric. can see myself wearing these a lot. i'm a size 12 and the fit was perfect.
This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!
I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny  which in my opinion is in the "runs small" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway  the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top  and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where
These shorts are age-appropriate for all. they're loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee. the fabric is soft and colors are fun
I love the teal/aqua version. the colors are very pretty and look great with jeans. i got a medium. it runs a tiny bit small but a lot of fitted tops at retailer run smaller on me. i like the style a lot and the peplum is great.
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.
Super cute  well made  great embroidery. waist runs big.
This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4"  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online.
This is a great shirt for fall. very comfortable and flowy  without making you look dumpy. tried it on in the store  ended up waiting to buy online at the sale price.
Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4  135lbs  32e
I had a really  really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it  i wanted to love it! in theory  it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however  as you can see for yourself in the photo  this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely  and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side  but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all  but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size  but otherwise i would order your normal size.
This top looks beautiful online. when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back
I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n
I am 5'6" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft  and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top.
I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i'll still need to return this top.
This dress runs large!  i tried on a large  then a medium and then a small! couldn't believe i fit a small! this is a cool  breezy summer ensemble that you can wear anywhere! dress it up or down  it's comfy and makes you feel like you can breathe under its baggy motif. love it!!
This is very cute. it's lined  it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees  which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!
This fits so perfect! it is light fabric  not clingy. very flattering! i am 5'4 120lbs with athletic build.
I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.
Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.
I agree with the other reviewer the concept of this is fantastic. but sadly did not work for me. first of all it runs so small i normally wear a 6/8 and ordered a 10 and i still had a hard time closing over my 34ddd chest. but i am abnormal. anyways the peplum i wish was a little more subdued like in the photo. maybe its because im so curvy but it just didn't work for me. sadly its going back.
I love these tees  i ordered 2 of the map shirt. they are comfortable and stylish. i knew that i would wear it so much  so i bought a spare.
Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.
I purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small  but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou
The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly  it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi  it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.
I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived  the black already looked faded and old. also  the embroidery looks like a grandma  but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff  which causes a boxy  unflattering look. had to return it.
I love this blouse  it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans. it is loose and flowy  the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top. i happen to love the fabric  it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton.
Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
Like others reviewers mentioned on here  this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me  as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame  but for tall  busty  and curvier girls  it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.  however  i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel
This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!
This top is much stiffer  more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too  and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun  drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
I love the style of this dress  comfortable but chic  and it feels great!
Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice  i am a sucker for flowers  i also love the cut of it  teh tiered hem is very flatering  not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra  and the whole dress is super flowey  substantial amterial  and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom  gives it a nice shape). i can't say anything bad about this.     regular xs fit me but i would ahve t
I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.
Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.
This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes  or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #2 is shown: meaning  folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown  tan  or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch. ---------- my only "criticism" is this is a dolman-style/drop hem sleeve  which i am not a huge fan of - bu
This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.
Short of calling it dark gray- which  isn't dark  but that's fine because i saw the picture. it's everything i wanted it to be. i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often
I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.
It's definitely not a $100  blouse  but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer  but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details  very retro  light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.
I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up  i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip  so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want  but i really love these shorts  so it's not a deal breaker. overall  i am happy with them  but definitely size up!
I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.
Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.
This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!)  so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.
I was so excited to get this top... and while it is soooo amazingly soft  i still could not keep it. i must admit that i am only 5'2"  so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this... but i felt like a matador  which is definitely not what i was going for... maybe if your tall and lean  this would work.  but for me  no way.
I ordered this top in a 14  my usual size  and it fits fine  but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist  almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.
I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large  so size down (i am 5'4"  125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body  even though i generally wear things large). also  the collar was a hemmed flat collar  not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why  and the tiger embellishments were more orange  yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered.
The moment i saw this  i knew i had to try it on. it's a definite power dress - made me feel like marvel's agent carter! i could take over the world in this dress. planning to wear it to work  more casually  and as my holiday party dress. it's easy to dress up or down and is incredibly comfortable.
I bought these in my standard 27 (on sale  woop).  they are super comfortable with a bit of stretch for those days when you need a little extra room.  the ankles are easily cuffed and look great with ankle boots.  my only qualm is that they run a bit big and tend to gape in the back.  i love a higher rise jean and these are a great option but i'd lean towards sizing down.
I have an hourglass shape and this dress is a good fit. i think this dress looks better in person than it does in pictures. however  i'm concerned about washing it with that stark fabric and color change.
I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while  but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it  and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy  i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.
I have no need for this dress but had to have it. i read the reviews and when there was a sale weekend  pulled the trigger on it. just as reviewers noted  it's very flattering. from the front. and  just as another reviewer noted  the back torso is widely misshapen  creating a hunchback look. but i figured a good tailor could make it right. it's going to cost just under 2 jacksons to do it. which is about how much the discount was for the sale. but i expect to have this dress for years and can't
I tried this on a whim during the sale with no real intentions of buying but the moment i put this on i feel in love! the denim is soooooooo soft. it is heaven! seriously one of the most comfortable pieces i have ever tried on. the fit is very flattering and it can be worn multi seasons so..... it went home! that night i put it on and walked doen the stairs and my two year old daughter said "mommy is so pretty"! . score! this dress is so simple and can be styled so many ways. plus it seems very
I love this turtleneck so much!! got it in black. looks great with skirts and under sweaters. love that you can wear the collar two ways. drapes and clings perfectly. the silver snaps along collar are such a nice detail. details like this is what makes retailer pieces so unique. love it! i am usually an xs or small in tops. 34b bra size. i ended up with the xs.
I love the fabric  texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.
Love the fabric  print  and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline  but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is  it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better  but i returned it.
This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down. i was nervous it might be too flowy  but it lays very nice and is so pretty on!
This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8  it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.
I'm not usually a fan of ruffles  but this blouse has a very smooth and flowing  front. it's flattering and feminine without looking frilly. easy to dress up or down.
I really wanted to love this top  but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
I thought this top was so pretty and airy  but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
Not sure what to think! i had great plans for this dress
This dress is pretty  but there were a few things i disliked.    the overdress is fairly shapeless; however  the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer  the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress  the slip  and the lace. finally  as other reviewers have shared  the buttons are not functional  and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.     i recommend trying the dress
This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green  not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband  which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy  elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks  i decided to remove the tie string  which hangs low; it
So soft  light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful  with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside  even though it's just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.  i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s  which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.
I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again  i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).  colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh
Worth every single penny. size up - they are very tight!
I tried this blouse on and loved the style  comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.     but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars  as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable  soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
I love the ease of style of this dress. perfect for summer and to wear for a cruise. the only problem with the dress is that it comes unlined. if it was lined  it'd be perfect. if you plan to wear this over swimwear  it's great. if not  make sure to wear neutral underwear since it is partly see through. would need to get a slip along with this dress.     i'm 5' and got a s p. i could have easily gotten the xs. the dress hits in slightly lower on my thigh than what is seen on the model.
This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.
Probably not for everyone but boy do i love it and i've gotten loads of compliments on it! looks best with skinny jeans  would be good with leggings also.  i am 5'7"  155# and bought a size 10  fits perfectly!
These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however  it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price.
These are a bit oversized  order a size down. they are a nice weight and look great under tunics.
I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week  but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm  no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b  weigh 110 pounds  5'3" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!
The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.
I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.
I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things  and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back! i tend to wear medium shirts and large jackets/coats to fit my long arms  and the sleeves are a great length for me. the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too. the buttons were difficult to button at first  but became easier over time as the fabric softened. i also bought a pilcro skirt and it's comfortable too  so overall i&#39;m very happy with this brand.
I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding  and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress  the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.
Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me. :-(
I bought 3 shirts in gold  black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.
Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle  comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w
I love the style of this top  and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty  and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes  unfortunately they cut the armholes really big  so when you put your arms forward  the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway  but for $98 dollars i thin
I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.
Great dress  received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.
Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.
I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful  but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode  or small chested  it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft  true fit  and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'
I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.
I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately  there were no "petites" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored.
Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.
I am normally a size m  sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs  but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(
I saw this classic beauty on a mannequin with black trousers  and it looks gorgeous so i went back to try it on! looks better on vs on the table i have broad shoulders and the small worked
I personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses.  it meets my needs.  i personally recommend it to customers.
I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
Love this dress! ordered a 0p and it fit perfectly.
This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too.
I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed  yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.
Love the colors and design  however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows  and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it.
It's comfortable and easy to wear with lots of styles.
This blouse is so beautiful - the collar  sleeves  material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer.    i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"  140lbs and busty...a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material.
I loved the look of this sweater  but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches  and loose threads throughout  and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.
I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5"  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st
I feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store. usually  i feel bailey 44 dresses make my body look really round and short. i've passed up a few because i didn't find them too flattering. i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences  but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person! it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape! i also saw all the possibilities it had. the store had it styled with a denim jacket. i can
I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don't need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they're a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn't look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven't decided yet if i'm keeping or returning.
Love these jeans. comfortable fit  doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up  lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes
A nice alternative to jeans  good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.
For once  the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.  for me (5'3"  32e  125 lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8  but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).  the dress is co
Love the look of this and the fabric  but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0  then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
In a sea of dresses  this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape  and ended up trying both the medium and the large  taking the medium home. it was super flattering on  and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.  here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving  i put it on  and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.
I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.
I understand the style of this dress is "swing"  but there is just so much fabric  and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested  because there is no waist  it falls out from the bustline. cute dress  but i would size down.
I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on  and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft  the pattern is subtle plaid  and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod
I ordered a medium in these  and they were *just* too small for me. i'm a 12  so i was pushing it. there is no room for thighs.. :( but the material is great and the styling is fun. the length seemed ok for me  too. (i'm 5'9") hoping when i return them they have a large for me to exchange for
I somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons. it looks fine on  i'm just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath (why i got it). otherwise  just as pictured. i'm 5'7" 125 lbs and got an xs.
I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w
I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well.   i'm 5'1 and and 103. i got an xs and it fits perfectly.
Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.
This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy  perfect for a fall outfit.
I absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother  and ordered a 29 in these.
Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made  but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews  and it's too large  and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick  (5'5  105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips  making me look a little curvier  which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing  and this piece will spruce up most outfits !
These pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark  solid colored pants. the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold. the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable. i i'm petite (5'2") but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length. they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldn't have ended up cropped on me. having said that  i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened. i usually s
I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.
It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.
I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful  stylish in my own style.
I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.
Quite cute  it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.
I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.
I agree with the other reviewers. i ordered 2 of these but had to return both because the zippers didn't work. when i returned them  the saleslady said many people had problems with them.
I was so sad to have to return these pilcro jeans. my calves are just too athletic for these jeans. they weren't comfortable. they were a little loose in the waist. so  sizing up  would not have fit the tight in the calves problem. i have two pairs of stetson crop flares and they fit perfectly. in fact i love the pilcro stetson crop flare style. wish retailer would sell more of this style.
I like the style  but i ordered an extra small (i am5'4' 120#) and it was still too loose fitting on me  had to return  hopefully exchange for xxs
This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom  making it very flattering. lots of compliments!
I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type  which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame  but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.
I ordered this on a whim  not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1  110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.
Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!
I'm 5' 5"  150 lbs  32dd  normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast.
This sweater jacket is beautiful!  i wasn't going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy  but i am so glad i did.  it's super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.  i have a petite frame  and it doesn't look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do.  totally recommend this one!
I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral  vertical  slimming  goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in  the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr
Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel
I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the "fleece" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last
Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip  though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9".
Great print  terrible quality. the material is paper thin. not at all what i look for in a robe. it's going back.
This is a fantastic sweater--really soft  great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer  and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose)  but when my arms are lifted out to either side  it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one.
I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still
I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did  it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.    very bummed  but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers
I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it  so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!
I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large  but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of "padding" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"  130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu
This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee
I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however  in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt  at least on me. it was oddly shapeless  even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c
I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn  quite obviously  inside out. only after i received the navy shirt  where it is extremely obvious  did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but  because i love the style and the fit  i kept it.
No  no  no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7"  about 145  32c  usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the
I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift  blouson when cinched  or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads  sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d
Just received pants and even though they are labeled "petite" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26  which is not what the description states.
I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges  so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous  and not too big! the quality is fabulous  and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!
Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty  complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.
This top is so comfortable to wear. the way that it hangs makes it as light as air. wonderful for hot weather. the pattern is beautiful!
This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.
I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully  the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also  there were a lot of thread h
I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.
These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans  not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.
Flattering poncho  pair well with leggings or skinny jeans and booties
I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.
It's not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.
I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful  but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch  but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
I was excited to receive this top because i love the design  but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
I purchased my wife this shirt for christmas and she loved it! the quality of the shirt is amazing and now she wants them in every color! even though she says she's kidding  i really know that she isn't.! :#  the information i fill out #below) is about my wife  not me!
Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.
I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"  140lbs  36d  39" hips. i'd need an xl.
Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit. i ended up buying the rust color online too! i'm 5'3" 125 and i went down a size to a 26. cause they will stretch a little. perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots.
Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights
This top is really cute but shorter in length than expected.  plus  it shrunk considerably!
I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b
This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.
So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small  didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine  has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6  5'8" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!
This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it
Was super excited to try this on  but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
This fit great. i am 5'8 and 130 lbs. i ordered a size medium and it fit perfect. i wore a black tank/cami underneath for warmth in the office.
I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!
Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!
I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n
This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
Nice skirt. texture pattern gives it character. does run a bit large.
Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso  and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that  the material is a very good qu
Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.
After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand  i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights  clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
These are huuuuge! i'm 5'8" 117lbs. i ordered the small  but unfortunately they were way to big. i might have tried the xs  however didn't care for the pattern as much as the picture. i think these would work better on taller fuller figure girls.
I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.
I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful  bright colors; tried it on  and it was becoming  comfortable  and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago  have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.
Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs  and 4 was the smallest size available  so i ordered it. when i opened it  it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.
The shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.
Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.
I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho  and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger  but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body  which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer 'shell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy  but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about 2 inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p
I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant!   for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.  the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one
I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced.
I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night  for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!
I tried this on  the fit was true to size  as far as no cup size goes (32dd  got xs  was ok). the pattern i like  and was totally fine on my pale skin  but think of it  i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too  i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it  but i jsut don't "need" it right this second... dilemma.  caveat: not been tested in a workout  obviously  since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale).
This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season. flattering  casual look. well made light material. easy to dress up or down. can't wait to wear it again!
I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame.
This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.
I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit  but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!
I wanted to love this blouse  but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty  so the placement of the peplum just didn't work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size  but the peplum just didn't work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.
Those are very cute and lavender color is very beautiful in person  however i do not like the cut. waist goes about inch higher than usual pilcro  which for summer heat is something i do not find neither practical nor pretty and unfortunately i have to send them back : (. also  this year pilcro runs little bit tighter in waist than usual  so you might consider ordering one size up if you are between sizes.
Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..
Wanted to love this.. love rompers  but the opening between your chest was oddly designed  it was gapping and certainly couldn't bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full  made me feel frumpy..
Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.
Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim  not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the "bat wing" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material  it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft  to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible  "it
First  my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice  but stiff  so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting  but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me  not up to the usual ms standard.
I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha
I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c  127#. the moment i put it on  it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit  and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
This dress is a marvel. it's flattering and cute. it is great for work  a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer.
I am 5&#39;4  125-130lbs  c34 bust. i ordered this dress for a wedding in size 2 and it was too big! exchanged for the size 0 and it fits perfectly. order 1 size down  ladies!
Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline  armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.  i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo
Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order 1 size up and compare.
I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.
I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.
This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute  fashionable tights that aren't "heavy" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great  don't roll or bunch  don't shrink  have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!
This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!
I've been looking for colored pants and these are the best!    i am typically a 10 or 12 in pants and the 30 fit well. i tried on the rose color and loved those. the fit was great  though they wouldn't be long enough on me if i tried to unroll them (though you can). i liked how they fit my butt  hips and thighs  which is usually the most important part. i find that lots of colored pants accentuate the cellulite on my thighs too much  but that was not at all the case with these.    the fabric is
Love this top! so soft  fits perfect.
Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy  simple  but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9") and have broad shoulders and a long torso  and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your
This dress is light  airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan.   this dress is a keeper!
This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.
I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
Love this romper! it is beautifully made and classy. the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid. i'm 5'5" and 135 and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so. can't wait to where it.
Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.
I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes
Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy  too.
I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t
I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say  i won't be keeping the dress. the layers  fabric  and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.
Love this sweater. fun for fall. soft fabric and runs true to size. will look great with jeans or dress pants.
I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.
I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling
It's a fine dress  but it definitely runs small  and it's actually a lot shorter than i was expecting  especially since i'm only 5' 3"
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.    i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.    the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows.
The colors of this top are my favorite part  i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
I love the look of this dress & had high hopes  but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful  fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6"  155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide  so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small  but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang
I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin
I liked the product shots of this cardigan  but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting  the fabric was rougher  the lace was scratchy  the fit was boxy  and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute  but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale  but for now it goes back...
This is a beautiful shirt. dressy  imo. it's tts  i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black  white  moss  khaki  jeans  etc... love it.
Sadly  going back. ordered m  light color option  very difficult to pull over my head  not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle)  but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l  but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric  it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex "contrast"  which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle
Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.
This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer  i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"  usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash.
I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist  sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater  but it had to go back because it looked  um  used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned  sadly.
I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made  comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!
Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe  but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and  though feeling substantial  was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.
I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading
Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
I love this dress but sadly for me it didn't look good on my body type. i'm a 36 dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale. i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable.
Like another reviewer  i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length  the cut  the stripes  but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5"10" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally  i'm all for tailoring to fit  but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'
I like dresses with sleeves as those are more appropriate for work for me. this dress is a smooth material and the asymmetrical bottom adds just a little extra something. i got it in my normal size and i do find it looser/not meant to be body hugging again making it work appropriate.
I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.
I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it  there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno  nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short  and i'm 5'1". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist  or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it
This skirt ran short  small  and boxy. if you can get the right fit  the skirt is great quality and super cute  but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
This top may be right for some  but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however  it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl  but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big.     the quality is great and style so pretty  though. i wish it had worked for me!
I'm 5 ft 3 inches  130 lbs. this dress fits perfect! i bought a 4r. the petite 4 probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i don't the regular looked bad. it hits an inch or two below my knee. medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places. beautiful dress!!
I have never purchased printed pants before  but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on. i was impressed with the fabric  which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer. i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants i've tried  i had no trouble getting these over my legs! win win! i'm usually a size 8 and while it was fitted (not loose like on the model) i know they will stretch. being 5'4'' i'm just on the boarder of having mo
I don'tr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this  i would need a 6-7 inch heel for the petite version  which means regualr sized people should get petite. also  bigger  as in loose  i tried 0 and 2 and both ewre biggish (thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference). sales person told me to try 00  so we shall see... i will need to hem them if i kleep them though.  bronze color is very nice  so is balck  i ordered both for comparison.  lastly  cut is very flattering especiall
Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"  134 lb  34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.
I love the classy design and the little surprise bow in the back. i am 5'2" and about 107lbs  size 0 fit well. i was afraid it might be too short  but on me it is just above the knee. the bow on the back did not hide the bra strap on me  but the fabric is thick overall so that it can be worn without one. the fit is great once on  but it is a little hard to take off  since the zipper is not on the side so there is no relief in the arm/chest area. the color is beautiful  it's true to the pictures.
As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo  and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.  .  the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37  30d / 32c bra  with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the
What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately  this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly  the fit is slim  not relaxed. i'm 5'4"  at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally  the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece  however this w
For me  at 5'9"  the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length  it is cute.
This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats  and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a "swing" tank  but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size).
Adorable fall dress. but it runs huge -- i'm an hourglass 8 or 10 usually and the 6 fit best in the top and full skirt (36d  30 waist) but sadly each size the sleeves get like 2 inches shorter. since these are blouses sleeves they look off. so sad bc this dress is adorable otherwise. if you always find sleeves too long for you  snap up this gem  this is for you!
This top looks adorable in the product photos  so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off  but like another reviewer said  i found it to be like a tent on me  billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress  but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"  120 lbs and tried the xs.
I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..
These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!
These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size  which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair  but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now  that said  i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants  and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past  i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!
If you look closely at the photos  the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved  navy blue cardig
This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.
Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile  as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short  be prepared to have the hem taken up.     worth the buy!
My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.
I was disappointed in the blue color of this skirt. i was looking for white. also felt it ran a little big.
I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2"  34b  tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on  it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store 
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.
I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5"and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other "real" sweaters i have.
I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.
I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.
Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but  they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem  but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also  while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest  almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel  this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes  i would order down.
Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).
The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.
This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.
The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.
I bought this dress in three different patterns  i love it so much! i am 5'7" and around 135 pounds. usually a size six or eight in dresses. ordered the small and fits perfectly if a little bit. curvy frame. great for women on the busty side. fits beautiful and is stretchy but not too clingy.
I got the black in size small. i love this easy  breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer.     i'm a size 2 and bought a small.
Super itchy! had to return.
I love pilcro jeans.  i have many pairs and usually i'm a 31.  the sales girl said to buy them a size smaller because they stretch out.  i should have listen.  wore them one day and totally bagged out.  hopefully they will shrink in the wash.
This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.     fit: 130lbs/34c/5'6" high waist. i'm a 4 or 6 at retailer depending on the brand. in most mou
I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"  115lbs i prefe
This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.
I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.
Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on  which is a first. was very cute in theory  but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'4 and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!
Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3" and 130 lbs  size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!
This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!
This dress looked gorgeous  light and lacy in the picture  but when it arrived  the "lace" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy  sequined material. it was uncomfortable  scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress  so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si
This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
I've worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldn't be happier with it. this dress is extremely flattering. i usually wear a size 12  but i returned the dress for a size 10 which fit perfectly. the exact same dress  but in a different color was being sold at another major store. the other color wasn't nearly as flattering (but still cute) and the price was comparable.
I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.
Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!
I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.
This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture  but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.
This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.
Echoing others' remarks  this top runs large/wide (wise to size down). the embroidery is beautiful and for the volume of work  this arrived with minimal to no loose threads. however  i was bit disappointed by the mixed cotton textures - most of the top is a knit  tshirt like textures  while the bottom hem (with the horizontal stripe embroidery) is a stiffer  thinner woven cotton that i had thought would be the material for the whole shirt. the mixtures of textures and predominant knit textile ma
Warm and cozy tights for my daughter  she loves them!
I don't normally write reviews  but this shirt was so terrible  that i felt inspired.     first off  the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly  there is no shape whatsoever  unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall  this shirt is an insult to the female form.     retailer  what is with all of these shapeless  frocks in cheap f
The fabric is too sheer  also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly  it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest  then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b  this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!
The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.
First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas  but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall  if you're considering this jacket  take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.
This top is all around great for summer... i've worn it to festivals  for casual workwear  etc. love the colors  they're vibrant. this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it.
I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats. this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer 33-34" inseam. this style is a bit shorter- however  with the lighter fabric  i wouldn't want it touching the ground. pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf. call me old fashioned  but all pants should be lined! the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist.
This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.
I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?
I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
I ordered these jeans in size 30  and it was a perfect fit. i love the extra stretch in these jeans. will definitely be wearing them all summer long.
I adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.
The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.
For me  this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
5'7"  34c  28 jeans  4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist  but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey  but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned  i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color  transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh
I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.
It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water  line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water
I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great  and the overall look is so lovely. however  i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also  the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however  the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes  so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.
But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off  but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
I love this pretty sweater. i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs. the length was perfect- just below the hips. the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit. this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants. the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special.
This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.
I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.
I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back  because i'm short  but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable  casual  girly  and well made. i'm happy with it.
I am 5'-7" and 135 lbs  i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees  instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length...
Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.
I love these pants! they really make you look and feel classy. i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit! it is flattering  beautiful and oh so comfy! true to size 
Would recommend  but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over  even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5" 120lbs narrow hips  usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned  plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow  the material is really nice  soft and comfy  color was good (i ordered the dark)  and i could imagine they would be super cute
I bought this mostly to wear around the house  so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.  that said  this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose  and it doesn't really hang well over my hips  which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy  which is nice  but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling  bu
Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid  but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned 
As soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one  but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring  summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!
Bought this shirt in mid-july  washed twice (cold  delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart
I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky!
I love this tee  it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders  a good v-neck  and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.
Luckily i found this in the store though it is on backorder online  so if you really want it - go to/call the store. it's effortless  fun  beautiful  and nicely detailed. love this top. i'm 5'5" and usually wear size 6  and i bought a small. really worth the price b/c you can just throw it on and look fabulous. layers well. so happy i got this.
This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple  which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
I'll start with what i loved  this dress is made with a really beautiful  quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b
Love this  but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory  winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do  really it's not.    that said  i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right 
I find these to be nearly perfect. the quality is idea--soft  yet sturdy. the stitching is unique based on the color--which i love. and while they're super machine-washable  i never need to iron them for a business-casual look. i tend to like things on the baggy side  so as a 5'7" gal with about 120 pounds on me  i wear a 28  but i'm sure a fitted look would be more appealing to most. that said  i often get larger because they're a tiny bit shorter than i like  so i wear them kinda low. and if i
Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft
This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck  the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.
I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
I bought this shirt because i needed something lighter to where in autumn and needed to layer. i wasn't expecting so much out of a tshirt. the material is great. it's comfy and oh so flattering on any figure. i ordered the green one  and it was greener in person than online  but a very lovely color. it layers great  and is longer than expected. almost dress length. i'm not a tights wearer  but it would definitely go great with tights or leggings  and it worked fabulously under a wrap. great prod
Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now  spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically  there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust  and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus  the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all  a flattering better-than-basic sweater.
Love these pants. ordered in petite . love style  great fit but so long .   keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.   decided to order the black & green as well.
I am 5'7  the length is perfect  i can wear it with flat. normally the wide leg pants are so long  i have to wear high heels. the flow is perfect too.
I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.
I am 5'4" 120lbs  got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy  great quality  unfortunate design. not worth the money.
Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.
This shirt is comfortable  loose  but doesn't make you look like you're shapeless. it compliments.
I **love** this dress. it's definitely an investment  but well worth the price! i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it  and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events.
A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters  i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath  which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.
I love this sweater jacket! found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer! i am 5 4' inches and 34dd chest and curvy 145 lbs. the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item. the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink. i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones. i paired it with a pink blouse from anth
This is such a cute sweater! i wouldn't really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves. it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering. i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white.... red  black  or navy would have been perfect!
I purchased this dress in my usual petite size 2. it fit me quite well for the most part  a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress. there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area (i'm small chested). also  the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap (below the bow) which made me think i needed to size up. i'm not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end. the
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.
Very cozy lounge tee  but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
I didn't love it enough to buy it  but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
I love so much about it... it really is a gorgeous piece!  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve... there's something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small  or shrunk it in the dryer =0  i'm the only one commenting on that  so it must be me. lol. i think i'm going to begrudgingly return this one :(
This was my go to dress this past summer. so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges. perfect to dress up or down.
I bought this top in all colors as i love it so much! it is lightweight and perfect for our hot/humid summers. i actually wear the top backwards because the front of the top is longer that the back. to me it looked stranger to have it longer in the front! size wise  i think this top runs pretty large. i am usually a medium in most tops  sometimes a small  and i purchased this in a small petite. it fits great. i even tried on the xs petite and while it still fit in armpits and chest  it was just
I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
I saw that there was metallic detail when i ordered it  but i wasn't prepared for the entire thing to be metallic. it fit tts  but wasn't what i was looking for.
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings  jeans  or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!
I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!
Out of stock so quickly in my size. please restock!
I ordered this dress  expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large  except in the bust which fit well.
I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea  but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on. ---------- these fit tts  and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me. ---------- as an aside  these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss
I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops  i am 5'8''  150 lbs  athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size  definitely recommend!!
I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one! i love it and can't wait to get it back from the dry cleaner. the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable. it has pockets which is also a bonus.  i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much.
I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot  especially the front macrame part  but for me it did not work at all. also  too expensive for a tee.
Very nice material  soft and feminine colors. however  the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great  but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.
I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
Very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times (cardigan  tights etc) difficult.
Bought this in navy. needed something comfortable  but able to dress up denim. this was perfect! wore it already and immediately got 2 complements. the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large. bought in medium. i'm 5'8" and 145 lbs. just washed it for first time. noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front. may have to steam to get wrinkles out  but still worth it.
I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad.      i love the style.  the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me)     now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the "red" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re
I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color  the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color  the design is off so have to return.
I "studied" this dress for weeks before i finally bought it. i am soooo glad i bought it. much more fabulous than the picture. soft  quality denim that is not too heavy for summer. very fitted on top. love the pockets and the torn hem.
It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.
These are absolutely beautiful pants. soft and wearable right away  but the other reviewer is right. if you are average or short  these will be way too long. they won't even look like cropped pants  just regular wide leg jeans. i am keeping them b/c i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter. it's disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other 90% of us  especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans. so... i guess i am di
This dress is an absolute win. i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabric's lightweight nature  and then i tried it on. such a good fit for my high waist  and the tie was super flattering. i love this with booties as i was wearing today  but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look. it's also the rare three season dress  with its cut and coloring working most of the year.  for sizing  i'd say it's true to size. i got my regular size s with no trouble with
I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant  it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.
The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.
Love this dress! it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable. i got the ps  but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose.
I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.
I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big  this is the sweater for you!
I wanted something for the hot summers here  and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design  short in the front  hitting an inch or two above the knee  but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward  and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin  and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers  it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight  but not the greatest quality
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.
I wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great! however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable. very disappointing. did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once.
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
Love this romper. fits perfectly  and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7  125 lbs  and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small  and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida  and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.
This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art  great quality  and super wearable for both work and play  and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting  i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise  i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it  and it looks
I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!
Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
These are a comfortable  flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans  so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!
This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.
I would never have noticed this from the product shot  it was on the one of a kind rack at my store. the open work that shows off your bralette or a cami is sexy and it has just the right amount of slouch. super comfy. i loved it. bought a medium.
I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing  since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly  so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design  but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.
I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online  but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy  heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"  i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt.
Got the petite size. dress is swing style  so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person  more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy  just pretty and different. nice silk (matte  not shiny).
I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i don't have to layer over a tank. also arm holes don't gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers  jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly.
This is a lovely skirt that fits well  but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also  it felt very static-y.
Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress  fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.
This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4" hourglass shape (32d  27 inch waist  size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a 4 regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee)  so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in
I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line  wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me  this jumpsuit was just
I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large  i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will  though.
I loved this dress and i am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.
I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides  and just below her hair  there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well  it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.
So this is a great tee  problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.
I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8" and about 160 lbs.
These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .
I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look  it has long sleeves  and the color is beautiful. i can't tell if there is sparkle in person  it looks like it on pictures  or holes... but regardless  love it. i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me  for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger  this is more a "classic" size  as in what i would have ordered in the past (this summer  i had to go down in size a lot). the fabric is c
I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house  they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
I saw this top online and ordered immediately!  i loved the color  lace  and unique details.  sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!  the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly  and is very rough against your skin.  the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way. .....  that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.  it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a
This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon  and that's the problem i think.  i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck  it was a bit l
This dress is stretchy and soft  a great length  and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body  but it certain flattered mine.
Nice warm long cardigan that can work for many seasons. works well over a dress.
The design of this top and colors are amazing! the only complaint i have is that it is quite large. i should have sized down. needless to say i kept it as a summer to fall transition piece!
Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long  stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink  but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large  hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle  but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.
This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
This is a very pretty dress and looks just as it's pictured.  however  there is a lot of fabric - the lower half is very full and runs very large.
I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.
This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great  the fit is very forgiving  and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.
The prima is soft and silky. they fit true to size  maybe a little tight in the waist. while the color is more of a wine it looks nice with a lot of my fall blouses and sweaters. you will be pleased with this purchase.
This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously  i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress "sack" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.
This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy  and i am by no means overweight  but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c  5 feet  115). honestly  it just made me look fat. the design is cute  but this is going back..
I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
Was worried these pants would make my 5'2" frame appear even shorter  but no  they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand  but will remember this brand for the future.
Love  love this top. it is soft  comfortable  and cute. it is versatile (e.g. i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans). the tie at the neck adds a cute detail (if you want it tied). great staple for the wardrobe. i purchased in the black and it is very versatile  not sure how i feel about the print...
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!
Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.
I first tried this dress in my usual size 4  and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering.  i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a 2  and it was so much better!  very pretty shape.  uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size.  for reference  i'm 5'6"  125 lbs.
I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
I love the colors in this top  but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare  and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed  and sadly will be returning this. for reference  i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops  but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!
Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
I ordered these in m (5'8" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore  these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white  at that)  so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature
The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also  it runs small and was tight.
I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!
This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.
Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.
I am 5'4"  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event.
I love pilcros and tried everything to get these to work. one size down  two sizes down  no matter what  they just don't look right. the droopy look didn't work for me.
This is such a cute little top that can be easily worn off the shoulder or on the shoulders. it is comfortable  soft and quite flattering. it hangs nicely and is a pretty white top that will come in handy this spring and summer. i stayed tts on this one but could have sized down.
I'm glad i saw this item in stores  otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp  and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable  and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!
I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
A great little dress that can be dressed up or down.
I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however  it doesn't even cover my butt  that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"  i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.
I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside  it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large  but since it's a flannel romper  not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!
I bought the white tee. while the print is nice  the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
Love the feel and comfort
The material is super soft and the color is spot on. i have red hair  so purchasing a top in any red tone can be iffy...great transitional top for spring  summer and fall seasons! i accidentally dried mine  (thankfully only on the lowest heat setting) and it shrunk  but just the length a bit. one of my fave retailer purchases.
Color of the dress matches color on my monitor. the neckline is sheer. i am 5'4"  125 lbs  32d and ordered a size 6. i thought it fit perfect. this is a great spring/summer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look. it can also be worm with tennis shoes (white converse are my choice) for a more casual look.    i think this dress could also transition to a fall/winter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan.     also  i love the pockets  though i do see ho
I didn't want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona  so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale  i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown  copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook
This is one of my new favorite dresses!! i ordered this in pink  and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model. it's more of a reddish color. the dress hugs my body in a flattering way. i'm a 34b and the dress fits very comfortably  but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust. i'm usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove. it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant. i can't wait to wear this out!!
I agree with others that the shape is not perfect  it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect  sleeve were not too tights. (30dd  26.5 in waist  35 in hips  115 lbs)  colors are subdued  making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later...
I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.
Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!
I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.
I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it  it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
The lace on this top is pretty  and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos  but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front  it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5"--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well  and because the top was boxy already  i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"  120 lbs).
I bought the orange in xxs petite  and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.    i like a swing style  but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer  and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.
I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful  i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though  just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down.
First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t
So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~
This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it)     it fits me nicely  the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said  i'm 5'5" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for 1 s
So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : )
The dark orange is a beautiful color. this is a very comfortable dress  lightweight  long enough so you can sit down in it without any concerns. unfortunately  it's dry clean only  and you may want a belt to cover the elastic waist. the top part is very loose  so this might work better for full-figured gals.
I am super-pleased with this cardigan  which is at a terrific sale price. i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago  and i loved the feel of the material but wasn't sure about the color for me. when i saw they had a neutral striped version online  i decided to get it. the material is very soft and the beige/neutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone. the front is double-layered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an "unfinished" trim whi
An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the "yes i'm buying right now" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale  i am buying more colors.
I like what they were going for here  and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back "keyhole" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras  and the very wide neck also shows bra straps  so unless i want to go with a strapless bra  it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without  but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb
I have a gala to go to wear i am a board member. i had been eyeing this dress online and tried it in store! lurve! i got the black one which is a black lace over a sheer cotton nude  i also got the regular when i am petite as it hit longer for a black tie event. i have a large bust at 5'2" size d  but small and short torso and the large just hugged the girls just right. i love the it can be worn fancy with block heels to a gala or wit ha jean jacket or espradilles for a casual summer night. this
I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair  and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time  i went for the red pair  and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.
This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7"  140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end  it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.
I had been eyeing this top online  decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic! i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference  i am 5'7" and 139 pds  small busted  and i bought a size 6  fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!
Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately  the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small  as this coat appears slightly more snug on top  a-line on the bottom  with three buttons.  i am 5'6" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back.
This dress is so comfortable and looks so good. i love the low back and the swing in the skirt. i ordered the tangerine  which is really more red than orange. this is a simple  slip-on dress  perfect for traveling as it doesn't wrinkle. i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives.
Imo this top does run small. arms were tight in the size xs and just a bit snug in the s. top is definitely versatile. i don't usually wear peplum tops due a larger chest (34d-dd) and they usually look like maternity tops on me  however this one did not. the problem with this top is the fabric in the back of the top is shearer than i'd like. you can see every bulge and bump of your bra. i felt you'd need to cover your back with either long hair  jacket  vest or cardigan. not a deal breaker becau
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!
The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews  but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4".
Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.
I got these in the neutral color & quickly understood why they're categorized as "loungewear". if you're going to wear them out of the house  wear a tunic or a dress over them. i folded the scrunch part up over my calves & wore them like boot socks when i went out. i got a m/l & they fit about on par with other leggings / tights of that size range.  when i got home  i rolled them down & put the bottoms over my heels. the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles. i recommend them for around
Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable  the length is great  and the rise  at least for me  is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro.
Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.
These are nice  flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker  bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are
The blouse is lovely - but after washing it exactly as specified  it shrank more than a full size. this is an expensive hand-me-down for my daughter...
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms  and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket  but it's just too sloppy.
Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes  contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex  and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters  sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am  this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets
I'm 5'3" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6  but could tell that even if i had the 4  the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice  with a fitted slip design.
Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.
This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!
Another wonderful deletta top is hanging in my closet! i love the cotton. i love the style. medium fit perfect. it is loose around the middle  so soft and comfortable. i purchased the lavender washout. i know i will be wearing this frequently.
But like other reviewers said  it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3" and 110 lbs  i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material  it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this  but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed  because the material is beautiful and i lo
I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
This midi skirt arrived and i tried it on immediately. the fit was perfect and i wanted it badly enough to say that it would balance my 5'5" height and 135 lbs. if i just wore a higher heel shoe. then i saw the grey lining showing from the back of the skirt through the scalloped front. it's a beautiful skirt  flows nicely and could be flattering on a taller person who can forgive a poorly designed lining. i would recommend giving it a try.
Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!
These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand  mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever  i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small.   i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
Cute jeans  but they hit me a little higher on the calf than i would like so sadly i will be returning them.
This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.
I bough this in the blue green color and it's absolutely beautiful -- just as it appears online. actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online -- it's fitted up top and flowy everywhere else. this may be because i'm fairly straight-figured -- it's possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust. i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily. i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s  and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits. note: in meadow rue
I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way  especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous  especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry
I have to say  this sweater is gorgeous!!! i bought it in the green motif and absolutely loved the variety of colors used. i just didn't like the fit. it was so... blah. i felt like an old lady wearing it... it really had no flare to it... it was pretty boxy and boring :( so  very unfortunately  this one went back. way too much $$$ to not be in love w/it!
So  i bought these in 31 --my regular size in hei-hei and they were huge. so  now i am not sure if i should go for a 30 or 29? i guess i will try the 30. they are really soft and very cute pants. just the sizing is difficult.
Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me  so the size was good in this  too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short  but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black  too.
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)
I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me  there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft  although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok  the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body  it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there  it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!
I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5'10" frame than it falls on the model  between my belly button and hip  and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though  so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.  the quality of the knit seems nice  however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i
What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store  which makes sense because if it were hung it up  fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many "clothes" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made  so thin with cloth  that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes
Love this blouse  however upon every time i wear it  a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!
I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top  and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas  the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings  i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.
This top is really cute and the cap sleeves are perfect -- what i didn't notice from the online photos is that the back of the neckline is also scalloped which is a really sweet detail! however  i thought this t was a little tight through the chest (and i'm only a b cup!) and the fit was a little too boxy. the length was also just a bit wrong for my waistline/hips and in general  reminded me of the tops i used to buy from a popular british clothing catalog. overall  the quality is beautiful and
I love this top. i am 5'8"  135  36d  ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long  but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!
I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.
This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.
First off  the dress quality is great  the fabric is very nice  the color is great. i am 5'4"  150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me  very unattractive  because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant.
This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!
I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.
I found the color to be a bit blah  and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also  because of its "chunkiness " it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model.
I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you  as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all  and while there is a bow in the back  the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review  but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top  not something special like the picture is o
I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
So  ordered online. tried this on  boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.   back it goes. super cute but huge.
This dress is very flattering and tts. i bought this dress for my brother's wedding at the end of june. i love that it is machine washable  which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another. as another reviewer already mentioned  it is brighter than photographed.
This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9"  140 lbs and a size 4 fit perfectly.
I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person  and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring  summer  or even fall with a cardigan.
Super cute retro styling and i adore the pattern however i had some fit issues that were worth noting. i tried the standard 6 on at my local store but the bodice was so tight on my 34 b chest. i was determined to get this lovely summer frock and had the sa order an 8p to be shipped to me. i'm currently taking my 8p for a spin today but only after some alterations: even through the dress was quite large in the bust  there was still the dreaded button gaping so i added 2 snaps in between some of t
These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. "one size" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.
Retailer is my favorite store!  they always have everything i want and more.  these pants are absolutely beautiful and intricate in design and the quality is fantastic.  it's stylish and a pair of pants that i will always use and that will last for anlobn time. and how can i forget  these pants are slimming
I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
This is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front. gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking. however  if you have "shapely" hips and back-side  this will definitely emphasize that. had to take it back. a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events. however  if you're less endowed in that area  it might work well. gives a great shape!
This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers  i like the petal hem and the top part  which is stretchy  is soft and not clingy.     i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.    i'll be wearing this way into the fall!
Uhm no. oh dear  no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric  the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy  oh boy was i right. sadly  this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top  though.
Great shorts. i've been buying these for the past few years. each year  i add to my collection with new colors. i have 8 pairs now! perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg.
Wow  that dress is short... at least  the epite was  not falttering on muscular thighs... perhaps a regualr size on that one would work  but the bodice was a perfect fit  so not sure there... i decided not to try it on  as i figured this dress is very seasonal  and trendy. otherwise  if you ahve the money to spare and leaner legs i would recommend it. the cut was actualyl flattering otherwise  i didn't have bunching issues like others  and my 30dd boobs fit in the 0p. color and pattern are prett
The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.
I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish  modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored  conservative  and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs  i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is "blah"  average.  the material is textures and crinkly  not slick. the top is cream/ivory color
This is that one special  whimsical beauty that you hope to open on christmas morning. super comfy  not at all itchy and the pattern and colors are super stunning. even more vivid in person. i've never seen anything quite like it! very eye catching and oozing for compliments. can be dressed up or down  quite easily. very warm  and surprisingly true to size  even with the m/l combo. i'd say definitely worth the price..it is expensive  but this heirloom worthy piece is worth the splurge.
The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality  then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit  i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!
They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
This feels so nice and light and summery. nothing like a crisp white top for the season.
This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
I disagree with the reviewer that says these are more straight-legged. for me they fit tight throughout. sits perfectly on the waist with just enough stretch  but they still look very structured. i'm 5'0  110 lbs and the 26 fit me perfectly. the length was perfect for my height. often pants are too loose in the ankle for me  but these are snug and perfect to wear with booties.
This is a lovely top. received many compliments. felt very feminine  and perfect for chilly spring. please take this to the dry cleaners  you will avoid feeling distraught as i did after washing it  which is the recommended method to clean it  and seeing it shrunk to half it's previous size. sad.
This is an intriguing looking skirt  with it's sharp diagonal and the "quilted" optic pattern front panel. it's a nice twist on a black pencil skirt. i've been wearing it with a longer  wrap sweater in the cold  but imagine that i'll be able to wear it into the spring and maybe even year round with lighter weight tops. the fabric is a little thin in the back and the diagonal doesn't lie as straight or look as sharp as i'd like but for the sale price i paid  i really shouldn't complain. it's also
Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.
I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.
Given the price  i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well  but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric.      i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale.
Thought this would be my goto fall "dressy sweathsirt." it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....
This shirt is so soft and lovely  i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage  but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is  but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however  i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke
I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through  so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.
I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?
Love this top  the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great  not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well  not tight and isn't baggy  the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.
Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material  so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.
Really cute top  comfy  with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit  or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact  maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle  but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large  but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have   a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material   like cotton versus polyester  but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.
It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it  but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.
I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp)  so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual  it gives a nice "dress-up" kick to any jeans  shorts  capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate  :-)
I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.
Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight  while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6" and the size 6 is perfect for me.
I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it  but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall  i am slig
This dress was adorable. i found it to be a little too short for my taste- i'm 5'9"  and it hit mid thigh. i think you would probably see my rear if there were the slightest breeze  but it would be perfect on some shorter. embroidery was beautiful  and i loved the collar.  also a little sheer  but with nude colored under garments  it would've been fine. definitely try it out!
I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full
Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.
This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft  but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good  and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend "cold shoulder" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately  this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option  but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo
This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however  i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.
I saw this dress and fell in love right away! this is right up my alley  super comfy  perfect fit and love the stud detail. can't wait to wear!
Customers beware  there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.
I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi
I so wanted this top in red  and tried on the 0  but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5" frame #115 lbs  30dd#  i tried ordering 0petite  but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color  so i decided to try it  even though i am very pale... well  i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red  but it is super flattering  and the color is actually classy ... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit  not just casual. i love the feel  the fabric is airy  great
Love it to layer. it is not heavy the perfect weight & soft material. my daughters all want to steal it!
Very interesting material.  the very subtle/light window pane pattern is perfect.
I love the off the shoulder trend but don't like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe.
This is the perfect summer top! lightweight and breezy. looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose. loved the blue one  so i came back to get the red one. (i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual.)
I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large  but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!
I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height   weight  and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu
Tried this lovely with high waste  wide leg  black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more  but not quite!    size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small  occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5" tall  130 lbs  34d  35-29-37  long torso  narrow shoulders  and short arms.    fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t
These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral  and wore with a black peasant top  sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though  so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model  and after a few hours they were hanging off of me  so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.
Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!
I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect
Pros: soft  quality top  true to size  and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder    reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up  and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.    i'm 5'6"  normally a medium/8  and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures  so as an hour-glass shaped gal  i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a
Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it! 
Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer)  a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift  but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!
I am a huge pilcro fan. however  these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
In general  if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress  you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale  but it's a pass for now.
Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat  it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however  there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat  but more of a fun piece to dress u
I ordered this in blue  and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style  but i tried a few items on my last order  this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom  which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style  this item is good quality  soft  comfortable material  and a great spring or fall blue.
I love belted sweaters  but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple  but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom  can't even gegt them hemmed  what a bummer. my inseam is 27 inchess  so i would need a 5 inch heel. otherwise  gorgeous  and waiat fits true to size. thighs a bit snug for musclea  but stretchy enough to fit. thinking about keeping them  but have to find big plaform heeks...
Very cute shirt  well made  nice detail  but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
Beautiful shorts  good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you!
I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store.
Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.
I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from
This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said  great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.
Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black  like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well  albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9") and they run small. i sized up to a 6  when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out  sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them  and now they are good to go  but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first
I'm a stay at home mom  always on the lookout for something casual  interesting  yet put together. it's preppy yet quirky with the embroidery. i love this shirt. great with jeans  can take you from shopping to playground and lunch without feeling under or overdressed anywhere. the sparkle from the embroidered birds gives it spunk to not make it look too boring and predictable. at the same time  it isn't something that screams  look at me! a perfect mix.
I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.
Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more "square" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't
First off  this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely  i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews  i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however  i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm  which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.    i ordered size petite xxs
These pants are so soft and comfortable. i'm almost 5'6" and the hem completely covers my ankles but does stop short of bunching. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the waist. it's pretty high and a bit loose so every time i get up from sitting i'm having to pull my pants back up. other than that  love that it's something that can be dressed up or down.
I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is  unfortunately  more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well  but i bet it is lovely in navy.
These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"  they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable.
So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4" and size small hem fell about 1" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material  it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like "faux leather" since they
This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm  shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.
Fully lined until just above the knee  silk exterior  rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess  but am hoping it goes on sale.
This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.
I am 5'4" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect  and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron
I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick  in fact it is quite sheer for "velvet". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a  xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w
I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
I love this sweater tunic! the neckline adds interest and is so flattering. i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model. my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me :) it is soft and not itchy at all. i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots. i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to. this will definitely be a staple in
This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to "bloop" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't
I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
Many complements today at work! comfortable even on days you don't want to wear something form fitting
Love this cardigan! it is a really a sweet and sexy top. so flattering to curves and yet conceals too. the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy.
I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
The embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navy/grey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown. i'm 5'6 and tried an xs and small  the small definitely fit better in length. the body of thr blouse is loose  almost boxy. cute top  just not what i'm looking for.
These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down  which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.
Love love love this tunic. it has panels that don't really show up in the picture but the panels make it lay really nice. it's great over leggings and skinny jean cords. could even wear it with opaque tights. it's great for work  play or evening. i bought the navy blue with the heart print. i love it so much i'll probably get the green and the red when they go on sale. this is a pricey top. for reference i'm 5"3 128lbs. 32ddd fits great all the way around and the length is perfect - mid-thigh an
This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo. the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design. soft  flowing and flattering. definitely a keeper.
I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants. good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored. i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust. the arm holes are fitted nicely as well  no bra exposure. looks very nice on. on point for sure?.   (for reference i'm 5'5" 34dd  ruler shaped figure narrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer.)
This top is absolutely adorable  fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture  plain black. the back print is nice just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.
I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big  though. opt to size down.
Cute  but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!
I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year  i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently  try them on. the dress is worth the price.
Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
I am 5'8"  140lbs  pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly  just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic  and there is no unflattering poofing  which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw  however  is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it
I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!
Soft  cozy  and cute  but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only. for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money. i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs  but i was ok with it being looser.
I have been waiting for this poncho to hit my local retailer.  it was as good as it looks online. the perfect piece to put on over a tank or t-shirt. you can dress it up or down and i love that it has pockets. i wear a 10 and i bought the m/l  this is meant to be oversized so buy appropriately.
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best  tight in the hips  extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric  skip.
Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft  extremely flattering  and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference  and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple  for sure!
This piece is a great  easy throw on that allows you to still look polished. it's heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those in-between fall weather days when you don't want to lug a jacket around. lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear.
I love the green pattern. the fabric hangs and moves beautifully. thick enough to cover undergarments without slip or liner. ballet back is nice detail. i'm curvy and generally between s and m  s has a little room to spare. generally flattering piece. great for summer!
This top is cute  but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs  but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2"  110 lbs  34a). even worse  though  was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined  so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy  and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt  but not worth actually wearing.
I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine  stylish  and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.
This skirt is a real "dress up" piece. it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist. the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely. i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments
The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!
The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also  i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27  but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye?   i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.
Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference  i am 5'6  135lbs  34c  28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi
Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice  loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami  looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.
This top came down to my hip bones  but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for "regular" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice  and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing  i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model  but n
Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes  the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like "gumby the cartoon character"
I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this
Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty  but the shape isn't flattering  at least not to me. might work better on a teen?
Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however  only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say  i'm returning it.
Gorgeous dress! love that it's flowy  soft  and fits very well. it does run a size smaller. i usually wear a 4 and went with a 2p one this one. the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size.
I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
I'm 5'3" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well  but this one was weirdly big at the top
I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1"  so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me  but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!
This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.
This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across  which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.
I love the fit of these pants. 5 starts for that. i wish the pockets were a little closer together  but it's not the end of the world considering how well they fit. the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants i've had before. i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color. i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps. i would still recommend these pants  but wash them a couple times before you wear the
This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however  when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition  though i ordered a size medium  it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad  i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are  go for it  but get a size smaller than you normally would!
I loved the way this sweater was made.  my arms are really short so the sleeves were way too long and looked silly rolled.
I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"  130lbs  bought a large and it was way too big  but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection  especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves  and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down  but still love it.
I received this top in white  last fri.  and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.
This dress does run a tad small. for me it was small across the chest and i did have to shimmy into it. i am 5'6"  110 and got size s. if i had gotten the m it would have looked a tad frumpy (on me). pretty  but wasn't happy with the fit aside from that the "line"separating the top from the bottom was rather high for me and it seems that it was not really intended to be an "umpire" waist. i tried a belt with it and at my natural waist left the line uncovered several inches up toward my chest. i
Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d
I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.
Cute and simple top. a little tight through the bust. looks great tucked or out  and super cute with a simple jacket. easy piece to dress up or down.
I love this dress  the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled!   once i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!!
I was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing. for reference  i am 5' 2" / 105 lbs / 32a chest  with a thin but athletic build.  i love the feel of this shirt. it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape. because i don't have much of a chest  i do think it is a bit low-cut on me. i will probably wear a cami underneath next time.   it is a pretty  versatile dress up or down kind of piece  which is why i chose it. i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s
This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.
I'm 5'4"  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.
And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.
I love the idea of ruffles  but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium  and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes  it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer  but it's pretty thick.
This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
I wore this skirt immediately when my delivery arrived. nothing but compliments. i went right back to order the green and it has sold out. bummer - i would buy every. single. color. this skirt is that great!
Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
I'm 5'5" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!
I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3"/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!
I bought this top on a whim - it's not 100% my style  but wanted to try something different. the fabric and print are amazing! so unique  soft  subtle  and delicate. great fit as well. my only complaint is not the fault of the top  but if you have a bit of tummy  the fold at the peplum really brings it out so you'd have to wear high-waisted bottoms or suck it in. the hem is also really flowy  more so than shown in the pictures. theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath
Pretty color.  love the lace.  my husband thought it looked a little "old lady-ish"  but i think it depends on what you wear it with....  it's been too hot here to wear yet. i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings!
Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric  so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially  going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
I agree with the previous reviewer - the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online. i would not have bought it had i not seen it "in real life". this is a super cute  soft and comfortable shirt. it fits tts and can be worn with jeans  leggings or a skirt. for reference i'm 5"7 and 122 lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room.
I bought this dress in ivory and then bought the navy on sale  i loved it so much. i'm 5'4"  117  and the petite medium was perfect. love the kicky flare  and the lining makes it so comfortable. an effortless  fun dress - perfect for hot summer lunch.
This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.
I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.
I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos  and have purchased many pairs. however  the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved  although they have the exact same name. they are now "boy cut"  and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say "boy cut". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri
I bought this during a 20% off sale which made it even more worth the price. i would have purchased and kept it regardless  but just got lucky.  looking at the pictures online  i thought the coat was going to be red. however; when it showed up it is more purple. i still like the color and did end up keeping the coat.  i do think the buttons are sewn on well  but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost. these are very unique buttons so i can't imagine it woul
Pictures do not do justice to this beautiful piece of art. the embroidery and jewel detail is exquisite. just don't plan on holding any kids or pets  you won't want to snag it or them.
This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on  i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline  which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(
It's a beautiful top  but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though)  i fear it may easily rip.
These jeans! i tried these on  in addition to the high rise paige denim  and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother  with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs  but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!
I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic
Super soft  super cute but too short for a dress  too long and too overwhelming for a shirt  and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors  feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.
Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight  allows no room for extra tummy  hips  booty  or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top)  but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m  would have definitely sized up  as i really liked the look.
These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...
I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews  but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine  unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts  but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l  depending on the shirt (5'9  long torso  36c
The colors in the green shirt are beautiful  however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6" 120#  not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall  wispy   less curves...
I love this dress. i'm 6' so it's a tad bit shorter than what shows on the model. it stops right at my ankles  which i'm okay with. it's a heavier fabric so it's maybe not good for those really hot  humid days. all-in-all it is super flattering on my hourglass figure. for reference  i'm a 38dd and normally wear a large in dresses at retailer. i ordered the large.
I ordered the black and red check leggings thanks to the suggestion of the retailer stylists online. there is no way in a million years that i would have picked these out due to my body shape. i'm petite size 6 and 120 pounds and 5 feet tall. i ordered a petite small. i do not have skinny legs and ordered these anyway. they are so flattering that i'm thinking of ordering the grey pair. the red pair are kind of darker. the picture makes the red look so much bright than they really are. trust me  yo
This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there  however  it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types  but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling  comfortable top however.
This is a very cute shirt with great details. however  it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.
Love this shirt  it's so comfy for fall/ winter  but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!
This dress is made well; the construction/sewing details give the dress a beautiful shape. it has a nice zipper at the back  and fabric feels light. pockets are a good size. skirt flows  but doesn't feel heavy. fit is comfortable. i typically wear somewhere between a size 4/6. i ordered a 4 and it fits just right. i'm 5"6 and it falls below my knee--length is nice. armholes are a bit lower than i thought  but not too low. it's a classic/modern look. it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it 
The sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you're a genius.
Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas  the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body  but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.
I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.
I love this dress.....but  and it saddened me that there was a but; the material would wrinkle near the sleeves (fit issue) and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable. i ended up returning it  because at this price point  i need perfection. i would definitely recommend this dress  it just wasn't for me.
I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however  the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it  kind of chartreuse.    i returned the item because it didn't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me.
I love joggers  best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.
Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.
I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this  but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.
I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn't flattering on me.
I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated  modern  and flattering. i was surprised that the "dress" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay  which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape  but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks  and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it.
This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.
Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes
I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side  but on my 5'7" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!
This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price  this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose  so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though  it would be fine.
These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.
This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost  but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee  in my opinion.
I really like the look of this dress  but i ended up returning it because it was too short. the shoulder area was also too big on me.
I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute  but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.
This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.
This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!
Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large.  so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look  order down a size.
Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.
I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.
Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for  for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top  and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!
I think the model is wearing a larger size  per the first review. i am 5'2" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap  since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it.
This dress is very flattering  comfortable and made me feel pretty!
I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw
I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!
The length of these pants is not quite long enough. i'm 5'8  and the only way i can make these work is if they're pulled low on the hips. it'd be nice if more brands offered long and short sizes in lounge
I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp  still boxy.
Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those "special" pieces from retailer; elegant  quirky  sophisticated.  the details are great  too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r
This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry  a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight  true to size  drapes nicely and its very flattering. i"m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!
I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy  however  they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam  but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed.
The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4  which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips  but the shape worked well for my shape.
I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr
I love this fabric  and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3  and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much  but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out  for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.
I'm a big ag fan  so i was excited to receive these for my birthday. i really love everything about them  but boy were they long!! even with a 3 inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem. i'm 5'7"  so i don't often have to get things hemmed  but that was a must with these jeans. i recommend these jeans  but unless you're 6 foot tall  plan on running them to the tailors.
This is a really cute shirt. i love the design  color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs  i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering  though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr  tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30
I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot
Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.
I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now  i need more colors...
The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.
So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear  and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness  the rise  and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down.   i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!
I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer
Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.
Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.
This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf  and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish"  118#  34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre
The fabric is great and the cut is flattering. i have dds  so it pulls a little in the middle. you can just cut from the inside to release the pulling thread.
This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid  and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah  it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  hem falls 4 inches above my knees  sleeves fall right at my wrist  and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat  horse print is so cute.
I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret
I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length  slits  tie  stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas  it isn't meant to be...
This is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery. the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at 5"1  i like the length of the regular for myself. i'm 104 pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end. i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference.
This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale  and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!
Really cute skirt. found it to be too much material on my frame - 5'4. would look really great on someone taller. the tie in the front was pretty  but a bit bulky on me and ultimately i want a skirt i can wear both ways - with shirts tucked in or out. this one is tuck in only so sending back. will look really great on someone else though! nice knee length skirt.
Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico  but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however  when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit  but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length  but make sure you size down.
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.
I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be  but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.
I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different  awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy  athletic build  with broad shoulders and small waist  for your reference.
Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general  but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy  instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right  so you may want to size up.
Tts. i'm 38c  8-10 and m fits just right. nice and fitted at the top  flowy skirt. i got the cream and love the skirt pattern.
My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.
Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric  wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel "well dressed" in this top. i returned it.
I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty  beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.
I am 5'5"  145 lbs  a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer  in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print  and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an "off of the shoulder" design but it does not
I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front "collar" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.
This dress has a really elegant neckline combined with the wide fitted waist and under-the-bust gathers which really flatter the body. i have a fairly straight body and this dress gives me shape. i usually wear xspetite but the turquoise didn't come in petite and that was my preferred color. so i tried the xxs which i could barely get on and off but once on  it fit fine (34aa  26" waist  34" hips). i'd probably be better off with the xs. the length of the regular on me was fine  like a normal ma
Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....
This tunic is flattering and high quality  just be sure you size down!
I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said  it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly  albeit a little short. for reference  i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.
I ordered a medium  as i like my shirts a bit loose. it is a beautiful shirt  and looks great in person. however  this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean. exchanged for a small!
This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.
This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable  stylish  and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring  summer  and fall.
This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering  fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds  34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous  but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4  5'5" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it.
Nice sweater  just did not look good on me. sorry  going back.
The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.
I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"  114#  34b
I really like the appearance of this item  and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a "true to size" small  and this hangs on me a little  but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!
The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay  not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure  i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.
I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue  and wanted it. however  for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it  and by the time i did  only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived  and as i was trying it on  i thought  this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something  but n
I bought these immediately after trying them on. i was totally surprised to see these very cool  edgy pants at retailer. the color and details are spot on! great quality. i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in. i received a lot of compliments. these look like they should come from europe! i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants.
A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but  it does snag very easily. so far  i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black  which concentrates the black when snagged.
Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6  125 pounds  and the size 2 fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size 2 petite. definitely worth the money.
Purchased this t-shirt in white. it's lightweight and slightly sheer. perfect for layering. looks cute with a poncho  blazer or on it's own. really wish it was available in black.
I don't normally write reviews  but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus  they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5  135 and medium is perfect.
I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.
Sadly  this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch  my purse  my necklace. i had to go home  change  and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.
This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
First of all  the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms  honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also  with one important exception  the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent   which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown  in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
Love this shirt! looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans. very flattering with the banded hem  and the material is soft.
I bought this in the neutral motif  and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted  i guess you could order your normal size  but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath  i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look
So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.
I was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece. but i love them! they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans. they create the optical illusion that i am a super model  so i will wear them as often as possible. very flattering and comfy=win win!
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
Really wanted to love this top...it is beautiful with very good quality but...ran small and tight...also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward...
The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably  i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room  would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
I try to find something to like about everything i buy  even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt  but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch
I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it's trendy without trying too hard. nice lines  the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty  i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.
Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!
This is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it (delicate  cold water  line dry) it shrunk excessively in length. i'm very disappointed.
If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality  embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not  also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right  colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also looks great belted and much nicer in person.....
The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy  yet unshapely. after the initial wear  the product begins to stretch out  and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft  but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely  but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.
I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable  warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing  i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.
I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!
This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(
I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!
Love love love this dress! but  if you are not wearing a slip...you should be! please wear a slip  you can see right through this dress.
I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits  but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.    true to size.
This top is great for layering or by itself over skinny jeans or leggings! i'm 5'5 and this is the perfect length! ??????
I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great  so soft & comfy  but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me  it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top  but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model  this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!
I ordered the green top in store after trying on a medium that was huge. the small fits me well and i love the flowy style and softness of the fabric. i like it with skinny capri jeans and the color will transition well into fall. i'm in florida where it is still very hot in october. if you typically wear either a small or medium  order the small in this top.
This dress is beautiful in person  the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses  but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room  but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part  it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we
After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black
I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts  half tucked  and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering  it is a tiny bit sheer  but i was wearing a magenta bra  so perhaps i am biased. overall  i think this is a good basic addition  to a summer wardrobe  can be worn with a nice skirt  or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs  can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs  with 30dd chest.
This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the "see-through" issue that the other reviewer mentioned  my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.
I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color  length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these
This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.
I recently purchased this blouse in black. i love the soft yet crepe like fabric and the small bit of negative space trim just above the bust line gives it an air of elegance. comfortable and breathable  i see this becoming a "how did i live without this" staple.
I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that  but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them  because again  the fit! the style! alas  about the fifth time i wore them  the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo  but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
Even following the care label exactly  it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect  very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels  flats  or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.
I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.
This is a pretty sweater that is great for transitioning to fall. wear it sleeveless on throw a leather jacket over it for cooler nights. fights true to size. the gray is a very pretty color. great addition to my wardrobe!
The quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide.
I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality
Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'4 125 lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs  yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric  a bit stretc
I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite.
I am not someone who normally wears overalls (this is actually my first pair!) but i'm so glad that i took the plunge and bought these. they fit amazingly while being both perfectly trendy and perfectly timeless. if you are on the fence about overalls in general  these are a perfect first pair.    i'm a 25 in most denim brands and was also a 25 in these. the bottom portion fits perfectly and doesn't look sloppy (like i assumed overalls would be) at all! the top is perfectly casual.     i'm so ha
Awesomely different top. the first time i wore it i didn't wash it so it was big on me. it shrunk from washing so it fits better now. there is some unraveling of the frayed edges though.
Very nice but thin materal. very sheer. i paired with the palmarosa wide legs. loved the way it looked. i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt  though.
I'm glad the previous reviews had mentioned the dolman sleeves so i was better prepared for how it would fit. you do have to do some rearranging of the fabric  but it generally stays put and isn't bothersome. the neckline is a bit more structured than shown in the pictures  but it only adds to a more sophisticated look. great fabric and color as well.
I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it  love the print.
I love this shirt! it is classic and elegant. it is versatile and can go with lots of different things. be mindful  it is see-through so you must wear a tank underneath. i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down. i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt. definitely recommend.
I too  was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of
The sales girl added this to my room  it's so darling and it came home with me.
This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful  overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.
I got this in blue and also in white  both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does  so consider this when you order  depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way  definitely not with leggings.
Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the "v" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.
Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs  and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit  because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if
I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty
I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid
I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet  but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink.
I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp  white  but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami  and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.  anyhow  this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn  not buttoned up l
I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes
I love this pair to add some color to a plain outfit. however  they ran just a tad bigger than i expected.
I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise  you might like them. i can't comment on fit..
I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends  and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.
The fringe and fit were beautiful  but the lace with it (a little hard to see in the photo) seemed like an odd pairing -- just too much going on. returning . . . .
This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.
I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.
Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'4 with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.
First of all  the label on this dress is maeve  not nue by shani. second  i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny  which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall  i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.
As other reviews have mentioned  this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly  returned asap.
This is already sold out in petites and the reason for this is asymmetrical stripes: this is the most flattering design for tops. horizontal stripes only look good on people trying to look bigger and heavier. do you know anyone like that  b/c i don't! vertical stripes  while slimming  generally look a little severe  modern  weird (occasionally great)  while asymmetrical stripes knock 5lbs off a person. stock more asymmetrical striped tops  please!
Order yourself a pair today! my new favorite jean  especially for spring/summer. good color and very comfortable.
The fair-isle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick  but not itchy. the neckline is a perfect crew cut style- not too tight  but compliments the neck itself. the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans  blue or gray cords  etc. so many options!!!
I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs  as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.
I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.
This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long  but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!
These pants are very comfortable. the material is light  so they will be perfect for a warm spring day or a cool summer's night.
Love this jacket so much! so comfy and great for traveling. i love the fit and the way it wears 
I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color  but the fit was huge  no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose  but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color  but the execution left much to be desired.
I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2  125 pounds and usually  wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small  but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine  but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed  but it looks ok rolled up too.
This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top  like a dolman sleeve  but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top  which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric  no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms  might work for you. sending it back.
I got the ivory. it's very cute under the split back cloth & stone button down denim in slightly oversized top (i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down). this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium. the top snags easily. it 's pricey but i love it.
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
This top looks so pretty on the model. however  the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted  so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller  this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"  105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c
I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i"m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.
I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.
I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being "on" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle "ridge" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.
I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!
I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however  the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.
This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy  comfortable  stylish  and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down  the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red  but i think you could wear black boots with it  no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!
These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
Even though this shirt is incredibly thin  i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup  with white jeans in the summer  over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!
I love this dress. i'm 5'8"  160 lbs and have no hips  no butt and no waist. i have no curves and thin muscular legs. it's like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one. i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments.
1. i've been waiting forever for these to finally arrive. i was a bit disappointed.    2. i'm 5'5" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40. my normal size 30's fit me perfectly  if a bit loose. they fit a lot like the hyphens.    3. the legs are short and wide. they hit me at the ankle  which made them look like high waters on me.    4. the legs are very  very wide  and i didn't think that was flattering on me.    5. same comfy fabric and fit as the hyphens  except the front seemed to dip low at the waist i
Color is beautiful  fits perfectly  lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.
Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9" and thought it was cropped  boxy  and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer  more like a cardigan.
I really loved the material and the feel of this item  however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.
So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!
I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe  but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately  i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long  so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't
I purchased this in navy and love it. my only complaint is that is is a little big in the shoulders. i am about 5'4"  129 lbs and the small is still a bit too big. aside from that  it is a great design and length and i've worn it both with jeans and leggings / boots.
Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though  so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit  in fact.
Beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i'm not. going back.
Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses  thermals  henleys  blazers  etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly.
I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a "diamond" shape ;) large chest  moderate waist  large hips  and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either
This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look  or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed  but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy  i highly recommend!
Great leggings for the price. they are ultra soft and stretchy. a great pair of leggings to relax in. they are very stretchy and only come in 2 sizes s/m  l/xl. i am 5' tall and they fit fine  because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame. they are a bit long for a petite person  but tucked into boots and nobody will know.
This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store. i tried two sizes -- i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days -- and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness. the hooks and eyes pull a bit  but i won't be fastening this all the way to the top. the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out. the color is a dreamy pinky nude (more pink than nude)  an
I purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store. it is cozy and stylish-love the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck. i am 5'7" and 135 lbs and the s fit great. noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now! it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant  all the better  right??
I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it "might" be sort of cute. a comfy  flowy  warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room  including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store  and it still looked great! it is comfortable  loose  and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr
This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering  and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!
This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however  it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly  this is a deal breaker for me.
When i was purchasing this i asked to myself "do i really need another black jacket". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite.
This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the
This skirt is super cute and versatile. dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater  tights  and boots. i'd say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side; definitely doesn't run small. love it!
Alas  i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy  drapey  ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral  and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.     (i'm 5'6"  135 pounds  38-30-38  and i ordered a 10.)
This review will be shorter as i already wrote another one and it was never posted..  ----------  1) these are high quality jeans; the fabric weight is light enough you will be able to wear them year-round  ---  2) i am 5'8"  144 lbs  and the size 29 felt best on me; for this brand i typically wear a 28-29. i felt like the 29 was cut too narrow in the hips for my body type. for ref. i am athletic  with shoulders broader than hips. if you're unfamiliar with this brand know they do not use a lot o
I was so excited for this to come in the mail  once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive  it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
Unlike the first three reviews  i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.
I just love this blouse! it fits well and is really feminine and pretty. i paired it with a skirt and received lots of compliments!
First  thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this! it's so soft! gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies. for reference  i'm 5'5"  32dd  28  38. size xs/s was perfect.
This dress has potential  but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big  i ordered medium  my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9"). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit 
I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.
This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it  but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.
This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.
I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw
I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line  but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse.
This top is flowy and feminine. the pink is slightly more vivid than pictured online but is still a beautiful  soft pink (definitely not red). i was afraid the shape would be unflattering on my not-so-skinny figure but it's not. it's baggy all over  and there's plenty of room in the arms. note that dark pants/skirts will show through the fabric  so i like the shirt better with an untucked cami/tank top underneath it (so the gorgeous neckline isn't disturbed but the pink color runs true throughou
Cute top. agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person. the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful. it is a very full swing top  but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back. this isn't evident in the photo shown. i usually wear a sm in retailer tops  and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model  in fullness and especially in the arms. it's still cute enough to keep  but i personally probably could have gone down a size.
I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in.
These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.
I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo  so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person  the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate
I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.
I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
Tried on this maxi dress recently  hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.
Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this  and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit  as i have a large chest  and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8)  and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on  and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5"2')  so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference  i'm about 5'9". hope this helps!
This is a cute shirt  but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular "flap." it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.
So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft  and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5'5   125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won't regret. also   finally - perfect length .
This dress is gorgeous  but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.
I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!
This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy  comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.
The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4"  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.
Fun  flowy top! maybe be a little snug across the top for larger chested girls but this flares out into a light and airy dream to wear!
This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price  but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love  and this was it. great  light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.
The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me  i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan  tights  and boots as the weather gets cooler.
Stylish. great color. great fir in between weather.  may need shortening but constructed in a way that will make it easy.
I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large  however the arm/shoulder area is tight.
I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly  going back.
Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.
This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure  but since i've got curves/an athletic build  it simply did not work. too bad  because it is such a pretty dress!
I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice  but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl  but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.
This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!
The top falls nicely  great quality  the lace is beautiful. however  the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.
Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!
Contrary to what previous reviewers have said  i think this top fits really well  and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small  and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest  and i'm a 34d. (5'4"  124 lbs  36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue  however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po
Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.
I love this tunic. the knit is soft and comfortable and very easy to wear. i purchased "moss" and can change the look of the outfit by adding various accessories. the slits on the side are cut rather high and i have found that jeans or leggings of a thicker fabric look best.
Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.
I ordered a size large  however as a large  my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.
Tried the size small  regular. me: 5'6"  34/35a-28-36  straightish shape  broader shoulders.  it's described as slim fit but i found the small to be a loose fit on me. i would almost consider trying the xs if i wanted something less baggy...but i think the style is meant to be very laidback. i tried to picture the extra material i had.  the color is a lovely denim blue and the length on me was just as the website describes. deep v neck but not to the point where i feel i'd need a cami  those of
This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering  especially from the side  but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute  but a little transparent.
This top is much nicer than expected.....the fabric and style are great. i am a size small or medium  and got the small. from the front  it was great. not so much from the back for me. i'm larger on top than bottom and the 5% spandex made it too clingy around the dreaded bra fat area. i don't wear spanx. i wish retailer would be more specific with the fabric content. if i'd known it was 5% spandex  i would have ordered a size medium. i am thinking about doing this because the top is really
Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
It is a beautiful dress but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin.
I give this sweater a five star review. i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or white.this pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retailer.yes this sweater is extremely delicate  it didn't pull at all while i was trying it on. this will be a great transition sweater.
I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.
I love this dress! perfect with high boots. and the quality of fabric looks and feels great. fits just like it shows in the picture.  i am size 6 and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me. i like it a little looser for that boho look.
I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.
Ive been on the hunt for big bulky sweaters because winter is coming and i live in the north  i saw this sweater and needed to give it a try. i got it i the mail and its truly gorgeous and extremely well made. this is the type of sweater to wear on a cold snowy day. it runs a little big but thats okay with me because its perfect to snuggle up in. i love this sweater but be aware it is thick and bulky so its not made to make you look like a twig. i like big sweaters and this design flows from sma
This is a great piece  it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.
I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful  as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey  but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it  it's well worth it.
I am petite and ordered size small  and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice  but in terms of the waist and length size  both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all  and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item  unfortunately.
A 3-season top that compliments jeans  dress pants  shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders  length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.
It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review  it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too.
I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.
Looks great on the model  but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size  they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in  but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns  and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a
These are the very stretchy  almost spongy  type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy  casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.
I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely  but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned  this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well  i also didn't love the collar  which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po
This is a beautiful top. it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option. i highly recommend it. it runs true to size. the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well!
I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.
The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.
This dress was built for my body to disguise it's flaws. i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered  busty  with a tummy pooch and no hips. this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer. received the package today and am wearing it right now  i'm so happy! i ordered size 10  my stats are 5'3" 145# 36dd.
My favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i'm trying it on in the house  i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.
I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality  but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it
This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.
This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.
I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine  but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck  it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup  and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and  for this reason  would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate  because the design is so pretty.
I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it's very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.
This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations. very unique and well-made. swing dresses can be a hit or miss  sometimes  but this one is perfect. couldn't be happier!
I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
Following the advice of other reviews  i ordered a size larger than normal  since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere  including the bust.  the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
I wanted this jumpsuit to work so badly. my regular size 2 crushed my "girls" flattening them and pushing them up over the top of the jumpsuit. unfortunately i had to go up 2 dress sizes to get it to fit around my bust but was then so big that the material in the front was gapping and folding over. for reference i am not overly busty  a 34 c with petite but muscular build.
Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .
Love the colors  love the design  and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or 2 so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
Perfect summer/fall top. can also layer it. i wear it over a tank tunic and love it.
I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist  however.
It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however
The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra  no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top  because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package  it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated  it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the
Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.
This is a great dress. i purchased the red and gold motif. i like that it is versatile and very comfortable. plus  it has pockets!!! love that! i am fuller in the bottom  so i was concerned with the pockets adding bulk. so far  so good.
I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but  for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.
If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.
I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.
This is a super cute tank- fits good  flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.
This tee fits true to size  not oversized. the material is super soft and the colors are delicate. the armholes don't show your bra which is hard to find. nothing bad to say about this top except that my size was sold out in every color but lavender (which was lovely!).
This pullover is perfect for spring all the way into fall. it is comfortable and the perfect piece to throw on over a summery tank and jeans. i've even worn it over dresses before and it worked great. soft fabric  but durable. i've had a lot of compliments on this pullover and recommend it for you!
I have these pants in the blue/grey color and like them so much i got them in olive. wash well  fit perfectly... easy to throw on and look great!!
The burgundy and black dress is stunning on. beautiful cut and colors. i think i do need the petite however. the material is not as stretchy as other dresses  but the dress does keep its shape.
Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.
Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.
I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit  because
I thought this dress was beautiful and the quality is amazing. i thought it was going to be black and gold  but it has a lot of brown in it as well. i ordered a petite. i'm 5'61/2" and the petite was just above my knees whereas the regular came below my knees. this is a dress i can wear to many events.
The details on this dress are lovely. the embroidery is wonderful. but the fit on this dress is just not for me. it is very baggy and shapeless. it doesn't have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless. really unflattering. sad but it's going back.
Beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light  yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large  but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is  it works.
Well made  versatile dress. have already worn it to a wedding and work - could definitely be dressed down for a more casual look. i'm 5 7 and typically wear a medium in dresses and the small was definitely the right fit with some room to spare.
This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights  etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you  buy it!
I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.
I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.
It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms  and because of the a-line  through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy  and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped  and i suspect it had been worn.  going back. not tracy reese's best piece.
Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top  with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom  which is not how it appears to be  but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down  as the armholes are not huge  and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2" to not bug me  and i'm typically a med  which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1" on each side  which is
Easy breezy summer dress!!! love the detailing under the arms!!!
I love the contemporary style of this piece  but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1"). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms  it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces.
Love love this sweater/shirt. i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings. it is soft and comfy. the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing. i even bought it in the pink.
What i liked:  1. midweight fabric. it's not lined and when i read polyester in the description  i was worried that it might be thin  but this is a stretchy midweight fabric.  2. pretty pretty print    what i did not like:  1. i don't know what dress the model is wearing  but this was an empire waist dress on me. i'm 5'7". because it was empire waist  the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me.  2. the sleeves are cut oddly. they look too wide for the dress  even on this model.  3
This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!
I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.    great buy
The previous review by beardedlady said it best: "yes  i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i don't care. this is a fun  creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment."       in my own opinion  i don't think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so i'm happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look. i am 38-27-35/36c/135# and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size 10 re
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.
This tunic has nice  soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out. it's comfortable and the fabric is very nice  but it is not flannel as advertised. the tunic is made out of a double-gauze cotton  which is a great fabric with a casual look.
This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.
I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra  could be a little more supportive. pretty color  with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.
I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage  the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!
I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite  it will be worth every penny.
Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am 5 ft 32 d 27 waist.
I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo
Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange  so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!
I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well  so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures  i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d
I wanted to love these pants  but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.
I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful  flowing  light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.  i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment  some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t
I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers  i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday  am wearing it today  and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye
I wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.
I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package  i could not believe how soft it was. literally  as a cloud. think of the softest  fluffiest baby blanket. also  the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7"  135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly  flowing  but not boxy. love it!
Loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i'm not a fan of. mine was mostly cut from the "mum/sunflower" patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern. the shirt online as a good combo of patterns-- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print! way overboard!! that said-- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail-- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic!
These jeans have become my new favorite pair! i bought two pairs during the clearance sale and wear them often. i love the metallic accents near the front pockets and the dark wash can be dressed up or down.
I'm usually a petite  but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better  but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2" and 105 lbs  but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry  it's a return for me.
I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.
This is such a beautiful top with pretty  vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine  the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back  with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!  so sad to have to return this one.
This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
Lovely jeans  love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans  the relaxed "boyfriend" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute.
Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
The colors are vibrant and the beading is beautifully simple and nicely done. i waited quite a few months for this dress but it was worth the wait! it's loose fitting  but still gives you some shape without looking like you are wearing a potato sack!
This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh
This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.
I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug
It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!
I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.
The model doesn't do this jumpsuit justice. absolutely gorgeous!  beautifully constructed   cute details   flows well   easy to dress up or down...  5'5" 135 34 c- the 6 was perfect.
I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10"  and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model  and the cut was just too wide under the armpits.
These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!
I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.
I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall  spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.
I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful  non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable  i love the fit  and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.
I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres
Good fit  quality  similar to the brand's other jeans.
I like the feel  stretch and softness of this dress  it's very comfortable. sadly  as others have commented  the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4  but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7" 120 lbs  34d and ordered a 6.
This sweater/tunic is lovely - soft  just enough structure in the top to not look like a sack  pretty color. i ordered the "raspberry" which is definitely more of a "burnt orange-red" to my eye. i understand what another reviewer was referring to regarding quality. the fabric just doesn't feel very substantial or strong. i have a feeling this might not last too long and it's a shame at this price point. i'd love to order another color but will definitely wait for sale. it's office appropriate an
These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.
But  saldly  no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good  though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue  though  is the fit. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist i typically wear a m in a knit top  but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my
I absolutely love each this dress! it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i don't agree that it mages it look cheap. love the neckline and the length is perfect unless you're a petite size. i would snatch this one right up if it weren't for the price point. i'm hoping it'll go to sale but it's so beautiful it might be sold out by then . the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily.
I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick  high quality material. i only wish they had more colors!   sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well  although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me  although i am small chested  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it to work.
Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small  and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords  27 in some jeans. . i'm 5'2"  currently 25" waist  33" high hip  37.25" at the widest  29" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass  flatter stomach  bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great  which is why i risked paying shipping on these. . the 27 was loose at my natural waist  the jeans measuring 29.5"
I really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame.
I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma
I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.
This one totally worked for me. love the color  length  and style.
I liked the concept of this vest  but when i tried it on  i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made  though  and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
I love a good peplum top  and was so excited when it arrived  but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering  because in every other way  it fit like a dream  but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.
I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of "blousing" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!
Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.
It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!
Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
I'm a 12/14 and i got a large and the dress fits nicely through the hips/seat. i'm kind of pear shaped so it's a bit large through the top  but i intend to layer another knit top under it so that's ok.    i didn't want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting. i like the colors and the fabric. the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off i'm careful with it. it will be nice into fall with a sweater.
I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c  broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots  you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long  even in the petite sizing. overall  i kept it as it was slimming  quality made  and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)
The fabric is a little stiff  the back looks unusually long compared to the front  and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it! (as a side note  it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy  otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.
This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color  not close to red  but it will work well with black  gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.
A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect.
This is the perfect day dress--loose fit  comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type  but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller.
I ordered this dress in a size 8  my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person.
I bought this top for my sister's birthday so the review is based on her opinion. she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful. she said it was tts. she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down.
A wonderfully heavy weight piece  opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer  this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck  which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!
I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn't as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn't a stretchier denim. but  my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good.
This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look  it just was terrible on me. i'm petite  5'0" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.
Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high  my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin  not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a
This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation  but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.
This sweater is super cute with the mock neck. i love all 3 colors. i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters  and purchased a s in this one. now that i've put it on again at home  i'm wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short. i'm 5'6" (and 126 lbs)  so not overly tall and don't typically have this issue. i feel like the model (who is likely taller than me) has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back
Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer  which is actually great for me  as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle  which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.
Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.
I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
Love this top! it's pretty  unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.
Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person. glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case. drapes nicely (exactly like in the picture) and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardigan/shrug. loose fit means i can wear it to work  too. am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well. also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and i'm 5ft4 so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon
This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable. the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground. but it is still super cute and a keeper !
Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.
Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all  but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium  sometimes a small  but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!
These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string  which ended up working out  but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites  but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts  as th
The dress is pretty  i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran  i took both back the neck is too tight!
I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!
This worked for me  very elegant  cozy and comfortable.
These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful  comfortable  and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.
I bought the white in a m  one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s  given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me  at 5'6"  so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.
Lightweight  airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker  higher quality silk. the waist has a tight  wide  elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and "faux" lay
The style  plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue  & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature
I got this online in a sale and couldn't wait to try it on at home! it's so cute  the fabric is a great print and the fit is swingy  which i love. i have a larger bust than waist and i'm 5'8"  160 lbs. i ordered my normal size 10 and it fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear it with booties this fall!
This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color  casual. fit me like all the retailer size  8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.
Tts and very feminine and flattering. looks same as on model. love this style. if you like style highly recommend . armholes not too big- yay!
The skirt is a little longer than i expected  it hits me at my calf  i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely  very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic
I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed.
I just received them (blue) and wore them today. i got so many compliments! they are comfy and very flattering. i would not call the fabric cheap at all. it is super soft and washes and wears nicely. i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly  even though i am on the large side of medium. i'm ordering the other color right now!
I like these jeans because they are long enough to wear with any kind of shoe or boot and they have enough stretch to be comfy  but not too tight and they do not bag out :)
I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt. it is a beautiful color! i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it. my husband said he loved the color and style. i wear either a s or m in retailer tops  depending on the brand. with this one i chose a small and it's fits perfectly. i have a petite frame; 5'2"  123 lbs.  but with a 32f bust. it is very flattering  as with most off the shoulder tops. they say your shoulders never age :) the length is just right
The material of the dress is gorgeous  but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition  i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow  exposing your "chicken wings" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model  so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot!
Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
This is a must have! way cuter in person. love the look and feel. it runs large so size down. it's more cream than white
This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it. will be returning it.
This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go
Easy to wear.  the fabric is super soft and the shape is very flattering.   i really like the shirt hem at the bottom.
I love this shirt! i got the one with the skiiers. for reference  i got a size 2 and i'm 5' 6"  135 pounds. it's a bit tight around my shoulders  but not enough to make me want a size 4. if you have broader shoulders  a 4 would probably be good. the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs. it's too short to really tuck in comfortably. the print is absolutely perfect. the shirt is soft and very flattering. it's pricey but super cute!!
Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute.
Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on  the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails  it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!
Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
Just didnt like the fit. it "puffed out" in front  so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape  and this was not a good fit for me.
As other reviews stated  this dress runs very large. it was a big potatoe sack on me. added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos  it is going back!
Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great! i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you can't see my belly. i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus.
The material was thin  showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
These tailored front flowy back tops don't always work. this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering
I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline  because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas  the adorable print  the handy bra-strap holders  and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3" and 120 lb  small up top  not especially curvy but not straight either  and i ordered my usual 2p. yup  the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way
Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.
This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas)  so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color  but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.
I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m
Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.
Love this dress! light and breezy  but i'm wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look.
I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short  and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.
I'm between sizes in deletta (m to l  5'4"  34g).  i ended up purchasing the large in both black and sapphire.  it does fit a bit tight in the arms and torso  but it's a nice basic top for work  and does well with changing seasons.
I love the pattern  but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work  but overall  i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see  and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person  this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print  and shimmer.
Retailer  please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable.
The fabric was a beautiful color  but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.
I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!
This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!
I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
I am normally a m-l (170 lbs  5'4"  34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big  and it is huge. seriously  i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing  but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey  i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty  and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size.
I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately  i couldn't make the fit work. for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers  i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms  and i don't have particularly large arms  so i ordered the sp  hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately  the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l
I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy  cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly  but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it's completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.
Love this top!! perfect date night top! you can dress it up with a cute pair of heels or wear it around doing errands in some flats.
I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed  and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water  the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad  luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned  these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online  i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5"6"  120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store.
The skirt is very pretty  but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference  i'm 5'7" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price  i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times  then decide.
I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8)  so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me  but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.
I wear this out  but it's also a super comfortable to lounge around the house in. i measure 35" 28" 40" (6 through the top  10 in the bottom). i ordered a medium based on comments from other users concerning the top and it being constricting. i didn't find that to be true  but for a closer fit i probably should have ordered the small. overall  this is a fun dress to wear.
This skirt looks great on  i didn't even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design  not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last.     then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose  flowy  swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses  but i do love a feminine  loose  casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size  fitted on the arms  loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place  which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off  immediately. i tried them on again a second time  still hopeful  with the same outcome. sadly  returning.
I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit  but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right  which would be okay. however  the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing.     it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
This was was a great buy! i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent. the material is thick and stretchy. there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps. the dress style and cut is very slimming. i am more a size 14 (at 5'10") and the 12 fit well. i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder. it doesn't lay on me either like it does on the model  but it doesn't detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives.
This is a great tee. true to size  i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.
Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea
This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.
Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did  it is lovely! i can't wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"  i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)
This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right  although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall.
Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately  there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin  this is a beauty.
I ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store  but unfortunately it did not work for me. the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful  and the colors are gorgeous. i do not think it runs big  i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing. if you are tall and thin with no bulges  this dress is for you.
This piece is very comfortable and feels well made. it is not slimming.
This is a cute waffle t-shirt material is very thin and see-through it's a cute shape and style but it runs absolutely huge    is not a shirt for petite people   the extra extra small was huge
I didn't think much of this online but it was very nice in person. i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming. fits tts.
When i saw this item online  i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it. the pros: very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo  the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had
I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake  i don't anticipate this will last that long  but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t
Love this dress! great for dressing up and down or just to throw on for the weekend. the fit is very flattering but i will say the fabric is very thin so you must use a slip  it's totally see through.
Wow  i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.
I just purchased these joggers on-line during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts. i'm 5"4" and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect. these aren't super thick or anything so i think they'll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in. i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too.
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length  it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color  it's just as pictured. like someone else said  you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!
Soft  comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt. i'm 5'10"  130...typically wear a 4. the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled. high hem hits me a few inches above the knee  low hem a few inches below.
I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size  but is very short. i am 5'2" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.
I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.
These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b
Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.
These are some of the few pants that are semi loose with a wide waist band that make me look thinner! i love them. they are soft! they match everything. they make an outfit effortlessly chic. i took a size m and it fit tts.
I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue.
It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough  there is a slip underneath.
I am a huge fan of cloth and stone tops as they are very versatile. this particular one didn't disappoint. the combination of plaid and tie dye is so fun and fresh  yet the blue makes this piece an easy one to match with many bottoms.  now for the fit: the cotton is very soft and lightweight. i bought my normal size medium and it fits perfectly.  i look forward to wearing this piece often.
So this shirt is adorable. soft  fun  lays nicely...  but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie's before you put it on.   i don't even have large arms  the medium fit me perfectly  but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams. this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection.     i mean  i'm not a large? but i guess if i want this shirt  i will need to take it back and get a large  otherwise  it will be sleev
After the reviews about sizing  i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly  the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said  the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big  it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide  crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the
It is the perfect top to wear in the summer  it is nice and you can be somewhat dressy or super casual. i don't like anything too tight around my stomach and this has a nice flow with just the right amount of material.
Loved the print on this dress  however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly  and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.
I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back  thin  silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .
The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.
Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into  the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable  stretchy but not clingy.
I like the design and the color of the cardigan (i got green). i like the details on the back. the cardigan is tts  the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect (for reference: 5'7"  125 lb  got size s).    the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately. it may work for a smaller lady  but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier.    also  it is not just that the material is
Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side  which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
I would say that this blouse runs 1-2 sizes too small. the fabric is unique - it's like gauze backed by fine netting - and the workmanship is excellent.
Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans. bought these in a moment of "treat yo' self" mentality. absolutely do not regret it. at 5'7"  27-28 waist  typically a 28 in denim - i got the 27s as i found that they not only fit in the waist  but were more slimming. black "denim" typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric - these have a great weight  perfect ratio of thickness:stretch  look incredibly sleek paired with anything. high rise keeps my belly in check  and a
I love this dress  and on sale it's a total steal. it's true to size  and beyond comfortable! i live in az so i can easily wear this year round. i got the black color and love it. i'm 5'4" and it hits a little above my knees. love the loose  feminine swing. i feel like skipping wearing this dress :)
This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!
I love this vest  bought it in green and want to order white. its very flattering  and i wore it with a black tank top  ripped faded stevie cropped jeans  and gold gladiators. i would like to mention the care. i dripped something on the lapel  so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel. it made a lighter mark  so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine. i hung it to dry  and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up. it lightened up a
Beautiful dress! flowers and material look even better in person. loose fit.
This dress is especially beautiful in person. the tulle doesn't snag and lays nice and flat  not point. this dress is easy to dress up or dress down  fits comfortably and has some stretch to it. the bodice does run a little high  higher than what is shown in the model picture  but lovely nonetheless.
I saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it. i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs (real ones) and i was not sure it would provide enough support. it is the cutest suit ever. have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldn't go for a jog. ha. it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit.
This top is a nice piece to transition into fall. it goes well with jeans  but it could also be dressed up with black pants.
This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
Lovely color and sweet top  but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.
This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket  but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.
I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.
I tried it on at store and went back to buy it once it hit the sale rack. not the kind of dress that grabbed my attention online  but once i put it on i knew that it would find a way to my closet. the fabric is high quality  and there is lots of it. the color  the weight  the pockets- i love everything about it. i see how it might not work for everyone  but for me (5'7  135 lb  36b) xs is a great fit.
There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
Prettier in person! so pretty! i'm 5' 6'' 120 lbs and the xxs fit well. i normally wear a 0-2.
The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter  but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular  as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway  i'm 5'5" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well  and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly  i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place.
Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
I had high hopes for this top based on the photos  but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it  almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.
Runs big  but the fabric is nice and comfortable. i had to return first order and order the next size up. it is short in the front but a nice length in the back. it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique  more brownish orange than red. it will look great with boots!
I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers  i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress  which is not easily noticable in the web photos  and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.
This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.     the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.     the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a "1920s circus diaper" look which is not good.     they're also really tight compar
This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!
This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.
I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers  and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker "winter fabric" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome  but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze  but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch  these
I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however  i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater  it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice  but it was large around the torso  yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
I bought this is in the gray color  although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said  and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it  giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.
I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes  00p and 0p  depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes  i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far  so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area  i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derrire. the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor
I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this  one size fits all could just about do it.
But i thought this was lace or with texture  it is more a pattern on regular fabric.    colors are nice  there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern  the fit is nice  the 0p fit snugly enough  i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)
Purchased the navy/green and the red/brown. ultimately exchanged the red for the black/gold. the charlies tend to run small  so size up one. i normally wear a 26/2  but needed a 4 in these. the side zip makes for a slimming fit. i'm 5'3 and it is an ankle fit. i've paired a sleeveless silk navy blouse with the blue pant when the weather was warm and now i pair with a white oxford and navy cable knit sweater. i see many more possibilities for both pairs. fun print and fabric that can work through
I love these shorts  very pretty and well made  but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs  beware  not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg  creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on "skinny" legs.
Beautifully designed to flatter a women's figure. i love the fit and feel of this classic  but modern cardigan.
I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me  it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in "person" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots  which is a nice subtle touch. i put "runs small" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy  it is nice and soft. i
I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print  almost a picnic vibe  and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though  i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6  and am busty  and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red  as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.
Ref: 5'4"  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.
I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me  and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts  but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace  however. it is so delicate. no issues  but just be careful!
I was looking for a basic tee  but this one was just ok...the quality is okay  but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately   i will be returning this item.
Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however  the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
First of all i need to state that i am 5 1". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel  it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan  there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c
This dress is so beautiful on. purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down. material is lightweight (perfect for summer) and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine. i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size.
Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5"  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.
I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the "grey" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.
I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on  but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first  they are definitely short when rolled twice  and i do not have skinny legs. in fact  i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason  these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer  but i still like them at home
I wanted to love this dress  and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me  however  the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close  so sad
I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli
I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite  but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
T.la has another winner in my book. i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee. it's a soft blue almost light periwinkle. fabric isn't so thin so it not see through. thank goodness. i actually love it so much i'm ordering the other color as well. i absolutely would recommend this cute tee. love love t.la.
I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.
This tank is lovely: understated but well-made of nice fabric. i love viscose because it drapes nicely on my curves. but this is a swing shaped tank. shoulda known better. and it's cropped so... giant fabric tent hanging from the biggest part of me. if i put in big french darts  it'd be too too short. no way to make it work so it's going back. (p.s. i clicked "true-to-size" but what does that mean?? sizes vary from brand to brand  from decade to decade... i don't understand how anyone could thin
Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings  i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said  "that's going to pill up." and i ignored her. and she was right.
Nice dress  but the leather seats of my car were ruined when the sharp metal beads on the back made deep scratches~ not fun at all. now i must carefully take them out  bad design feature.
The label says 100% linen  but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit  but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it.     i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape  but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much  i just bought another one in mauve.
I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however  the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly  but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price  i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous  so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .
Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.
I love the greenish option  beautiful color. the fabric super soft  and like the peek thru openings on the arms - they call it lace  but it's not really. i'm 5'9 and 140 lbs  medium was good. it is long  but it is what i wanted so works for me.
If you want it  buy it now. this dress is everything and then some. love it. i bought two  the neutral (black) and the turquoise. the turquoise one is a very retro print  i am getting many compliments. they are so comfortable and flattering. i'm all about this price point retailer. more please!
I usually wear xl in tops at retailer  but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft  but doesn't breathe all that well.
The material is so soft  and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit  and a polished-casual look.
I adore this top. lovely color  fit is very flattering. can dress up for work with a skirt  or down with jeans.
This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.
I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it  which can be true for a lot of "swing" dresses as some give off that "baby bump" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short  even for us at just over 5 feet tall.     when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels  it falls perfectly and
I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me  it's not a flattering cut.
I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice
I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab  yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons  yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands  yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits  so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits
Hangs terribly off the chest. tent-like. looks maternity. no thanks.
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.
I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best. for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am 4ft 10"!   the color is a beautiful dark blue( not sure why the color online says charcoal) and the opening at the chest area is a little low  but nothing that double sided tape can not fix.  another bonus  as other reviewers have stated   is that you can wear a regular bra. lastly it does not wrinkle  so you can bring this on vacation
Absolutely love the cut and design of these pants! fit so well and unique pattern at the ankle however  as is the case with many white pants  so disappointed when i tried them on at home and could see my underwear (nude color!) the pants are beautiful in every way except that they need to be lined! going back - may order the black since they're not likely to be "see through!" disappointing! was hoping to wear them to a dinner party!
I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment  like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips  typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before  and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li
I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year  but this kind of boxy  straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however  i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off  i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses  with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet)  and i love it.
I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!
This is as pretty in person as it is online  good quality (except one item i'll get to)  and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"  normally a medium/8  and the medium fit great in this top.  i almost kept this shirt...so close  i had it on a hanger  but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online  but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on  my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)...
I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy  and is a bit warm for indoors  but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10". usually a small  but sized up to a medium with this one.
When i saw these lounge pants  i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!
This is a unique blouse  it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit  but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.   the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.
I'm usually a 12  or size l in retailer and when i tried this on  buttoning it up from the bottom  i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined  which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy  and a good length - many trenches are too short  or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i
This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.  i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.  overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale  i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome.
For me this is the perfect blouse. alone or with a cardigan it's a winner. not too low cut  armholes are perfect. i would buy other colors if they were available.
Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person  which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a "mommy tummy" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall  happy with this top :)
This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"  125#  27/4  and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out
This is a beautiful dress  considering it is made from polyester. that being said  the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately  if you are on the taller side  it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11" and a size 10. the medium fit best  although because of the length  she is reluctantly returning it. sad  because it ha
This top makes me feel like the artist i am. it's so beautifully embroidered and detailed! i wear it with cords or jeans and it never gets boring. it was worth every penny!
Cutest dress i own. very flattering  makes your waist look tiny.
I ordered this in the tangerine and it is so cute. its very comfortable and flattering. i wore a tank under it  but didn't find it to be as sheer as other reviewers. i paired it with slim pants  brown suede ankle boots and a long necklace and it was one of the cutest outfits i have worn in a long time. i got a lot of compliments! i want this in tons of colors/patterns!
I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue)  but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).
Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26" (so it is at least 2" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!
These pants are beautiful. the color is a nice deep red. pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself. my only regret is listening to the other reviewer. these pants run true to size. i am normally a 0p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a 00 because of the review claiming they run small. the waist is accurate sizing. the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th
So this is a gorgeous dress  but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more "girly" than "sleek." i am short  so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me.
This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.
I tried the size 2  regular in store. they were a bit roomy and since i am 5'3"  i was glad that they were offered in petite. they did not carry petites in the store so they ordered a petite 0 for me. i tried them on when i received them and they fit like they had been tailor made for me. the rise was a bit short but not a deal breaker  however  they were very long and i hoped that i had shoes that were high enough. i often hem pants but figure when i buy petites there is no need. also  the hem
The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy  too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.
Beautiful colors
I saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style. i really didn't think it'd fit on me  even though the only size available was a size 12  because it looked like a sheath-type dress that's more body hugging  and usually such dresses just don't work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame. howeverl here's what i thought: _____________ pros: - beautiful blush pink. it looks exactly the same in person as online. - very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned. t
I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down  but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to  nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.
I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments)  while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful  i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it  it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7"  135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially  but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still
As always  these ag stevies are perfect. i was worried they would run small  but they are true to size on me. i'm about 5'2" and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me. just above the ankles.
Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.
I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big; however  the garment is tight around my chest area (even though i am not chesty) and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic. i don't feel like they are gaping holes  there is just more area there than i would be used to. i like the fabric this is made out of. it is not quite as soft as i had hoped  but it is comfortable. i would say it is a medium weight-a little more than i was expecting. the flare is
This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on  but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric  but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece.
I usually wear a 4 in maeve  and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7"  34c  size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well  though  if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist  the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue  but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo
The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.
I bought in white. great for a lightweight cover up. well made and cozy!
These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.
This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way  did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric  go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.
Love this big top...! will be great for hot summer days.
I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes  2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
I absolutely love this shirt! even though it has a large flowy design it looks wonderful. the print is so unique and will transition to autumn beautifully! i loved it so much i got both colors.
Fit was very tts.  it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person  it's a fairly medium weight sweater.  i'm 5'8 and curvy  and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model.  i still liked the look  mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt.
Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially
I loved this dress. i kept putting it on trying to figure out how to get my boobs to not fall out all over the place. this is not a dress for larger breasts. it is absolutely beautiful otherwise!
It's ok  fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide  hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3" 140# 39-28-35 an
I love this skirt - fits great  snug but comfortable and the length is perfect for wearing with ankle strap sandals. the material is soft and hangs nicely. my new favorite skirt. i am 5'8 and curvy - got the large  which was perfect for my fuller figure.
This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.
I had my eye on this skirt online but it sold it out in my size 2 so i ordered a 0 and crossed my fingers. before it arrived  i happened across a size 2 at my retailer store that someone had returned. it fit perfectly. i am 5'6" and my waist is 25/26. it is high waisted but i thought that added to the fit and made it stand out from the usual black skirt. it fit my waist and hips./butt fine. it is quality material and has a structured fit and great length. it is unique and classic. i can see this b
I typically do well with jumpsuits but this one did not work. i am smaller on top than the bottom but not by much. i got the xs and it was tight in the calves and short in the waist but the top fit perfectly. maybe a s would have fit better but i got it on sale and s was out of stock. it defiantly did not look like it does on the model. :) i am typically a size 2. the material is really nice. i was hoping for a jumpsuit that could be casual an covered since most jumpsuits tend to show more skin
Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2  130 lbs  34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately  i will be returning.
Ordered this top online  color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous  comfortable and flattering  so much so  i am ordering the navy too. great quality   fabulous with jeans .
When i tried them on  i didn't want to take them off! they are so soft  so stylish  they drape your body just the right way  they are stretchy  so even though i am wearing 30 in jeans  i took s regular! run hone and tried it on with moss cowled side-zip tunic  2 different booties and aquaflora reversible vest  all variations and combos looked really cool and great! i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top (warm-up pullover in charcoal)  looked like high couture! the color i
I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves  and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t  with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted  which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum  which i don't always like hanging out there. in all  it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!
I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.
I really  really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty  and the front was flattering  but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly  i sent it back.
Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.
I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress  sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern  you can wear this with anything  and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
This has a heftier fabric than seems to be in the picture online. i wish it were the same fabric as the fringed chambray dress. that  coupled with it being cut very generously  and the hip placement of the bulky pocket fabric  causes it to look quite thick and dumpy unless you pin your elbows in to show where your waist is.  i usually wear a 4-6  and bought the 2. i'm returning it for a 0 petite and see how that goes.  i love it  so i'm hoping that causes the fit to appear more as it does on the
This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.
I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute  comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm  are incredibly soft  and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!
Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!  but as others have stated  the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.
It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight! i couldn't let go after i tried it on..it is soft  lightweight  moves with me  keeps me warm (not just from top up)..it feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylish..    runs true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it ...
This top is super soft cotton  with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top  which is a medium  faded olive color. despite the picture  this top is shortish in the front and on the sides  which are slit. the top is also very  very boxy. it's wide across  and doesn't "fit" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit  which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said  this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear
Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams  but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect  however  the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.  dress looks exactly as in the picture.
This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown. unfortunately  when i tried it on  it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to. i also didn't care much for the waist ties on the side. an elastic waist might have been better.
I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly. i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings. the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels.
This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but
Dress looks beautiful  but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly  but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4  the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p  i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like  it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also  this dress is very stiff  can't d
I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.    the birds of paradise are just lovely  not exactly the same on every suit  but still nice. i just
I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately  the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots  which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time  and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.  in terms of sizing  this fits tts  i normally wear a l or xl  got this in an
I needed to get this hemmed about 3-4 inches  but it was well worth it. this is a gorgeous  effortlessly glam outfit. the material is silky soft  with some stretch  and drapes beautifully. i am a 12/14 and got an xl-- i think a large would have been better (this had extra width at the waist  but it worked with the tie belt). i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night.
I love this tee but it isn't for everyone. i am usually a solid medium & i tried on both xs/s. i went w the small bc i liked the volume.  for reference  i'm 5'6" and wear a medium/size 8-10.     not thinking this is for small petite women as the peplum hem is poplin  not tee knit material so it holds its shape. on my frame it was so cute. got the holly color.
The pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.
You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish  yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything  the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall  it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!
And the bottom looks like a tutu. first  i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second  the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally  the color on the "green one" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.
The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely  and in general  it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price  very disappointed.
Hi  i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.
Ok  so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight)  am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso  short legs  and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise  this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu
I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray  not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.
I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email  i new i had to check it out. the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasn't a deal breaker for me. because of the boxy shape  i went with a s. i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish. i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fall/winter. in fact  i am wearing it right now!
Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it "gaps" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom
I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso  the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.
I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric is lovely  soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great  that is  until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine  i have a large bust  and the fabric stretched across the bust  causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.
I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be)  but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!
The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.
This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room  or i would not have seen it. i tried it on  and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big  and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago  when just about everything in the store was truly unique.
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!
Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?)  thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do  you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me  i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup  and don?t even think
This dress really was huge  and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft  but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is.
This item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up  and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.
Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.
Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.
This dress is lovely. i tried it in the red and the black. decided to keep the red  as i have so much black. going to wear to a spring wedding - i will feel so comfortable and appropriate! just looking for a great statement necklace!
After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors  i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin  so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!
I have the blue version. i love the bold  pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.
Don't listen to other reviews- this runs large not small.  i have a 34d and i usually wear a 4 in most retailer dresses.  therefor after reading the reviews  i ordered a 6.  i was swimming in it.  just ordered a 2p and 2 to see which will fit.  the design is stunning and it's very well made.  i'm hoping for the perfect fit once the dresses arrive.
I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.
I think i ordered this in an xxs because of the other reviews making it sound like it ran large. and i'm happy with the size and overall look of this tee on me. i'm 5'3" about 105 lbs and 34aa (i generally order xs or xspetite). the cuffs of the sleeves are pretty tight and the v-neck is higher than i'd like but otherwise i really like the loose  casual fit. there's no armhole seam  they're dolman sleeves. the tee i got translates to "the beautiful coast". it does say made in usa on the label. a
This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately  it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2" 34c  28  37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr
I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person  but that's about it for me. thoughts below:  _____________  pros:  - tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c  5'9" frame and found it sufficient.  - the color is much nicer in person  as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think "mocha latte" in terms of color.  - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it
I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going
Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"  135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is  i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2" longer would also be a slightly better length.
Very graceful  long skirt. runs true to size and looks great! this is the kind of dress you will wear all summer long.
This is a great little top. colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life. ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model. you could probably size down. armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it. the body flows but it's not huge and is slimming. the high neck and tie are darling. will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools. good buy on sale.
Love this top. so soft and it fits true to size. i am a 36b and always wear a large. i am a size 12 in most tops and dresses. this top is flowy and comfortable.love the purple color. wish there was a large in blue left so i could order that too. love it!
Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend
A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places  no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size  you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.
I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews  but i couldn't get to a store during the mother's day event and really wanted this little number. it arrived yesterday and i'm already so excited to wear it  especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan. i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on top--the pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online. the fabric is also a good weight  and it is lined  which greatly simplifie
This is a great dress! it's comfortable  easy care  and it looks fantastic. i love the bright green color  it's easy to wear alone  casually  or dressed up with cardigans or jackets. for my climate  this is a year-round piece. i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons  and wear it alone in warm seasons.
Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.
I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also  it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.
My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.
I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms  very soft. high quality.
This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft  nice shape  unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops  but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up  it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned  but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
It's a cute top  but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily  but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b
This is a fun and classic dress. the dress is well made  as others said  it doesn't have much "give".  i am a 36c  29"  39"- and the size 8 fit perfectly. i didn't experience any gapping between the buttons. it is a nice fun summer time dress! it is also very flattering!
I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of "genie" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle  but the worst is the fabric. its "old lady" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim  and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping.
I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!  it is an absolute must-have!
Love this shirt! it runs a bit big  i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up  and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.
I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.
This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely  i don't have petite to compare  or 00  but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)    115 lbs for reference...
This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!
I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5"  130 pounds  usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model  but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.
I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design  i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it  i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#  36dd  i hold my weight in my neck  shoulders  back  upper arms  tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)
This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress  wish i had sized down
Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small.
Looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar. colors are nove and the feel is soft. i would probably have to get a petite smaller size.
This blouse if very pretty and feminine. i agree with the other reviews that said it emphasizes the size of your hips. i don't have any so it was great for me!
Never thought i would buy a jumpsuit  but this one is gorgeous. i put true to size. i ordered a m and a l. i kept the l because i like the looser fit. weigh 150# and am 5' 6 1/2" tall. i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better. i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes. love the feel of it and the way it looks on me. really looking forward to wearing it. on sale it is a great buy.
I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go  a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least
These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed  pooling even with my highest heels.
Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!
Beautiful color  design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
Love this top! runs true to size. exactly as pictured.
The skirt looked orange online  but is more of a nice red (i do like orange too though). i had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see  but my store had it. glad because i would have ordered petite  adn i do think that would have been too short for me (not appropirate for work or (in my opinion0  my age). the skirt (size 0 regular)  fit my waste  and fell about one inch above my knee. i am 5'1.5" (115 lbs if it helps#... so petite would have been short.  the only thing tha
Beautiful top  loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from  hanging at store or the way it was sewn.
These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.
I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!
I absolutely love this top and it looks absolutely fabulous (the first time you wear it). the details are impeccable and you'll get compliments all day long. i paired it with a jean jacket and my favorite "destroyed" skinnies for an outing in tx wine country. there are a couple of key things to note. when you pull this top on... mind your make-ups. you can and will get make-up on the collar... and so  apply this shirt on carefully... or your make-up (vice-versa). now  after the fist wear  which
I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft  stretchy  shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves. not for me but maybe for others. just ok.
This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!
Im a busty gal at a 34ddd and this was pretty flattering. it showed off my curves and hid my unfit belly with ease. i usually am a small to medium and i ordered large in both the grey and gold stripe and i love them both. they fit flawlessly. very flattering and i like the high neck line
These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely "relaxed" and look a little baggier on than in the photo  but still cute and flattering.
This top is gorgeous  but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5" at the bottom  right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area  the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest  and is styled that way  so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up  but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise  and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i
The fabric   feel and design of this dress is sooo cute  but so large that sadly  it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.
This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops  but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c  and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer  but not so much you need a cami.
These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look  they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!
This sweater is so cute and classic and i've gotten so many compliments it's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend
I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well  and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down  but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.
I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending  but it was kind of a serious no go. first off  i ordered a petite size  but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5'  so not even technically petite  but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length  and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline  sleeves  pattern  fabric  and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde
This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great  i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall  it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.
The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small  but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.
Loved the idea of this - unfortunately  it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5"7" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend.
This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty  and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping  too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the
I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer  and this is not it. like others  it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps  but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.    - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however 
Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back  and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight  nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be "drapey". i kept it.
I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot  but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me  however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality  thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
This shirt is really lovely. the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done. it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look.
Love it fits great very comfy goes with all
I got the yellow ones and love them so much i ordered the stone color. very comfortable and i can wear in th office or on the weekend. thinking about ordering every color! i love the pilcro hyphen line. fits my 5'4" frame and athletic build perfectly! i'm 135 lbs and wear a size 28.
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.
I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.
What a great shirt. however  none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture. the front of them are all a deep blue color  no tie-dyed effect or whatever you're seeing on the online pics. the shirt runs large. i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big. i can't imagine how the larger size would have looked! i think this top will go with many things  including as a cover up over dresses.
I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist  in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity  even in a petite xs  so it's going back.
This is such beautiful material  but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress  and now it's going back.
I was really looking forward to these tees working  after reading the reviews. unfortunately  they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.
These are very well-made jeans  the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist  and they make my butt look great. however  these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing  but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy  then buy your regular size.
I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out  but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.
I ordered this top in my normal size medium  and it was very large. i am 160 lbs  36b  size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty  that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight  but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck  but i am small on top  so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!
I just received these jeans. love them. i usually wear a 29- i ordered a 30 and they fit great. they are too long- will need to be hemmed. but the fit is great. the material is soft. lovely. great buy.
I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff  silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.
I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.
I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.
It's an adorable take on the "casual" sweatshirt. i love the layers  but i wish they were just a little different. they hang a little strange. perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer? i'm not sure. or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer. it all hangs just a little...off? but  it's not so off that it looks bad. i'm petite  so it's cute on  but  i think if you were tall  it might hang a little weird. a warning though  i ordered a small  and the
I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
Sheer and lightweight. perfect for summer. great detail could not justify paying full price.
I so wanted to love this dress  despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.
I purchase this top of "what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope
These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans  without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference  i am 5'2"  108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle.
This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look
The design of this top is super cute and the material is decent. the only flaw is that despite buying the smallest size (xxsp)  it's still very boxy on me. i wish it was more fitted at the waist which would make it much more flattering. however  since i am actually pregnant  this actually works to my advantage  for the time being.
Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.
I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles)  the length is perfect  the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all  unlike another reviewer) the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look  which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide  swingy style  but with the sl
I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered  but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good  but the back just looked like a big oversized  stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall  go for it!!
I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy  so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well  hang dry  easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!
I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue  which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss.
I really wanted to like this shirt  but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.
I really wanted this to work. alas  it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up  and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up  but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.
I wear this top with jeans or cords. i allways get compliments. it's comfortable and versatile. go down a size!
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.
I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt  which emphasized my shape. unfortunately  it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.
I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt  but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat  which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious
This is my new favorite sweater and i want it in all sizes. i have the ivory and now the taupe-totally would have bought the green had it been in stock. the red is a more rust color  but it is still gorgeous. although the knit looks and is looser  it is still very warm. i wore it today and was a little too hot for this mild day. it is longer so it can be worn nicely with leggings and still look great  but it has a good fit and shape so as not to look frumpy. love. tts  but could also size down i
Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown  or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!
I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
By itself  this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however  with a belt  it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt  the skirt falls perfectly   it's perfect  especially with it's rich colors.  for $50  you can't go wrong and i'm positive you need this dress. boots  heels  jacket  whatever  it goes up and down  it's perfect!
The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok  but i felt more comfortable in the 6  and it had a really nice fit.    the quality is good  but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges  so i'm not sure how it will wear.
This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery  yet subtle  and it's a nice sturdy cotton  not flimsy and cheap looking. however  i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts  but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin  this might be great for you.
The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh  & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29  as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please  or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale  i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"  117#  slender legs  skinnys are either
I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party  i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved  so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.
The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch  the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.
I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress. it runs true to size  though maybe just a little bit large. i enjoyed wearing it from the get-go!
I love this top! looks great with just about any kind of jean (skinny  flare  especially high waisted). even looks good with vests and cardigans. a perfect versatile piece for the fall - you won't regret!
Great soft tee. got the blue and really love the color.
Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.
Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.
Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly  it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything  yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's)  but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i
This sweater is so beautiful  soft  and warm. the neck is a little different and meant to be worn off the shoulder. i don't wear it off the shoulder. if you just work with it a bit it will lay nicely. i get compliments every time i wear it!!
Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite  but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4".
I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend
I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.
I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said  it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference  i actually love the fit and thought it was tts  though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a
I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos  size 0 in most pants   25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.
The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.    i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.    i do wish they came in more colors.
Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.
This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose  and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4  32dd  waist 27 and 130 lbs.
The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
I am just over 5'8"and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso  almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition  they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame  they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.
I was initially attracted to the colors
I did like this top  but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great  the fabric is amazing  but it just didn't fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size  but i just wasn't sure that i would wear it a lot.
These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me  these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small  they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas
This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2"  102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!
This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.  all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large  so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly  looks adorable on  and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!
I love this shirt and have received compliments each time that i've worn it. there is a lot of visual interest from the vibrant colors  stitching and mesh panel on the back  and it is a great transitional piece from late summer to fall and into winter. my only complaint is that the threads pull easily  and there are no laundering instructions  so i had to log in to the website to learn that it was machine washable. i would definitely recommend using a lingerie bag  washing on delicate and not pu
I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits  but for the sale price  i can overlook this.
I've been looking for a wrap cardigan for a while and this totally fit the bill. it fits well  is soft  and made of good materials. i love the versatility of using it with all my dresses. this is a great staple piece.
I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick  it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews  i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch  and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic  i was not surprised by the "brightness" of it like othe
This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus  the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great  comfortable fit  but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.
Great dress! needs a tank top underneath  but has a great shop.
I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
Loved the flared style of this cardigan. i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy. the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft. have used it many times already - always makes me feel great.
Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.
I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large  and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.
I love this dress  but have found that this brand runs large. i'd order a size down.
I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12  hourglass)  these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds  just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception. the fabric is heavy but soft  the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations. they are comfortable and flattering. i am 5'2" and these are not crops on me  with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me.
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.
Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors  it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.
The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased  but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute  but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.
Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works. much better and more vibrant in person. true to size. fits more like a maxi on me since i'm 5'1"
I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!
Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot
The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size  as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price  but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute  casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the
I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2  then tried them on a few times  and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right  the larger one  hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.
This is a simple  light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall  i'm happy to see a basic executed well.
I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough  but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two.
Love the top  but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
One of the most beautiful sweaters i've ever seen. i love it!
The fabric  so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern  so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple  yellow  orange  green  they're all in there. but here's the but....    i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me  i look like i'm wearing a sack  or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest  too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves  while adding
I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package  as the color was darker than on the picture.  i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design  it isn't for me as the color is too "winter".
I ordered this online. it's fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.
Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :)
I love this dress. so cute and easy to wear. with sandals  flip flops or tennis shoes. the material is a bit thicker than what i prefer for warmer weather  but very comfortable. this is my new favorite weekend/errand/summer out and about dress. can't wait to take it on vacation!
Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!
I carry my weight on my lower half  usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.
They were way way too small! i bought a 32 and they would probably fit someone that usually wears a 28. i was so sad to send them back because i loved them.
Love tiny. i am 5'7"  125-128 lbs depending on the day  and a 34a. i also have a very long torso  and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one  however  was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated  so it looked boxy on me. however  the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo  and then
This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.
This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref
I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did  i was very excited  in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately  neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows  making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
I love the colors  the material  the design details (especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves). the sweater is super soft and cosy. i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted. i am on tops between s and m. i am of tall   narrow build and athletic  which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest  arms and shoulders. to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s ;). anyhow  i was a bit surprised. in s the sweater fits very snug i
Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.
Fun top for day or evening.
Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short  just perfect.
I got this shirt in an xxsp  and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering  although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much  but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right  so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty
I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.
This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
This dress is truly a work of art  and i've received many compliments on it.     be warned  though  that it may require extensive tailoring to fit you. i'm 37-28-40 (so pretty darn hourglass shaped) and 5 feet 3 inches. i ordered the 8p. the dress was still huge in the the waist and not flattering at all. the neckline  also  was too low for my comfort. (if you're busty  necklines get pushed out and more things show.) my tailor was able to bring the neckline up by adding seams in the sleeves and
I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.
I love this sweater's rich color and good quality  but the fabric is very thick and heavy  the neck opening is too wide  and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.
I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt  with long boots  booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!
This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large  i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!
Surprisingly  this poncho is both flattering and soft. i must say i didn't think the fabric would be as soft  since a lot of knits have wool  but this is great.  i purchased both xs/s and xs/s p.  the petite was just slightly more fitted  so i went with that. i love the boat neck  on me  it gives the poncho an elegant look. colors are nice and neutral.i  think i will wear this with dresses and jeans  both. great purchase. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)
I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c
This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.
I had high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.
This is a cute dress  but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup  anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.
I love this dress  but it is inches shorter than the description says or shows. i am only 5'7 and it is 2 to 3 inches above my knee. otherwise  it is a loose fit and hides all problem areas.
Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.
Beautiful. got several compliments when wearing it. does not hold up with washes though. threads unraveling everywhere. i am thinking of returning it for this reason. fits true to size. i am 5'4" 118 lbs  xs fit. i am smaller on top.
I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
Like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose  billowy  and perhaps
Love everything about this dress except - it runs huge.  i am busty and usually wear a 12 in dresses  but the large was completely shapeless on me.  will try medium and hope it is better bc otherwise i love the dress!!
I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress  but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large  but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue  which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton  but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme
Works great on my 5'11" frame.  is pretty and feminine.  great with skinny jeans and booties!
Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat  but oh well  they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9"
The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so
I am usually an xs but ordered an xxs in this because it looked like it ran large. glad i did. it's still roomy but doesn't look too big. could be a swim cover-up or would look cute with jeans. very pleased.
I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!
I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale)  but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous  showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c)  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me  even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall  but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern  fabric  pockets  true to
I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue)  the fabric is comfortable  definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.
I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture   but still very cute.
I kept this top  only because i needed a plain black tank  but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.
I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same  boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it  and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top  but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium.
I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made  then it would have been a winner!
The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates "green multi"--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.
I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own  but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests  etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality  but it is holding up well so far.
I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual  white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!
This top is beautiful  however it runs beyond big!  i ordered my usual size and i could have fit 2 of me in this top.  i am reordering and going 2 sizes down!  the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.
Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs  which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully  too. i highly recommend this blouse.
Cute top  perfect by itself or for layering. i sensed it would run large  so i ordered an xxs  115 lbs  5'2".
I am 5'6"  130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.
I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium  which was just ok. overall  the top half was comfortable and fit nicely  but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo  a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c
I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes  big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!
I love this dress  it's very comfortable  slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light  i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall  i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.
I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.
These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
I ordered the red color. it is really good quality. the brownish accents with the burgundy is beautiful and different. unfortunately  i found it to run very large. my normal size fit like a tent  and i had to return.
I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight  but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently  nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric  i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded  and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"  weigh 134 lbs  and do typically wear size medium.
Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online  however  it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress  highlighting your figure.  i wish this could have worked  however  it felt a little too unshapely.
So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.
Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.
I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!
Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l  5'8" 175lbs  am busty. very nice fabric  prone to wrinkles.
Love the fit of this dress! i'm 5'2" 120 and the petite extra small fits perfectly. the waist is slimming and the cut is not too low. also great pattern.
I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button  which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly  as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled  slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!
I fell in love with this dress online  but it just doesn't look as nice in person. first of all  it's huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this  and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however  after seeing it in person  i didn't love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit.
I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it's soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin  so i found this a bit itchy right away  but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized  but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh.
I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right  not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits
The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.
This top is just lovely. the bow on the back is so unusual. i am so glad i bought it!!! i washed it on gentle and it turned out great!!!
Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.
I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.
I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.
This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans  classic denim  this fall  maybe with a jacket over.   i purchased a size medium  and it is loose and comfortable.
Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall  120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish
The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came  it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back.
This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!
This dress is lovely. the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model; otherwise  looks very similar to photo. it has a slimline style and is very flattering. the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo. its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress  notwithstanding another reviewer's opinion to the contrary.  i ordered up a size due to reading other reviews. i found it to be a bit larger than i wanted so i washed and tumble dried it on low
I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also  there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...
I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
It was the color that prompted me to take this dress to the fitting room. as seen in the photos  it is a deep burgundy or dark maroon. though the color is deep and rich  the design of the dress makes it lighter and easily able to be worn during the heat of the summer.     in the later months of summer and early fall  i will wear this dress without leggings for a transitional look. when the temps cool down  though  i will wear leggings or tights throughout the winter with the dress. it will easil
I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however  my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however  it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however  a supervisor was able to l
These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch  bind  or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.
Beautiful thick sturdy denim. probably the best denim i own in terms of the material. the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat. however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price  totally worth it.
Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture  definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
I like the feel and color of this blouse. however  i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse  it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the "curve" is not even visible when i wear it.
Cute  light summer dress. wish it worked for me. the tank part of the dress is light and super comfy. the bottom part of the dress is narrow and a bit fitted  doesn't work for a curvy bottomed girl.
I was so excited for this romper  but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price  and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
I purchased this amazing tunic in-store in the plaid pattern  and couldn't be more thrilled with it. i can already see myself overwearing it  because it's so pretty and easy. i typically wear an xs  and sometimes petite styles. the regular small fits very well. i'm sure the xs would have been alright  but i like the way my forearms don't feel constricted where it buttons  and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes. i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes. it
This is so comfortable  i had to buy another one. looks great under sleeveless sweaters. interesting texture adds interest.
I think these are amazing for anyone over  say  5'5". the way these hung on me (at 5'2") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.
This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me  as i have a long torso  but i wish it had fit right!
The dress is beautiful in pictures  but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly  had to return.
Overall: soft material  cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right.     fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a  than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad
This shirt is so cute. it's so soft  love the lace element on the arm. definitely thinking of ordering the white. the back for me is a lot longer then the pic shows but i think it looks good.
Love this chinos.  they fit tts and the blue is vibrant.  bought them in pink too.  for reference i am 5&amp;amp;amp;#39;5&amp;amp;amp;quot; and weigh 122 lbs and bought size 27.  the fit is a bit slouchy much like in the photos.
This dress is seriously gorgeous  and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy   pear shaped  and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric  fit and style of this dress.
As other reviewers have pointed out  this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight  and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve  but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.
The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.
I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it's not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.
Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
I tried this on at the store  and though it was pretty  i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea  but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and "idea" of dress (looks stunning on model)  but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly  has to be returned.
I knew i would love this dress  it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves  these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but  the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4  or s/m this was a small. will return. if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.
This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however  i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.
This dress is a bit scratchy  but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair  the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene.     the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders  small chest and and slim.
I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.
I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting  this one would be great.
Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.
I got this top in the beige  size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it  they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.
I am currently searching for the perfect pair of white boots to go with this. this is so fun. i used to wear a lot of vintage clothes and this dress lit the fire again to start looking for cool pieces. i tried on my usual size and found that it fit pretty tts. it was a bit roomy in the hips  but considering the cut of the dress  i assume that to be intentional. for reference  i am 5'9"  150 lbs  36d and bought a size 8.
I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!
I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site  but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.
This shell can be worn casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. enjoy!
It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all! it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature.
I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!
Great color but frumpy fit. if you have any bust  it looks a bit like maternity
Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable  yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique  yet whimsical swimsuit style.
I was excited to get these pants & at a great price! i am 5'9 & these pants were plenty long enough for me. they also have a nice light textured design that's hard to notice in pictures. the only problem was they are a side zip pant which i didn't know when ordering. i don't love the zip on the side for my shape it. so i'm still wondering if i'll keep them. other than that nice pant!
It's a t-shirt. a very cute print  nice cut  very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore  why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it  but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.    for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer  and the medium fit well.
This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust  but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust  although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
The regular length i tried on in store definitely didn't work for me. for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40.
I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all  it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one.     the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"  120lbs  tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs  and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy  and it drapes well. because i am petite  the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately  the petite xs is sold out  so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti
Love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint. the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable.
Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft  and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.
I tried these on at the store and thought the color  texture and style was very nice  but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle  so i suppose it is still do-able  but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.
I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event  i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit
This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material  but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately  i must return it.
These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.
I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket  and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color  it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying  it goes with everything and flatters all body types.
I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set  but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly  i returned the set.
I ordered this dress online and i love it! i'm only 5'2" so it's always a challenge for me with maxis but this one fit the bill. not too much fabric to be overwhelming on a shorter frame and the length was perfect. the fabric is very comfortable and moves with you. also the quality is great! i ordered a small petite but i probably could have gone xs petite. this would dress would be flattering on most people. need same dress  more colors!
This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination. and when i tried it on  i was sold. it's super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage.
Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering  really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.
This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.
I saw this on the rack  and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece. i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase  but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price. runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size 4 fit perfectly.
As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
This sweater is soft and comfortable. it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and in winter can be easily layered. at 4'11 it's a little large and could have sized down to an extra small petite  but still love it.
I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.
I love these jeans. the fabric is super  super soft with good stretch and give  however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference  i am 5'4" and wear size 25. comfy  go-to's.
These are comfy and cool. i got the blue  which is more royal than navy. in opinion  it goes well with almost anything! i can wear all the neutral colors  in addition to orange  red  yellow and patterns. they are flattering and like other reviewers  i went up a size to 28 in the blue. perfect length  not too short. got the same version last year in white  27. 5'4"  128lbs
This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat
I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.
The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress  twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print  i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s  with tights and boots  but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders  so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not
Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.
Ok  received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning  i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2  but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area
My main complaint  is that the button holes are too tight for such delicate buttons. one button shattered when i tried to get it undone  and what's even more crazy  is that mine did not come with any extras. so i guess i'll have to go to the fabric store to find a match. (i'll be sure to get a bunch just in case) a couple of minor notes; it smells like chemicals  and i won't be able to wear a bra  because the chest is a tad tight. however  the dress is cute enough  that i'll deem it worthy to we
The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.
The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was "ok". just didn't love it.
This shirt was a cute print  but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
I purchased all three colors! this sweater is gorgeous. i love it. it's made well  all three colors are beautiful and it fits great. it's definitely true to size. i'm thrilled with this sweater. adorable!
Love the print  length  and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de
This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
This is a great pant to wear to business and when you just need something more than a jean. not so skinny a 50+ woman can wear comfortably..
The fit is definitely more "straight-leg " and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!
I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse  but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day  i decided i needed another pair.  feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!
I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky  loose fitting  professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.
Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand  but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in "yellow" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better  but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute  but the qua
I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.
The dress looks even better in person. the fabric is very delicate though but worth the extra care it needs. the fit was perfect and the color is just as in the picture.
I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.
More importatn  super soft matieral and comfortbale  hwoever  when i put it on  ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric  but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.    true to size  tried on xs  maybe petite would work too.
This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.
I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily  hugs all the right places and skims the others  feels like pajamas  and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120  5'-1'  32 dd  usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small  and could have gone with either  but the petite had better proportions  especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi
I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite. it has a very clean design  well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch. i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come.
I love everything about this dress. the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional. the fit is true to size. i ordered medium. the length is as it appears on the model- just below the knee. the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit.
I was very impressed with the fit of this sweater dress. i am a 4p  5'4" and the length and general fit of this is perfect. the fabric is so soft. love it!!
I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass  ladies.
These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall  but run large. depending on cut/style  i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these  and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero  but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!
The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.
This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like  but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale  however! then they're all mine!)  this dress is soft  comfortable  classy  and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape  however  because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o
This top is beautiful and unique  but also i predict it will be high maintenance with the sleeves -- definitely have to be careful with the delicate sleeves.
This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.
I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it  but just not flattering. i am 5'2" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm "curvy" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat  just not for me.
This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
I love these jeans! they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price. they are a boyfriend fit  but you can order your normal size. usually with boyfriends  i have to order one to two sizes down. with skinnies and more fitted jeans  i am a 29 and that's what i got. there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while. the wash is absolutely beautiful...very worn. hopefully the holes in the knees won't get even bigger. i have worn and washed them now q
I ordered two sizes up  after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition. it is long...i am six feet tall and it is perfect for me. this is absolutely beautiful; my husband loves the floral print  and i received countless compliments after one wear. the light  flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended. very feminine and enjoyable to wear. pricey  but i felt i could wear spring through autumn. love! <3
That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.
Fits well (true to size)  very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!
This top is an amazing go to piece  and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say  that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore  it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.
Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one  however.
This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.
This bunches up too much  and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it  it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top  i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.
I liked the idea of the scarf tie  so i tried on this top in the store. it was so cute on  that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality. the material is more of a t-shirt with elastic at the bottom  so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat. i'm not sure how durable the fabric is. it's still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color. i think ti would look great with jeans but  with the right pants  i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work. it
As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.
This is a beautiful and warm sweater  well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing  especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.
I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow  not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy  though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to
This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit  but not as a layering piece.
This dress is lovely. timeless style  heavy fabric  only con? a deep front v. i couldn't wear this to church. i'm a 36d.
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.
Very pleased with my purchase! the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance. very soft and comfortable; definitely recommend!
I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.
The positive: light-weight fabric  interesting drape  the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.
I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
I purchased this dress in my regular size small as soon as i saw it pop up on-line and found it to be tts (34d-27-35)  it hits just to my knee (i'm 5'4") and it actually reminds me of the way maeve's devery dress looks and fits which is really  really nice. i'm finding this dress by floreat to also be quite slimming and the embroidery and colors set against the black is just absolutely gorgeous! the material is super soft  the v-neck isn't too low and i love the pockets so i'm very happy with my
I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material  but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.
I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.
I love this sweater! it is so comfortable and lightweight. i am always warm and i can see myself wearing this sweater without getting overheated. very flattering as well :-)
I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however  when i put the dress on  there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top.
I agree with other reviewers  this print is beautiful  i'd love to see the artists other work...  however  the price is steep for sure!  i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me  but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho  i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho  so if you're on the verge of siz
Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy  shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
This  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out .
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
Adorable  comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large  especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.
This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me  since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely.
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.
Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.
On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it  but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"  140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it  the clerks loved it  and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.
I love the look of this dress on the hanger in the store and in the pics on the model. but i purchased my usual size 0 in petite ( i am 5 ft 2 in.). it was very form fitting-too much for me- and had little gaps near the waist that i attributed to it being tight the hips. i exchanged it for a 2 petite and that was too large and gaped in the top and waist. for reference my measurements are 32-26-35. so i am going to deduce from my experience and the other reviews that this dress might be best sizi
Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa
I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.
This runs small  i got the size 3 which fits like a medium  not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit  it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.
Love this top! the material is very comfortable and it's loose fitting which is what i was looking for!
This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot)  so i would have liked to size down; however  the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms  maybe you could size down and make this work.
It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.
I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail  however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.
This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with  it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.
This is the softest  most perfectly cut basic. love the black  wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics  i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.
For fuller busted folks  this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful.
These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!
All the colors are beautiful  the white is a true white. i got the gray one. it runs large  so i would recommend sizing down  unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath.
I purchased this shirt in two colors. it was a bit longer than i was expecting. i'm curvy  5' 2" 180 lbs 36dd and the large fit perfectly.
This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me
I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall. the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear. the material is a good quality. this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet.
The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust  i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.
I love this sweater  i bought the grey and the neutral one. it is very soft  has great color combos and seems to have minimal pulling. even though it's lightweight  it keeps me warm.
First of all  the colors are really pretty  fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested  this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid  it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.
It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however  the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store  unfortunately.
I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl   wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full   a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however  like others have commented  it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
I love this  just bought it and so glad i did. really want to wear it out  so hopefully the weather will cool down soon since i am in the south and we are experiencing an extremely warm winter. regardless  it will be with me a long time...so if i don't use it this season  i will eventually as it is timeless and goes with anything.
This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy  but the dress doesn't feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous  but still subtle. it's a little too nice for me to wear to work  but the perfect special occasion or party dress
Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2" about 110 pounds and not flat chested.
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it didn't really feel "brand new" when it arrived
I have several lilka pj bottoms and i'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts  soft flannel  striking colors  only wish they had pockets!
This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
These shorts work well for shopping  running errands  or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.
I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
Great cardigan. love the tie on the back of the collar. excited i was able to get the blue on sale. definitely runs big  but the small fits me well!
I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.  this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store  salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.  i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte
This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference  i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem.
This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer  but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt  or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey  which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!
I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings  special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
I bought this sweater in the navy blue and love it! it's soft and not itchy  and the tie back detailing gives it that extra something special. i'm 5'7 and 38 d  waist line 27/28 inches  and the size m is a perfect fit! wore it yesterday to my son's 3rd birthday party with jeans and received a lot of compliments.
So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
I ordered a size small. i am 5'7" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high  so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft  thick  stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.
True to size and lovely colors. bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.
I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange  without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful  however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath  but it is so sheer you need something.
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan  but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it  and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.
I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons  but i may be able to
Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!
I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!
Hi   i bought these in moss for both of my daughters. they love them. the material is substantial and washes beautifully. the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws. i would recommend this to a thin figured girl.
This is my second pair of these jeans (i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement). wear them all the time. i did go up one size to get a better fit (i don't exactly have slim thighs--ha!)  but other than that  they are pretty perfect!
Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th
This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size  but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink  which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers  which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic  but it's snug.
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.
I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color  but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up  right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.
Got this in wine  very pretty and soft. but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
I love this top. it comes with its own camisole. the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect.
Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material  i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!
I was really excited to get these pants but was somewhat disappointed when i received them. the fabric and color are great but i was expecting a more traditional cut after examining the ones shown on the model. i need to size down on boyfriend cut jeans  and i would have initially  but the description doesn't say anything and the model doesn't look like she's wearing a boyfriend cut  so i didn't . now the size i need is unavailable so i am returning these  sigh. i so wanted to keep them.
I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous
I have only worn this 3 times with no signs of pilling  yet. it is good for cool spring days/evenings. for me  it'll be the cooler 3-seasons sweater. i wear a size large and it fits properly. i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves. i think a slim sleeved shirt/blouse would work equally well. while i like the idea of the pockets  i think they'll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming. i removed 1 star due to the high price and i receive
I am in love with this tunic  i wear it with everything  jeans  leggings and just tights! super comfy  quality design. runs a bit large but i like that.
This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it  is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion  this dress  with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves  would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length  along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably  i sent it back.
This dress fits and flatters a curvy silhouette. size medium length is perfect for my 5'7" frame. utterly comfortable and so many compliments!
I ordered a large and it was skin tight  if that's the look you're going for..
Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip  but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.
I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area  however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.
This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!
I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.
Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.  very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.  the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online  was slightly disappointed with that  but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no "oh she is wearing that jacket again"....  the forest green is rich and elegant.  the fit is true to size  but this is not a fitted jacket  it falls more straight  but the peplum is a gorgeous accent.   a classic with impeccable quality!
I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that
I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller.
I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3"  120 lbs. 34b  and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut  not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade  with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea
Bought this for a summer wedding  it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!
I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9  155lbs.  sadly  i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference  i am 5'3" and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair  it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall.
In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back  but front was just too clingy. back it goes.
This top is extremely well done. it looks classy and timeless. i tried on the white version in store  but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer.
This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.
I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously  seriously see-through.
Got this on sale in black and red  and have only worn the black. quality is poor  seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
This skirt is figure flattering and stylish  while still being work appropriate. i like the length as well.
Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.
Love the material  pockets  length (i wear petitie - i'm 5'3) etc. i usually wear a medium  but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!
Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.
I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure  and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store  it was closed in the front with the pin  which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model  so it looked fantastic. however  when i tried it on myself  it wasn't quite the same.
This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.
I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.
In the picture it looked to be a structured blazer  but when i tired it on (i got an extra small) and it was too big.
In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.
I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice  flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap  and i do not have a flat stomach  so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.
I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews. i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy. yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days. but it hits right at the waistline without being too short. super vibrant colors.
I ordered this in a 4 (34b  140lbs.  5'8") because it looked like it would run big  and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy  so i returned it. that said  the material is gorgeous!  as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust  this dress would have been a
I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.
I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style  but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded  and the trim of the shirt curl over  so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.
This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting  feminine  and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise  which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite  the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you  retailer  for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.
I got this number in the turquoise and i hadn't expected the skirt to be ribbed! are they all like that? retailer was out of the petites  so i sized down in a regular instead -- yeah  that didn't work. i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up. the bust was scandelously tight. in the end the dress wasn't flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me -- the proportions were off somehow. it's just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul
I am 5'2" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give)  but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so  it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter.
I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.  i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it's
The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.   sending back
Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent  with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long.   so comfy you can wear it as a robe!  looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large  which i like in a bulky cardi.  super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price.
This dress is beautifully made  but it does not flair slightly as in the photo  it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.
This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed  so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days  but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!
I am really impressed with the workmanship of this jacket as well as the "fit." it really does fit me well and has a "cool" look. the quality is really worth the price. thank you retailer!!
I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen  appliqu  pockets  raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium  for reference i am 5'4"  135 and usually wear a six or a small.
This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look. the dress especially in this color  hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half. it is not too short and goes past my knee. i am 5'3'.'' the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on.
The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it  but when i turn to the side  you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end  not the most flattering.
If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look
The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized   therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders   the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .
I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans  unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure  i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.
This shirt is absolutely beautiful. however  it runs very small. proportion-wise it's okay in the shoulders  bust  and back but it's too short! definitely order up!
Perfect top! the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be! love!!!
I don't know that i'll keep this  although i really want to. i love the style and the fabric  and the length is perfect for me (i'm 5'3" and i ordered the petite length - it hits me below the knee). as another reviewer mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch. luckily for me  that wasn't an issue.    my trouble is this: the liner stops just above the slits on the side  and it's way more noticeable in person than in the photo. the liner is sewn in and yo
This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life  not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s
This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches  it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style  not trendy so it wi
I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it. i was worried it might look like a "sack" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner.
I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.
I'm disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo
Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
I was so excited to buy it online  but it come in a small plastic bag  and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got  so i had to return it
This can take you from office to casual afternoon. i got the plaid print in store. it is much nicer in person than in the picture. very cute neckline and detailing. i'd say true to size  slightly large. i wore my regular size and it fits fine without looking too large.
I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web  i immediately ordered it. on the website  it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater  i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders  which supposed to look modern...well  the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.
Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
This is a really beautiful dress  the pictures don't capture it well enough. was looking for a comfortable shift dress that is versatile  this fit the bill. for reference  i am 5'3" and weigh around 113 lbs  i got an xxs...and it was a bit baggy  but shift aren't supposed to be tight. also has some fun details! look forward to wearing this!
Beautiful tee and cut with a classic  simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"  132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all  with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee.
I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30" arms  all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra
I love this dress! it's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals  or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels. the fit is spot on and very slimming  and i like that the length isn't too short as well.
Bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you.
I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting  so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight  but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath  which adds a nice touch.  great length  not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"  124 lbs  and 32b.
I ordered the black and white  and the pattern is just as pictured (so cute!)  but after reading the other reviews  i ordered a size up. and i'm glad i did. the m would have been snug  but the skirt in the l fit me as pictured on the model. i am i b cup  and the top was snug but not unflatteringly so on me. it's still a dress i can wear to work and even wear a tank underneath if i wanted to. overall  i'm incredibly happy with this one; i'm fairly straight  though  so i can see how this might be
Cute romper  love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy  and is staticky! for the price it should be better quality. also i'm fairly short and hits high on the leg. not sure how anyone taller could make it work.
Super soft  light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.
The red of the cape is a deep garnet. really pretty with the beige lining. it's loose enough that it feels and flows differently than a sweater. the boiled wool isn't itchy but keeps you warm on a fall day. the one snap lets you easily take it on and off. i'm 5'5" and 125lbs. the xs fit perfectly without being too tight. i've gotten a lot of compliments on it.
The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is  i am currently 33 weeks pregnant  and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now  over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good  but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy  but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely
I wanted to love this top  but had 2 major problems with it. first  it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt  which was terribly unflattering. second  the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.
Maternity like  and although the back is really cool  there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.
Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress  too much fabric  it just hung with  no form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quite  a bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on.   sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was very  thin.  recommend with caution to sizing.
I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have
This dress is gorjuss!! i thought i would be in between a 10-12  but after trying on the 8 in the store--i'm a perfect 10. i was a little nervous about the price  but then i said  "treat yoself!" and made the leap and didn't look back. i felt so confident wearing this to a wedding and received so many compliments. i wanted a dress that made me feel sexy  without showing so much skin--this achieved it all! make the purchase--you won't regret it :-)    i'm 5'8  195lbs and the 10 was spot on!
I love the lacey design of this top. however  it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better  but this size was too short. in addition  the lace didn't lay very flat  and there were lose threads all over. overall  not worth the price.
This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews  because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back  there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful  but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully  and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall  one of my new favorite tops.
On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.
Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
These are the cutest prints  but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt  which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless  both my appropriate size  which i still felt was too short  and the size up  which hit at a flattering spot  were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size  the shirt runs very wide.
As other reviews noted  this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality  but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7"  and if i were any less  i don't think this would work for me at all.
Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.
I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
I love this t-shirt. i fabric is soft yet has a nice weight to it. it is comfortable  yet sexy.
So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.
Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather  i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous  but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft  has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long  but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.
This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top  and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust  but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend  but know that sizing is off.
When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture  but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier  but not what i envisioned. t
This top has a flattering shape. the neckline is low  but not too low for work  and it flares a bit at the bottom. my only complaint is that it is short. i have a longish torso and this shirt hits right at the top of my pant's waistline. i just prefer tops to be a bit longer  but it's still a cute top.
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.
Loving this top! feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt  but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work. easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it! it's fraying a tiny bit on the front  but i think that adds to the not-so-precious vibe. i'm 5'10" 160# and the m works great!
I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.
Beautiful shirt  hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.
This sweater is very cute. i got a medium  i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.
The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally  i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more  but this dress is so cute and flattering  i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate  but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however  its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally
The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall  so i bought it a size smaller than normal  but it fits  so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy  and it kind of camouflaged that  which is always great!
When i was finally able to find my size available online  i didn't hesitate. i am 5'4"  123lbs  34d and size 27 jeans. i originally ordered a small...wow! was i surprised it was too small  and cropped. i returned and ordered a medium  received today...and i have to say  i was super happy. it fit perfect  in fact it fit much like how the model's fit in the photographs.
I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape  but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!
While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.
This is the most beautiful dress i've ever owned. the detail is exquisite. i never write reviews and felt i had to for this dress. i love it!  the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment  though!
I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr
This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
Got this for my wife for christmas and she is very happy with it. the size is perfect for her and she regularly orders things as a medium from this store.
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!
If your looking for a nice quality basic tee  this is it. nothing special  but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2"  35a/b bust  28 waist  39 hips.
This top is a very comfortable  very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front  which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!
This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion  even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj
I love this dress! the fabric and overall design are beautiful. however  the dress fit runs small  at least for me. i ordered a size 10 based on the reviews. i have another byron lars dress in a size 8 that fits well. i kept the dress because it is so pretty.
I picked these off of the rack at retailer  mainly because i loved the navy  black and brown combo of the squares. i tried on the medium  because they looked on the small side  even though i usually wear a size 4  or small in pants. good thing too  these fit really well so they do run small  albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my 5'3" frame. i could have used a petite for length if they had been there  but they didn't. that's ok  i don't mind rolling them up  it makes a statement i like. ye
I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t
I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said " [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric." this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav
Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater  did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus  it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.
I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
However  i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...
Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.
Great wardrobe staple! at 119  i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!
Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t
I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve
I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also  it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem  i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.
Like the other reviewer mentioned  this jacket has a very trim fit  so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.
I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
Ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but  the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
I knew when i bought this bralette that there was something special about it...the intricacy of the design is really pretty as is the style...but seriously - every single time i wear this bralette out (paired with a cute top or dress) i get tons of compliments from all of my friends. i never thought a bralette would spark so much conversation! aside from that it is super durable...i've had it for a year now  have washed it several times  and it is not stretched out at all or frayed aka it is gre
I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9" 145lbs with 38" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
It's a pretty  low-key  no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy  a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well  the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"  26 waist  36 hips)  perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer  but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like "thera " i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do
The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage  not at my natural waist  so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it  the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.
I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however  the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus  it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.
I have mixed feelings about htis top  it is a nice shape and comfortable  fits triue t o size  but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs  3-dd chest).
These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!
Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
I bought this dress in a store  and it suits the body better than on the picture. the pattern is exquisite and beautiful  i receive compliments every time i wear it. it is made of silk  which is a preferred alternative to polyester. but as other reviewers mentioned  it needs a slip  and for an expensive dress it should come with one  or should be fully lined. it is only lined on top. the peep hole is deep  but on my body  it doesn't gap much (i'm 5'7'' 142 lbs). a keeper for me for its beauty!
The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.
The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom  like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.
I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
I wanted to love this dress so much! but unfortunately it fell a little short of my expectations. the overall quality of the dress is great! it's very light  flowy  and super comfortable to wear. i just wish it was a bit more flattering. i debated on returning it since it didn't really give me any shape but the material was so darn comfortable and such an easy outfit to thrown on that i couldn't part with it.
I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas  it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
I felt like a 12 year old wearing my big sister's dress. it's a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large  hitting below my knees. the top part fits my large  34g chest nicely but it becomes a wide a-line through the hips. the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesn't flow softly over the body. the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward.  i love the black and white stripes. very striking. would love a top in these colors and fabric 
I love this dress. it is so cute! i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love. i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs  and medium fits perfectly. it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full. the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected  but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing  it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t
I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference  i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.
Great transitional top.  comfy and great fit.  i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small.  i usually buy medium.
I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!
I purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top. the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute. unfortunately it made my chest look too big... but the quality is really nice and i'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types.
As part of the over 60 crowd  i rarely wear dresses any more - but this called out to me.. and it didn't disappoint! i ordered the plum - true to size and and color. i usually wear a medium and it fit perfectly. i liked the previous review suggestion and i will also wear this with boots and t-shirt to get more use out of it as well as dressing up.it's a real keeper.
Ordered this as a gift.  she said it is great!  nice fabric  great fit.
This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
Feminine but not too fussy tee is a nice linen-like material. i got the white one which will go with a lot of my skirts  pants and shorts. unlike other reviewers  i didn't find it too short for me at all  but i am high-waisted. casual but with extras.
I love everything about this dress. cute  comfortable  easy to wear. it does wrinkle a little and it's not lined but otherwise  i love it.
So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day  and a complete stranger complimented me on it.
Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured)  the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.
Thank you  retailer  for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past  and i love it to bits!   i usually wear a size s or xs  but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.  (it's true that this sweater isn't lined  but to my mind  it would be a crime
The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail
The shirt was cute. i'm very petite and it ran very wide so didn't fit me well.
This dress is gorgeous in the photograph. and very pretty when it arrived  however  it is very dark in color. you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun. the fit was small. i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable  so sadly i had to return it.     i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging. that was almost enough to sell the dress. it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box. tissue paper and fol
This is much prettier and beautiful in person.  the fabric is light - but it's perfect for the summer
I wore this sailboat dress with blue wedges to a wedding and received tons of compliments from men  women and children. i love the material  pockets  and flattering cut. definitely iron it beforehand because it wrinkles.
If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
Such an adorable and comfortable dress! just love the fit  the design and the comfort of the denim fabric. it's quite flattering  fit's true to size and i can't wait to wear it to casual parties all summer long! highly recommend! lots of  options too with dressing it up a bit more with fun high healed sandals or a pretty shrug and just as nice to wear with flip flops or keds! i 5'5" and usually a size 4 and it fit true to size....grab it while you still can!
This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big  as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way  the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.
I ordered this top online in two colors  and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day  the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering  and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on
As a mom  items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash  comfortable to run around in with my kids  and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless. these fit the bill on all counts. they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light  flowing top.  these have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made.
I bought the cream version online  as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots  it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do  however  like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit  but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
I bought this top on the advice of another tall reviewer and i'm so happy that i did.  this is the perfect top for tall girls.  i did size down from my usual large to a medium. the top was still oversized  but in a very pretty way.  i love the material.  this top is so soft and extremely comfortable. the v neckline is very pretty and not too low.  i can see myself dressing this up with nicer pants for work or with skinny jeans for a more casual look.  if you are a tall girl  this top is a must h
I love this skirt  wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size  which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.  anyway  ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight  like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist  so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.
I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it  it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!
I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite  and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3" height and they're not skin tight  but fit like a glove (i have a 26" waist and 34" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful  but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions  which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa
This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
Dress is darling and well made. however  it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.
Ok you had me at the western scene. soft and comfortable. true to size. you can dress it up or down. just a great t shirt. recommend it! get it!!
I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging  having said that i sized up when ordering this  wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy  but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first  the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this
Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)
When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
These jeans are so great  i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out  despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!
Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.
The fabric is so thin  i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky  it's cotton-ey  and i suspect it will get "stuck" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....    however  i'm such a sucker for a pre
Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up  they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.
I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better  but also try a 27.
Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge    does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me    extra small is like a medium    not a sky color   like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath    better for taller larger sized people
This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.
I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite  one 00. the style  color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall  however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
I love j brand  however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me. they were perfect from the knee up  however they stuck out too much at the bottom. a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect. i had to return them.
This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.  the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly  i tried the medium as well  and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference 
I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large  i usually wear a large  and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad  it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up  the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also  the actual neck part was tight. for reference  i am 5'3"  108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.
These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels.
This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a "dress". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.
Love the cute cat pattern and quality of the blouse. unfortunately the front was too short and the back didn't fall properly. also  i found the arms to be tight. i'm usually an xs and a size 2 in maeve blouses. i would've ordered the the 4 but it's sold out. definitely size up if possible.
I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it  the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.
This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size  but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch  try on and return in store...this went back.
I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.
I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.
I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress  church dress. however  it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
Okay  so this top has its redeeming qualities  i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this  it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton  not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though  wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav
The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly  the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly  as i stood looking in the mirror  the dress simply read "nightgown". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went.
I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.
I was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store. i'm normally a size 2 but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms  so found a size 4 to be just right. it's longer and a bit wider than the size 2 everywhere else  but given the design  i thought it was fine. the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever. if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders  sizing up is a must. lengthwise  it fit me like it does on the model. (i t
Beautiful pale colors. there is too much room under the arms and at the sides but it will be an easy alteration. plan on wearing with skinny jeans.
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.
Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side  but still sexy  and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.
I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy  but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide  just awful.
Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt. super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well. a great transition piece.
Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.
I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these  either. i have slim legs- if you don't  i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
I adore this maxi! the fit  style  pattern (black motif)  machine washability  everything! fits tts (got my usual size s for 5'7"  125lbs). i would say that the length is appropriate - some are super long on me  and i'm not one to wear heels. i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug - my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest - no problem with this dress! i think it's perfect piece for spring/summer/fall and dressing up or down. my one slight
I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy  maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a "cheap polyester" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well.
The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.
I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer  but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware  this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge
This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.
Gorgeous  soft (yak hair  whaa?)  versatile sweater. lean fit  not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops  so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too  but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8"  140 lbs  34c. i'll wear this with everything  mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots.
I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.    still looking for the perfect dress...
I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult  but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.
I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly. i love this blouse.
Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago  and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday  and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they
I saw this dress online  and i thought it was perfectly cute! however  once i tried it on at home  it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning  and once i got it on  the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back  and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.
I have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger. i like the coral color the best for its versatility. the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic. i especially like the back  the stitching is already very flattering  but then the pleats really add an extra touch. the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longer-especially with it being a cashmere piece. i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way  which would make it much too short an
I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing  i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length  not too short or long! going to order a second color  i have the plum and love it.
I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.
Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is  and heavy .and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium  it was roomy.
Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.
Comfortable  stretchy fabric. i ordered the xs and will probably take the sides in at least a couple of inches for a snugger fit...the fit is looser than it looks on the model.
Love love love this sweater! lots of compliments as well :))
First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
Really cute top  normally order a s or xs. based on reviews  i ordered a m and good fit.
This top light and airy  which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however  this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.
I love these pants! comfortable  light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person  but can't really complain about that too much!
Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"  135 lbs  34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly  while the ribcage area is a little snug  but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i
This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large  arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
Gorgeous  but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
Love the muted orange color and the design. it's lightweight and will be perfect for fall days!
This top is one of my favorites  i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer  and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me  i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.
This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.
I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6  and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist  not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy  but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.  i only wish this came in solid white (o
This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality  but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit  just wasn't as striking as i expected.
Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting  but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.
I brought this shirt for a vacation  it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear  however  after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money.
I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell
I really wanted to love this. sadly  the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly  it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally  good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the "poor man's pineapple top." i couldn't agree more  sigh. i really did want
Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed  all the way around  perhaps purposely  but ratty looking  all the same.
I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups  i always imagine the sounds of the birds  waves rolling in  and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality  of course  is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo
Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up  they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist)  but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking  moving  and sitting  so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back
I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend  but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!
Beautiful color; however  the fabric did not work for me. tight on top  large on bottom.
I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted 
I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8  135  and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.
This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also  the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately  it has to go back.
It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?
I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a return...so happy imwas able to snag it. it is incredible. i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow! i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous. imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy  to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant to...embrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t
When i first tried this top on  i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black  and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer  along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!
I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!
Love this top! i was worried it would plunge too deep  especially because i'm quite flat chested - but it is perfect. i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too. that's the beauty of it. and the color is my absolute favorite right now ... :)
I just purchased this at my local retailer..the online pix does not do it justice! so pretty & delicate..casual  comfortable fitting..hits right at the hips...
I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.
These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small  which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be "flowy" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute  but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.
This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top  slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size  though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.
The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern  i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange  short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures  but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy  but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so  perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally  and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note  the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the
Love this--the chunky ribs  the retro striping  the conservative neckline. all of it. comfy  casual 70's-on-the-slopes vibe. leaving the house in it today wich maroon cords and chunky boots. so cute!
Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away "i love it" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a "blah" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice  doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'(" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o
The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l  but went with the m  and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.
I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually  i like all the new styles at retailer right now)  and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the
This shirt was on sale  and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap!
I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.
I love this dress! the design is simple  colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy  no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously  it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns  i will just buy them blindly.    a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe
I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer  will shrink.
This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher
Love these! so comfortable  feels like wearing pajama leggings! they're stretchy but don't lose their shape  and the fabric is super soft!
This top is lovely to look at and to wear... one to reach for frequently
I usually wear a medium  and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering  even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey  which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho  this is a cute transitional jacket.
I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me  this dress fit terribly. however  the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3" and about 117 with a really short torso  and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller  or maybe with a longer torso  i could see this dress being really lovely.
This coat is beautifully made and for $800 i expect no less. however  i should have checked other resources prior to buying. the color on this website is nothing like actual color of coat. i was expecting a nice dark red/wine as depicted on these photos. however  it is a bright magenta/dark fuscia more on the purpleish side that does not go so much with my wardrobe (even though i am a pink-loving person haha). i had hoped to pair it with the same skirt shown here and the peony sweater that was i
I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
Saw this jacket online and decided to search in store for it! i found it  and although it definitely looks more mustard in the picture online compared to the bright yello it really is  i felt it fit very well! it runs large  i usually am a size 6  however  i ended up buying a size 4 for a more fitted cropped appearance. the material is heavy but made very well  and feels great on! i recommend this blazer for any female that wants to brighten her closet up for spring!
Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.
I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
Cute design  the fabric drapes well  conceals many possible figure flaws  and has an upbeat  easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes  which worked out just fine. great dress!
The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work  but not in my workplace.
Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.
I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.
The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
I was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater  but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots  i am sold! it is so soft and full of movement. it has a very unique design. the purple color is gorgeous and inviting. i will enjoy this sweater all winter long!! i am usually a small/medium and the medium fits a bit big  but looks beautiful on. the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal.
I love this top! i'm 5'7''  135 lb and the small fits well (probably could have fit in the xs). it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom. i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe. highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average t-shirt.
This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.
This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.
I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time.
I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"
If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.
I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.
When i ordered this online  i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope  it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled  or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.
I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on  but within a day of wear  i noticed significant pilling  which made it appear much older / worn.
First  the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top  but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs  and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest  and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture  the top appears to have a white background  but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8"  145  and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top  and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering
This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.  it is fitted  but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis  this dress is a winner!
This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference  i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs  it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant!
This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle  which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.
I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so  when you wear the necessary base layer  the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea
I ordered these pants in black and green. the fit of the pants is perfection. they feel amazing and are so flattering. they do run a full size small. i'm consistently a size 6 in all pants (typically wear paige  joes  and frame and always a 6) but i had to get these in an 8. the 8's feel great though so i think they're just a full size small.     secondly  the green color is not at all what's pictured. the green is hunter  not olive  and much less versatile. i'll be returning the green pants.
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.
I'm in love  i'm in love  and i don't care who knows it. i bought this vest on a whim and i'm so glad i did. it's so soft and cozy. the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well. i've tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste  but this was not bulky at all. warm and hangs well. i am 5'5"  135lbs  curvy/athletic frame and the small was just right. try this vest on...i promise you will be in love!
I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
My kids gave me this blouse for christmas in my usual size 6. it was so tight through the chest  shoulders and arms. i ended up having to exchange it for at size 10! there was barely any difference in the size 8. unfortunately  i now need to have the sleeves shortened  but as this blouse is so cute  it's worth the effort.
Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.
Cute and comfortable. not sure i'd say it's worth the full price as it's not a very heavy jacket. it did suit my needs though and was otherwise what i was looking for  so i kept it and have enjoyed wearing it.
I'm 5'7"  135 lbs  slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.
5'7"  34c  28 jeans  size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular  knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything  the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over
Usually retailer's designs run small for me  but this large fits great. super comfortable  long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size  it may seem to sit funny  but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-)
In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.
Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made  fresh  styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.
I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!
I love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i don't want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants
I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.
I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
I love the pilcro stet pants & want them in every color  every season! please retailer  never stop making these  pants. i also love the "new addition to the family": the pilcro capri pants & would love every color of these too!
...on this great vest. i wear it all the time. it's soft  pretty  warm and durable. love!
This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal  but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit  the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.
I bought the black version of this dress. looks exactly like the picture and is true to size.
This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings  and is also a great look with my casual denim  paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.
I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.
They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.
I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really  nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am  5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it  would have ruined the details of the dress. they were  backordered on petites in my size  so  i just returned it.
This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale  so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size  what can i say its a simple top  well made and so soft.
I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt  which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still  the quality seemed to be good.
I am here online to buy this pant in both colors. i tried it on today in store in regular lengh   but am opting for petite size. i am 5'2. i could have purchased the regular length  which hit me above the ankle  but i think p will be more flattering and better for summer.    the pants are a woven material  and kindof shiny!? the pants also may be a bit see-thru in sunshine due to the structure of weave. that said  i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional. i may
This is a beautiful dress. however  it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also  i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.
I have this suit in the "tile" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the "mint" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the "v" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result  my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad  because the
Love this blouse  it;s super comfy  looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small.
So happy this came back into stock! beautiful trench! love the flared skirt. the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast. it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit. a must!
These pants fit true to size. i have a small waist and curvy hips  and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie  these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg. the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall. the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points. i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea
I tried this top on in-store in red and lavender. i love it! yes  it is big  but it is still really cute. if you are between sizes  go down a size. i am 5'5" 34b and went with an xs in the red. it appears to fit in the front but looks larger in the back  which i think the other reviewer was getting at.
Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.
The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric
This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10" with broad shoulders and slim  and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition  the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.
I ordered the geometric  blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately  it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting  bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference  i'm 5'4" 120lbs 34 a.
Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch
Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!
These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts  but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0  but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2  so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist  but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee
I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it  but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon  because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.
I love  love  love this top! the color is beautiful  a pinkish-orange  about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big  i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2  i'm almost 5'7" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first  once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely  so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning 
This top was very pretty when i got it  but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice  and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.
I am allergic to wool and have a hard time finding winter sweaters. was really excited when i read material content on this item only to be disappointed upon arrival to note that sweater is 10% wool. also found it to be very tight in arm area. for reference i am 5'10"  130 lbs. and would say have slender arms! cute design that will work for some!
I have a curvy figure  and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6  not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.
The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately  the 2nd suit i received was also "off center". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.
This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l  if not a medium. sadly  it's going back :( otherwise  it's high quality and a beautiful design.
These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material  color true to picture.
Couldn't make it work  even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan  like dirty vintage. "drop" waist is not dropped at all  just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust)  then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy  curvy waist  but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a  tried xs)
I really liked these jeans. i had to return though. they run small. i normally wear a 27 and could have gone for a 28 in these. maybe it was because i went for the petite. they can run a bit smaller.
Love this so much. it's beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it's a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings!
This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.
This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!
This is a very lovely sweater dress  it looks just as pictured and true to size. i ordered mine online and was very happy with this purchase. the material of the top white portion is very soft and cozy and bottom peach chiffon material has sparkly stones. sweater dress is very pleasant on the skin and looks refreshing. recommend!
It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure  this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.  i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta  but definitely needed a large.  i ordered the "lavender" color  which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead.
I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs
I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.
I tried these jeans on in my regular size and they seemed way too big  but still kinda cute. i went one size down and suddenly they were the most adorable  comfortable jeans that i've every had (and i have a lot of jeans!). i love them! they are very soft with gorgeous fading around the pockets. they are button fly which is unique. i got them on the sale on sale price and they are well worth every bit and more. i plan on wearing them with boots although high heal shoes should be beautiful with t
Great quality  beautiful print  definitely a steal given its current sale price. it does run large. order a size smaller. works perfect with a belt!
The model looks awesome in this cute top  but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference  i'm 5'7 " 140 lbs.  and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric  yet the back is stretchy. in theory  it's pretty  but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.
I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
Got the blue & white striped in xs. fits perfectly. the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit. it's very comfy and good quality fabric.
Hi  when i received this top i tried it on  looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.
This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight  will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d  27  35
I have always had a thing for velvet  and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured  but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3". they can be dressed up  but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide
I'm 5'8 140 lbs and small worked perfectly. great dress!
When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store  i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry  or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite. super soft with just the right amount of stretch. they keep their fit and don't stretch out. the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering. i'm petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable.
Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.
These were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12  but i had to squeeze to get them to close. they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.
This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..
When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that  but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.  i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model  definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.
I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau
I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
I loved the colors on this dress  but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders  but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back
For me  the v was too deep on this one  but the colors are beautiful.
I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso  this would work great. if not  unfortunately  its not great - tear
I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.
I ordered this dress  and loved  loved it. beautiful  great fabric. the length was even perfect for me and i'm 5'4". i am usually a size 8  but ordered up to a 10 because i am a little woman with the exception of my chest. i have ordered dresses before from retailer where i had to order certain dresses a size larger and they worked. unfortunately this time  it wasn't to be. tried the dress on and it fit nicely until the side zipper got to my chest area. i would have ordered another size lar
Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why  but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
Ordered a l and xl  the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack  so it's going back.
I ordered this for my mom in color "blue motif". i could not see a difference online between the colors "brown motif" and "blue motif" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven  but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t
I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !
These are very well constructed  medium weight  besutiful leggings.
I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering  it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric  drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.    i am 5'5" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small.
I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s  so i went with a medium. fortunately for me  this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large  i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality  the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!
I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant  cute also ;-) rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest. the sloping longer hemline toward the
So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.  fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good  sleeves are a not too tight.
The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the "fold over" portion was not necessary.
I bought this in store without trying it on. bought my typical size xs. the armholes are cut very low  as is the front neckline. it has an overall slightly slouchy fit. i definitely could not wear this to work without a camisole underneath. otherwise  i really like the style  and the black and white striped color way will go with alot.
The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.
Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome. for those worried about it being see-through  i'm wearing a black bra and you can't see it. it's the perfect weight. super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores.
I ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge.
You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!
Super cute dress  the material is not what i expected. it's stretchy and the slip is tight fitting too. the look is super cute though!
This sweater is really cute  and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it's a deeper blue than i was expecting  and the pocket is not a "rust" color as depicted online. it's definitely closer to red. other than that  i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch  and it is true to size  and not too short.
If there ever was the perfect feminine dress  this would be it .
I could not resist this top. it is super cute  the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.
This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi  the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me  this adds to the unique quality
Love this sweater! warm  cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!
Order a size down
Nice  easy to wear dress!
This dress is flattering and seems to be made well. the polka dots add interest. i am usually a 2 and did go up to a 4 in this. .
Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
Love this vest! i am not a huge vest person  and was worried about finding something to go with this  but i have been able to match it to so many cute thing. the pattern and quality are great. it runs big. if you're between sizes definitely go for the smaller size.
I wanted to love this dress. i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive. when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought. i'm not sure if i misunderstood the images  but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over  i just thought that the fabric had a texture. the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me. i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips  but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am. i think this w
Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys  the 27 fits very comfortably.     i"m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.
This skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large. i am a size 4  xs in retailer. my waist is 28 inches  5'7  140 pounds. the skirt is touching the floor. even if i wear high heels  i will have to wear it up my waist. the elastic band is weak  not sure if it will hold the skirt. it should be ok with a belt. i still recommend it cause it's so pretty.
I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality  slim fit  high-waisted jeans  either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige  thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft  yet has that little "snap" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there aren't those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27  which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a
I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green  which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings  but they are very secure.     i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru
Love this top  it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks  which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online  but not with this top. it is soft velvet  silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up  but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.
Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1  119#  32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store  and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes  or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage  but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro
Per reviews and from looking at retailer employee pics on instagram  i sized down to a small  cinched with a wide leather belt  topped with a cropped jacket  added some shooties and a necklace. when winter comes  this will go with my knee high suede boots  long wool coat and chunky scarf. this does not look like a table runner on me like the model shot and previous reviews imply. now i am tempted to buy the other color. i'm 5'3" 135# 36d 38/28/35 and purchased red melange in size s.
Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!
This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs  hourglass  curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite. (i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available). the dress lo
I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.
This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing  so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.
Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
The embroidery on the side is cute  and they're nice and airy for hot days. however  the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also  they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.
I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!
This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors  fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site.   .   i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage  not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support  and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w
This top is super cute  however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the "flutter" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!
The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however  the bottoms run so small. for reference  i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start  both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!)  i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly  i'm giving up and returning.   only order this suit if you're super  super tiny on the bottom.
Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.
I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug  but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.
The red is so pretty in-person. i love the details on the sleeves... only complaint is the fit is pretty boxy and couldn't size down because it is borderline to short in length. did buy it today and we will see if it work out!!
So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general  and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it  it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral  material is thick enough for fall  california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite  xs). i say go for it!
Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks  skirts  culottes  jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4''  130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.
I'm 5'1" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.
Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.
This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops  and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though  which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp  it actually looks bigger. regardless  i love it and was o
This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front  which fit nicely  but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps  i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!
This dress is so soft  flowy and comfortable! the material is very smooth and silky. i'm hoping it holds up well over time with washing. i am 5"5  120lbs and i ordered a xs. the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly - just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits. i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did  it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big.
This is a stunning dress. fits true to size  very high quality  has a very flattering shape  and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.
Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did  so i'm stoked.
Thank goodness i looked at everyone's reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it wouldn't have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!
When i saw this dress online  i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it's faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5'4  34b  27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which isn't typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress
The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.
This little number is really cute  i got it on sale  after i looked at it  went home  slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0 i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work  or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear.
Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !  it caught my eye right away in the store.  perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.
I tried these on in the store  and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)
This is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren't fans  but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103  32 b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area  however  a different story. because it's boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly
I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture  but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture  it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though  so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
Very soft material  probably will pill quickly but it is super comfortable. it is also very low cut; it works perfectly for me for breastfeeding because each of the front panels can be easily pulled to the side. a cami underneath is required  the model definitely isn't wearing a bra. i'll be wearing a nursing tank under this. definitely a good print for summer.
This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste  it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand  usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top
A very versatile and cozy top. would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day. what a fun piece for my wardrobe!
This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.
Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
Love the design and the gold color  but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large  it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.
I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version  but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale.     i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.
I bought this blouse in two different colors -- the orange and ivory -- and kept the orange. the style and fit were very flattering. the drape of the fabric  along with length (hitting right below waist) and sleeves are very flattering. i am 5'4'' and 118lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. i have muscular arms and the capped sleeves are perfect. i returned the ivory due to the sheerness of the fabric. it is quite sheer  which is a problem if i wanted to wear this for work. also  you can see the dark
I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top  but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7  116 lbs  32a. it is very cute  but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly  could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining  simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return  try the size up  but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets  and would be a fun dress to wear f
I got this jacket thinking it was going to look different on me. while i ended up returning it  it fit me nicely and was good quality. it just wasn't the look i was going for.
It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.
The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium  size 6 around 5' 8  and i chose the m/l  which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric  which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care  i am exchanging for another one in small.
This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy  seems well made and fit nicely. but  although it fit technically  i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all.     the suit is kind of a neoprene material  so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit  so i think even though it isn't lined  it might not be see-through  but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit  i think it
Love this dress  it's comfortable  and it can be worn casualties or formally.
This is just as it looks. a minimalist  elegant  dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight  so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it.
This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference  i'm 5'6"  120 lbs  34c  and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted  and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.
This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me  and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.
Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new "action shots" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.
I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft  like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.
Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
I bought the blue & black  they are great basics. got the small. i am normally a extra small in retailer.
I too will be returning this sweater. love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.
I ordered this shirt last week  it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs  i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors  i'd order another one in a minute!
Love this & so cute to have t-shirt with additional details. usually get medium size in blouses but liked the fit of the large better.
I adore a good vest  so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often  but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it  took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl  and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line  and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin  or even w
The dress fit fine  with two exceptions. first  i am 5'1"  and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground  so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure  which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective  so sent it back  but unfortunately  the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit
The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.
What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist  it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work  but the previous reviews were exactly correct  the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit. the bottom has lots of fabric  which wouldn't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit  then the bottom becomes overwhelming. i am 5'5" and 115 so i have a slim build and couldn't get the bodice to zip in a small. the medium would have needed altering  which wouldn't have fixed the extra fabric on th
I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(
This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in
I would have l loved to keep it but even the 0p was big. i have pretty broad muscular shoulders and back and i was swimming it. i wish retailer would stock more petites. i would repurchase if the 00p was available.  they always sell out very very quickly and they never restock.
I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick  and the pattern is just ok. didn't do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.
I took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did! i got the regular m and it fits perfectly. it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great. as a petite  the regular m fit perfectly - heals or no heals. its comfy and lovely!!!!!
"vegan suede" makes these sound fancier than they are. i love them and they're super cozy and a nice change from plain leggings  but they're just a microfiber legging which makes the price about 20 too high even for retailer. still... i'm sure i'll wear them plenty. i usually wear a 2-4 and the xs fit me  which makes me think they'd be too large for a size 0/xs.
I bought this to wear in the warm climates  when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car  it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much  going to by another one similar and have on again!
I loved this top when i tried it on in the store. i was very close to buying  but i knew my sister would want  so i moved on. it is a great fitting top. i am 5'7  125lbs  and the small fit perfectly. i do question how well this top will fit petite people.
I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet  so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.
I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer  but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it..."classic " "fancy " "jackie o." are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e
I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small  but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs  looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!
I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me  but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front  back  or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap  and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d
Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.
The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work  and looks great with a pair of jeans.
This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.
I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good  will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers. what a pleasant surprise. i will shop often!
I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it's cute  but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews.
This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned  it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.
I love love this top. i was on the fence about it since it runs large and is loose fitting  very loose. i tried m  l  and xl. i usually wear xl but bought an l in this. i tried m  it was loose around the mid-section but fitted at the top. i wore them with fitted skinny pants and the top looks amazing. perfect for summer. the armholes also look flattering - not too big. i like turquoise. i didn't find yellow in the store  so bought green and white. it does need some ironing.
I ordered my usual size s in the purple print. this peplum top style  colors/pattern will go easily with pretty much anything.. shorts  pants  jeans & skirts. wear for casual or dress it up. for me the fit is tts. armholes provide good coverage & length is fine. the top has a bit of stretch & doesn't feel restrictive. the waist is banded & a little loose which is fine. don't like tight fitting waists on tops. i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer. the skirt
As a curvy  short gal  finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work  and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like  and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!
I liked this shirt well enough to order in several colors  preferred it fitting loosely (5'1" around 100-105 size small). i always look for marine was able and this fit the bill  or so i thought; was so so dismayed to see that after one wash the dye had settled strangely into folds making it look like the shirt had cracks all over it. worse looking on the moss green but still apparent in the black  both no longer wearable.  i am forced to return the shirts but since i do like the shirts i am goi
A sales associate suggested this top and i'm glad she did. it's easy to miss at first!  -------------------  pros:  - beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.  - double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.  - lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.  - roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.  - great fabric. forgiving fit.  - can be dressed up or down.  - lengt
Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short  i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.
This is a dress worth paying full price for  based on the good construction and lacework. i got it for an office event  and although it is low-backed  the high neckline makes up for that! no jewelry necessary with the high collar. i am 5'10 and 135lbs  built like a column  so i got the 6. definitely not for full-figured women  unless you want it long. very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent.
This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store  but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy  i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation  i paired it with a white
I bought this blouse in ivory  which is almost white  just as pictured. it's pretty sheer (as shown in the pics) and the cotton lace insets show the top and straps of my bra. despite this  i'm keeping the blouse and will sort out how to wear it because it's so unusual and gorgeous! if black looks good on you (it's bad on me)  i'd probably go with that colorway over the ivory because it's easier to blend a black bra with a black blouse than a nude bra with an almost white blouse. the blouse runs
Not that i don't recommend  only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird  no kidding  kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit  so perhaps they run small?    i would get petite if you are usually a petite  the regular size bunched on the bottom  too long.    i am usually a 0p or 00p  or
I tried on the blue floral dress in the spring but found it too large on top. i liked the new red motif dress and sized down to a medium which fits much better.
I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.
I have had my little eye on this dress since it came out! lucky me i found it sitting pretty in my local retailer lost   found! it runs a tad big  when i first tried it on with the sleeves off-the-shoulder i was disappointed in the length (past my knees); but i tried it on again with the sleeves sitting on my shoulders ... so so darling
This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.
Runs large. very stretchy. nice wash. mine had more holes and fraying in the legs than i expected. i returned them because i got the wrong size and smaller sizes are sold out. otherwise a cute jean and with the sale  certainly worth it.
I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.
Boxy  short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...
I love the dress  fits as pictured   i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper  well made.
Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.
Love this top! not too low cut  drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.
This was pretty to look at: nice weight  lining  colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great  so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me  though...
When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me  but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well  the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.
This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.
This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great  the cut is nice  etc... however  the buttons are too big for the button loops  which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on  i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it  you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.
I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.
This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.
Cute and comfy. if you don't throw a leg out like the model above  it mostly reads as a skirt because the legs are so full. but it's really comfortable  and pairs well with a surprising number of tops
I really like these. they're not too distressed  and the frayed ankle looks great. not too casual that you couldn't wear them to the office. the length is perfect on me  (i'm 5'1) i can wear them with sandals and booties without having to roll them up. they do run about one size small. i'm 5'1  120 lbs  a slightly curvey petite and the 27 fit best .
This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap  rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.
I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"  36c  145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it  but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too
The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
I thought this would look great with skirts  but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops  but for this one i bought a medium  and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but  as i mentioned  it doesn't go with any of my skirts  so it's not worth looking for a small.
This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please  please bring it back!!
I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.
I've noticed this sports bra several times in my store-along with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didn't feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer. i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it. i like the back with the extra strappy open section  but that is where it ends. the fabric is not particularly flattering  and i didn't think the bra accentuated my chest. i do have a small bust size  but i have a lot of sports
This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality..   it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.  i cant wait to wear it this summer.
I pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together. the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on. and it's an awfully heavy jacket for the summer. but overall i love it and how i look in it.  i think it runs true to size.
I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs  though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute  the cut is just very strange.     for reference  the black and white is the small  the taupe is the xxs.
These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies  if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.
Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your "normal" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love
I just tried the blue polka dot one on at my local retailer. i'm 5'3ish  117#  34d-dd and usually wear a size 4 or xs in most retailer brands. i tried this in size 2 and had a better fit hence the runs large rating. this is a very plunging neckline. not work appropriate and i'm fairly notorious for being out there. the band in the back didn't hit right at my bra in the back so not sure what to tell you there. the shoulder straps are adjustable. there are 2 buttons so you can tighten it up a bit so y
I had high hopes for this top  as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
This dress is great! it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall. it is very comfortable. the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt. overall  i love it.
Great fit and style. i got the navy and the color is beautiful.
I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.
I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured  but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette  but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally  the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses  but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful  and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of
I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room  i could see through the entire shirt  front to back  before even putting it on. once on  i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on  it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while
I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute  flattering  and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this "baby doll" style  you'll love this.
The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on  i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise.
The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.
This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!
While the cut  drape  and shape of this dress are very attractive  seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however  the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly  thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.
I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun  and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top  i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back
I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy  have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big  i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall  highly recommended.
I am 5'3" 130lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly. the dress hugs my figure nicely.   unfortunately  i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work  at least for my own comfort level  but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date. i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress.
The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1"  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t
I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
The fabric is very nice on this wrap  but it wears like a blanket.
Great fabric  great fit  great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows  the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.
Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom  fit perfectly and she loved the details. did not complain of itching as with prior review. it is more blue than gray appearing the photo.
I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again. the dress is very comfortable and looks polished. i wore this dress for 12 hours and did not want to take it off. the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done. i am 5'5 and the dress hit me 2 inches above my knee. i highly recommend this dress  i received so many compliments.
I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded "button gape." it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!
I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.
This dress is lovely. feels like a dream...so comfortable and the lining is silky soft. i feel it runs a little large (as maeve has been this spring/summer) as i ordered a p0 and p2...the p0 fit (i am 5'4" about 118#.) i ordered the white hoping to take it on a beach vacation. it was just a little too delicate for my needs...i have two younger children. it seemed to be easy to snag or to make a hole in the more delicate woven areas of the dress. otherwise i really liked this dress a lot. too bad
The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1  92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted  the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly.
I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy  but not too big.
Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b  27" waist  and 36" hip and 5'3" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price.
This runs way big  i'm a size 8  purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.
The fabric of this dress feels like suede  i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the "but": the dress is cut straight down  no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on  like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself  and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses  and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu
The quality of this vest is outstanding  and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days  in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style  but i am 5'1"  100 lbs and i can carry it off.
This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange  which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice  hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details  the scallops  and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips  so get in the w
I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared  but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf  skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!
This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly  however  this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large  the length too short  and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit  since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.
Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white  flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!
The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.
I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color
Nice fabric  great color  would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves  take a pass--too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up "is she or isn't she" kind of way.
This suit was high quality  and a cute design. however  it is clearly made for a lean body type.
I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
I actually saw this dress on an associate and didn't like it. but as i was trying on other things  i saw my size hanging on a rack in the dressing room and thought - why not  just try it. glad i did! it is so flattering on and you can dress it up or down it's so versatile. i received so many compliments when i wore this  glad i gave it a try!
This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.
This top is really beautiful  but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband  i looked like a star trek villain.
Love this t-shirt  its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs.   the color is a little brighter than the picture.
I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great  butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately  they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly  but too big was a little too boxy.
I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me  the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.
Love love love! it's the perfect cozy  comfy piece for a bitterly cold day. and the color is such a nice shade for the dreary winter.
I like this dress a lot. it does not have much form but with a belt looks great!
I'm all over this trend  but this vest is quite thick/poufy  and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me  a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4" don't hesitate.
Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large  even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso  and this sweater fits just slightly cropped  so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.
I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.
Pretty cut out design. it is a great length for work but it is also unique enough to get compliments. the skirt seems true to size but the waist does not have a lot of "give." in this regard it may seem a little small.
I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these  however  is high quality and weighty  wearable in fall  but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red  dark pink  and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!
I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first  i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on  it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch  but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors  i'd buy them all lol.
I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.
I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly  though  it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos  which was ok  but i had to return it because of the size.
... runs large which is the opposite of what i see in the majority of others' reviews. since most reviews say it runs true to size i decided to purchased a size 28 which usually  it's the perfect size for me no matter which brand  fabric  style  etc. it always fits... well  not in this case. i should have gotten a size 27. i felt very disappointed because these pants are beautiful. i got the 40% off sale at the time and now can't exchange it since the price has changed and the product is unavail
This arrived just in time for the winter snow storm.  i was glad i had read previous reviews advising that it ran large  and that the gray sleeves are surprisingly attached to the sweater  and do not represent a separate top beneath the sweater.  i got a size small  and it fits perfectly. it's big and boxy but doesn't make feel like i look fat. with slim-fitting trousers - it's super stylish.
The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit  and drapes beautifully.    the top runs tts  but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.    this works for casual or dress. for dress  i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw  i bought this in black  which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black  it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.
The dress is too big. i got size 4  after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"  125 lb). it is too wide  not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady  but looks pathetic on me).     the pattern is too bright  much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately  it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.    the material is heavier than i expected.
I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled! as a short and curvy lady  i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts (but not too poofy)  and this one lies perfectly (does not make my hips look wide!). the colors are soft and very feminine  which also suits my style. it may seem like a springtime skirt  but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away.
These pants are so great  light  comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made  and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.
Love this dress. i'm wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall  casual outdoor wedding. i think it's fancy enough and can also be dressed down later.     i'm 6' tall and skinny  with large breasts and this dress fits. beautiful! not too much cleavage. :)    it's not real lace but no one could tell. great quality and nice weight to dress. great for dancing and spinning!
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
Love the warm color and soft fabric - paired with chic tights and ankle boots and it fits right into a more casual workplace.
I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted  so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.
Very pretty cardigan but it is huge! i ordered a large (normally xl or large) and it is so big! the shoulder seam comes to middle of my upper arm. i wanted to exchange it for a medium but they are out of stock. bummer.
I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s  depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape  i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff  and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't  it is very heavy  much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice  the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance  easily. back it went  boo hoo. if you are between sizes  i would size down  runs a bit big.
If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips  the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you. ---------- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops  and went with the m  and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms  i would recommended sizing down a size. ---------- i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5") rise jeans  then yes  you will
Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo .  2) you could wear this with almost any color top  black boots and youve got a great outfit!  3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.    cons  this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip  but seriously for this price it should be lined
This skirt material and quality is top notch. i'm not a "mustard yellow" fan but the color combo in this is just stunning! i'm 5'4"  125#  27/4 usually and picked a 4 in this which would have been correct. the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist. in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top. this would look beautiful on anyone approx 5'6" or over i think! oh  and the drape is beautiful  not super full.
I am a 36dd  10/12 in tops and 12/14 in bottoms.  i tried both the navy/red pattern and the green polka dot. color and patterns on both are gorgeous. the fabric is very comfortable and a nice fit on the bottom half. size large fit perfectly in the waist however i had gapping across the bust. size xlarge fit ok in the front of the bust  but was loose in the back  gapping at the neck  and the waist was very loose. cute and comfy but only recommended for smaller busted gals.
It really is a beautiful sweater.  the material is super soft and feels luxurious.  unfortunately  it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width.  maybe if i were taller  i could pull it off.
Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!
This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy  so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available  but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence  go for it. totally worth it..
I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale  and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice  and you can dress them up or down.
I bought these last year and loved them  however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short  even at 33". im 5'7" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal
Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking
Let me start by saying this skirt is beautiful quality. it is a stretchy material which makes it very comfy. i ordered a large because i am a size 8 (sometimes 10) in jeans. but - i get the waist taken in on almost every pair of jeans i have ever owned. my tailor calls me "kim k" lol. i was hoping i wouldn't have that same problem with this skirt but the waist is enormous (but fits my hips  thighs  and booty like a dream). i'm hoping a tailor can have the waist taken in. if i didn't have a small
Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky
This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops  sandals  wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.
I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.
This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok  will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.
Got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more. super comfy and flattering at the same time. i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well. i'm normally a 6-8 but i'm an 8-10 right now and the medium was perfect. i'm 5'6" and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings. a great shirt and i'll be sure to watch out for this one to come back. please restock!
The perfect flowy fall top! the material is thin so it may pick a little  but i love it.
Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact 
The back of this top is nice but it is very flowy. i ordered a small (32dd  normally a 4/6 in retailer tops) -- a smaller size would fit better but is not available. overall nice  but wish it came in a smaller size.
This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9  a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.
This has lovely embroidery of good quality  and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape  so size down.
Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side  but i read that many others had the opposite problem  particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me  it looks and feels great.
I have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favorite! the style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twist. i ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side  especially in the waist. this is one dress you need to have in your closet. if you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size.
I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south  and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen  but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful  more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore  but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!
Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.
I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
I'm 5'8" small 115 pounds. ordered the xs. this dress is gorgeous! my husband loved it! i tried several sticky bras... nothing worked. i'm 32dd   i gave up. if your ok with no support  you'll love this dress. sexy back  perfect length  so light!
My normal size m fit well but i wouldn't want it to shrink any. hangs well.
I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.
Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!
Fabric is soft cool and comfortable. love the sleeves as air circulates. this is perfect for new wide legs i purchased. many compliments and purchase inquiry when worn. purchased in two colors.
Very cute dress  just way too big. i ordered it online  wish i would have gone a size smaller.
I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8"). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!
Like a previous reviewer  i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots  so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops  however with a 34d chest (5'5" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t
I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great  and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs  which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m  but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips  fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically  if you're deliberating between s and m for this top  get
The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.
I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside
The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous  from the lace  to the sequins  to the rhinestones! that said  the details are not overpowering  yet more subtle. can't wait to wear this over the holiday season. sure to get tons of compliments!!
This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable  with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty  the curved hems are very flattering  and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts  as shown  or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange  yellow and green  and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!
This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
Loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering. i am a size 0/2 and 5' tall and have a 'bubble butt' and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a 24 they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect  tried on a 25 and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well. i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my
This dress fits very nicely  i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses  but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top  you can almost see it on the model if you look closely  the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back  you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck  leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (115 lbs  26.5 in waist) 30 dd).
These tights are wonderful  exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person)  definitely true to size  and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.
The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.
The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering  particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable  and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys  it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).
I love this dress. it is exactly my style  which is probably why i love it: girly  frilly  flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant  and it's plenty roomy to fit now  and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons  and the other reviewers touched on these as
The front and back of this square sweater are the same  and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice  but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped  so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted  but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
I'm 5'4"  32c and 125 lbs. i ordered the size 4p and while the color and fabric is pretty  the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps. it was also very tight across my ribs. despite ordering a petite  the hem was much too long. i ended up returning it.
Wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots. pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace. for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals. received numerous compliments wearing the first time  so purchased the navy one several weeks later. anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown. love
This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size (not petite). i am 5'1 and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees. i can wear it to work without leggings. the other thing i love is it has pockets! and it fits generously - i weigh 140 lbs and will usually fit in a medium (if i don't breathe) and a large (if i use a belt). but in this size (medium regular - i can breathe! and i need a belt. ergo - i don't feel like i need to
This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.
This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.
I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in
This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
This top is so pretty in the photos  but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size  but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made  so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference  i'm 5'5" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly  but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect  but i'll sa
This is a quirky  whimsical  uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is  a fun  conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts  very comfy  yes boxy  but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties  or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.
Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans  shorts  crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger  i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple  wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.
I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately  even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall  it's a cute dress but just not for me.
Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
I ordered size large and find this to be way too oversized  wide  long and unattractive on my frame. the print is just okay but since it doesn't wow me  i'm returning.
I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
I saw this online and said to myself  next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"  136 pounds  the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to
I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.  i ordered all 3 colors  and they just arrived........love love love !!!  they are soft  comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.  the understated ruffled details add the special "something" that is so retailer.  they are sophisticated yet pretty.  the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.  the plum/purple is a rich  unique and pretty color.  the navy is a perfect "denim" color.  a fantastic basic
I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me  but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25 26  or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately  there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....
Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short
I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however  the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in.  and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material  i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress  even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.
I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out
I wear stuff like this a lot so naturally i got this one. i love it and i think it's flattering however it wrinkles easily and also when i hand washed in cold water it shrunk a little which super irritating  but i'm going to wear it anyway. i think it can be worn with many things so it'll stay in rotation a while.
Very pretty  romantic
Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small. i returned it.
This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
Ordered this jacket in the holly color thinking it would be brown per the photo but when it arrived it was more olive green. it is a beautiful  well-made jacket but i already have two olive green jackets?don?t need a third. if they bring this jacket out in brown i will definitely order. i order the xs and it fit perfectly.
Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle  such a bummer  sleeves are much longer  and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger  in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it  but consider the mentioned if buying.
Well...this is "on me" as i saw this hanging in the store  but way off on my size which is xxs petite.    i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.    both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no "flow " just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.    this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes
These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it
I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.
This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.
This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner  to a wedding our just to feel special on
This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.
I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.
This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5"  112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs  perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.
I tried on a regular size at the store  and definitely need petite (5'1.5'  115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale  and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot  where hte muscles meet. there is alining  so not see-through. length was too long  why i need petie  also loose-fitting  i would like it more a little more fitted  jsut a bit.
This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!
I love this dress in the photos  and like it enough to keep it--but i don't love it. it runs borderline true-to-size/slightly large. i'm 5'8"  133 lbs  34 b and usually wear a 6 in dresses. i ordered a sm and med. am keeping the sm. medium was way too big. my main issue is the amount of fabric in the skirt--it's a bit full. in the pics  this dress appears straight  but it's not. the higher waist and skirt's fullness gives it a more casual  youthful look  which is not what i want. but the quality
I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall  the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.
I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.
It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
This is my new favorite shirt. i'm actually wearing it today! i had to order another in white too. grab it while you can!
I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.
This shirt is comfy  fits well  the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits  but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show  but it isn't and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise  i like it  but i wouldn't have bought it unless it was on discount  which it was.
I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan
I ordered 5 pair of these pants and the dye ran everywhere when i washed them according to instructions and then it came out with weird lines and splotches in the pants. i sent them back and retailer was very nice about replacing them. i have yet to wash my 2nd pair but we will see.
I love this dress  it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time. i try to not buy dry clean only pieces  but i had to make an exception here!! perfect for early spring days.
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
I agree with previous review...looks so much better in person than online! i really do not need another poncho style sweater  but i could not resist. they colors and style are great!
I was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted. unfortunately  they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo. also  they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly  which was surprising since i don't have a small behind. unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out. had to send them back.
Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.
Super cute and comfy. bottom of the legs have about a 8in slit that is not shown in pictures. also the hem came unraveled after the first wear. worth the money on sale! received many compliments. not see through!
The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
Very comfortable. fits true to size. i also have this in white. fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable. shirt is very flattering. the polka dots add a playful touch. super cute.
Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.
These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!     for reference ( if you decide to try your luck)  i am 5'7"  128# and my normal size s was perfect.
Cute in concept  so large in reality. i am 5'3"  size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. don't even try if you are a little person. long and lean  yes  would probably look great on you.
I loved this at first sight  and ordered it in a 10  12  and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra  so usually braless is not an option  but this actually offers enough support. and  if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it.     it's super flattering  and really fun to wear out day or night.
This dress is very feminine and flattering on  especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). when it's very fitted on top  i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2"). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman  but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is
I ordered this for my friend and she loved it!
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.
While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
I'm always looking for easy casual items that will withstand being washed a million times  and i think this one will fall into that category. it's a nice thick knit - durable yet soft and sooo cozy. length is fantastic for leggings. i'll basically live in this on weekends!
This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person.
I get the great reviews. these do for me what no jogger could. i have hips. i never thought these would work. they do and they look just as cool on me as the model. i am a 10-12. i could only find a 12 but i think a 10 would be perfect. they are effortlessly cool and casual...for all body types. i'm so excited i tried these on.
I love  love  love these jeans! they fit like a dream and the fabric is so soft and giving. the waist comes up higher and stays snug  which means no muffin top. plus they look awesome! i truly hope paige comes out with more like this!!
Unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my
I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft  but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top  but otherwise a winner all around.
This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5"1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!
This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears  several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews  i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite 4 and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27" waist  35" hips and i'm 5'4" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats  i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not
I don't have anything but raves here.  this is a perfectly proportioned jumpsuit of high quality fabric in a neutral color (which is like a denim looking blue color with a beige starburst pattern  much  much nicer in person than in the product photo and has a really neat slightly nubby texture that adds interest).  it's easy to get in and out of.  the back of the waistband is elastic and stretches  so the only thing you have to do is tie the back  which is really easy.  the top (as someone menti
I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi
I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14  and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!
Gorgeous dress  but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.
I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however  when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror  i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning  they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3"# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh!     i thought perhaps it was my perception that day  so i waited an
The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.
Too much fabric  not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
It broke my heart to have to return this dress -- the fabric is simply gorgeous  very high quality  and i love the contrast between the yoke and the rest of the dress. but it was simply not flattering on me. i am 5-4 with a relatively large bust and an overall medium build. the small size fit me perfectly  but the cut just didn't look good on me. i have other tunic dresses that look great on me with tights and boots. so i am not entirely sure why this dress just didn't work for me. it may be tha
The denim is soft and very comfortable  the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans  and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.
I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect  but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.
I like these jeans. when i wore them  i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size  but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on  but as you wear them  they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile  my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi
I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy  but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments  i can't see anything. in fact  that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required  so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds  5'4"  34b  28 waist  40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it  but the salesperson suggested i try
I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't
I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this  i would say size down two sizes.
This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
Great fit  easy to dress up or down  lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer.
I bought this dress to wear at a wedding. i am short  so i would have really loved the petite  but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it. i'm making do with high heels. the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all. i'd also add that i'm pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly.
I'm barely 5'4" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length  the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size  always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an
Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.
I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.
This top is cute love the ruffle sleeves. the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute. does run a little large i ended up going a size down.
I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine  one arm is a darker blue tie-dye  the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much  so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey  but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday  put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans  out to dinner we went!
I bought a petite medium and the length was right  but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable  and didn't look completely terrible from the front  but from the side  it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing  but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup  smallish in other proportions (125  5'6") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?
Pretty tee  but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful  but fit is blah.
Cloth and stone never lets me down! awesome quality  comfort  and versatility. i imagine myself living in this dress this summer! soft fabric  easy breezy fit  pockets  machine washable...what's not to love? go buy it!
A fun dress to just throw on go  nice details in the bodice  mix of blues in the prints  little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind
My only complaint is that there is no lining. it also came very wrinkly and i need to figure out how to steam it.    however the fit is perfect (tts) and it is so very flattering!
The only negative about this dress was the placement of the stripe across your stomach
At the altar of bailey 44!  all hail the 'gathered stripes dress' because it can do nothing wrong  especially to my body.  i got the mp and this piece totally enhances what little i've got.  so happy!
I love this poncho! it is flattering (who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho?) and offers enough room for warm clothes underneath.  it is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated  and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath.
I so wanted this skirt to work  love the design! but  it's way  way too long... i am 5  5  116lb  and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model  and i'm pretty small on top.  overall  nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site
The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.
I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though  very soft  lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either  which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too  and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine  while not being overly "precious". it does run small by a whole size  which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.
The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.
This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely  but it was too short for me (5'7") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly  too  the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it  which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you  great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter
Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.
The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.
Lightweight  soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin  light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it  but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again  i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i
As with most retailer tops  this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice  pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
I absolutely love this dress! when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty. the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down  it still looks great. i think i'm going to be wearing this dress all summer. love  love  love.     i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself  and when i was walking it rode up (it's like a stretchy mesh type material). but i'm carrying a few more pounds than i'd like right now. once i lo
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame  and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the
This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops  but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere  but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area  so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton  so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath  and i can't see m
I had this on my wish list but saw it as a " on of" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale)  my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas
I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
A great everyday tee!! dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace!! looks nice with jeans and brown boots!!
Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy  i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.
Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere
I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk  but this sweater creates a long  lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans  and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this  i get compliments on it.
I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .     one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you  these are not the pants
I really wanted to like these. they're soft  long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(
I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on  and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots  the dress looked terrific! it's great  can obviously be dressed up or down  a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!
I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch  the fabric is very nice  i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!
This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well  it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top  it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous  and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.
Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!
Like previous reviewers have said  these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference  i'm 5'7"  130 lbs  34-27-37  and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants  but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6  i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares  so if you're thinking of ge
The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique  a "mossy" fuzzy print  and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but  if you do not wear a turtleneck under it  you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!
I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however  like the other reviewer  when i tried it on  the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
On the hanger  this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me  not quite.     the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle ... and the shorter length accentuated my big calves.     for reference  i tried a 00p and i'm 5'1"  102#  and 34a.
I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
This skirt is so beautiful!! it's a bit small  but only a tad. i can still wear it  and it encourages me to lose 5lbs haha! i get compliments everywhere i go.
As other reviewers have noted  the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans  but otherwise is unflattering.  also  the color is described as black  but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult  but if able to  i would have returned it.
Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium  the torso length is a bit short  making the garment pull. i sized up to a large  and with room in the hips and the correct torso length  the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference  i am 5'7"  36a  155lb.
I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all  the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dcolletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me
Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time)  i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and wouldn't arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.
Based on the photos  i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline  fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering  but the fabric is thin and clingy  making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was
Everyone should have this blouse  amazing! simply love it! it does run large  so purchase down 1-2 sizes.
This top fit nicely and was tts  but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.
I don't typically write bad reviews  but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me  and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small
I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover  the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself  the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.
Normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it. secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra  too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle
I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10" and 145 pounds  and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures  at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh  as shown  and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though  i decided to return the dress  because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati
Great fit and dark color; thick yet very soft denim. only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front (i was expecting it to be on the sides)  but i love them anyway!
Unfortunately  this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also  the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color  perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.  fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in
When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal. however  that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas  not very flattering  so back it goes.
I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes  because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a
Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees  it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"  135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.
One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide.
I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!
Absolutely love this top. it can be worn with jeans or a nice pair of pants. material is so soft.. love the length   little longer in the back. definitely would buy in another color
The look is frest  crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!
Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?
This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the "back view" picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model's black underwear.
Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.
Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than "blue" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust  blue  goldenrod  green throughout. super soft  stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33" bust  long torso  broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.
I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.
Tried this is my normal 4  and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay  especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice  length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else.
Overall  a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust  to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy  so i'd stay away if you are petite  with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.
It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1". don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price.
I bought this dress in an xs  and am 5'4"  115 lbs  and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug  but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.
I agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading! you can't possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured! it does however provide a great fit  i sized down from large to medium...and the brown color is really pretty!
I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect  falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly  which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip  to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra
This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me  but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.
I only tried on the ivory one  but it was so see-through  there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size  maybe a little large  but that's the style. very cute design  loved the back. too bad.
It's not totally apparent in all of the photos  but this dress does have a very noticeable a-symmetric hemline. i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is "forgiving" and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame. if you are truly an hourglass (small waist  larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight ) this dress is a poor choice. the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip  and the a-symmetry of this particular hemline not only draws
This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season 
I wasn't sure i'd like the sleeves but they are very cute and just the right length. i really like how the top fits and is very flattering
So comfy  great quality  not see thru at all  has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway  dont need a bra.
I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.   as for sizing  i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine  although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue
This is a gorgeous print  but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds  but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.
The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.
I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it "work"  lastly the
I like this blouse very much but my work is extremely conservative so i chose to return it. it really pops  even though it is just black and white. it has some sparkles in it.
This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me  i am 5"3' and about 120 lbs  the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low
I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online  but when i received mine  they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange  then more orange!!! i like orange  but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not  mostly orange on both front legs  the back of the legs have more color blocking  but barely any of the light lavender color
Beautiful sweater  unique knit mix and i love the color  but the fabric is too itchy. i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms  bum and thighs.  colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots (upper back/arms).  i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts.
I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away  otherwise i wasted $100.
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.
This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy  soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $
I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut  but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.
This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations!   i'm 5'2"  140 lbs with an athletic build  and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium.     the material is thick  high quality  and the colors are exactly the way they appear online.   the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc
I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it  i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however  the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.
Great fit  very soft fabric  and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
I thought these were pretty on the website  but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds  pinks  greens  blues  yellow -- with flora  fauna  houses  writing  type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft  medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets  though!
I really love these jeans! this is my second pair of ags and they're so comfortable. i will say that these jeans are super long! i have long legs and it takes a 3 inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly. if you're short  you can expect to get them hemmed. the high waist is great! size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently!
Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.
I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered  this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again  this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however  i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much  but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.
I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch  nice styling details  great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!
I purchased this top in the store  intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy  and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front  it looks pretty traditional  but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large  though  as i purchased an xs and still h
First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a
The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it  the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of
Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath
It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7" and 145lbs with 36" 30" 40" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful
I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.
I was very happy to see these longer length shorts (i have 2 pair of the shorter ones and loved them last summer) so i ordered them immediately. i am curvy and wear a 29 in pilcro and ordered the navy  which is a lovely color and will go with everything. i think they fit great and i like the fact that they are a looser style. i will buy more when they go on sale.
I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that  it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo  it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape  very flattering. however  the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...
This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall  one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring  and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great  but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person  the violet
I'm 5'-4"  130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also  the straight across  rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown  not a hundred dollar dress.
After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second  the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo  and the fabric felt cheap. finally  it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5" and the size 4 fit in the waist  but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on  they're also very poofy right below the waist.
I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime  but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord
This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.
This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions  depending on what you pair it with  which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
I like the colors  material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6" size 8.
I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.
I purchased this dress in 4 colors...beautiful and so comfortable. highly recommend
This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.
I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.
Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
These are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot. however  my normal 25 was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house  they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every 2 seconds. i ordered the black  mostly because i wasn't crazy about any of the other colors. if there were any colors left in a 24 that i could see myself wearing  i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me. i think if they fit you well a
Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns  the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed.
This is soo cute and definitely runs tts. i ordered both the 6 and the 8 and ended up keeping the 8. i absolutley love this and i think it is unique and fun! i plan to wear it on a vacation in a month.
I wanted this top since the first time i saw it. it fits perfectly in a small  as i usually wear a small or medium. it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top -i am a 36a- as it is not generously sized. it flares at the bottom  which looks quite flattering. the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style. i will wash it carefully  as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing. this is a beautiful top  and i am considering buying another in a different color. i think
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point 
I like the idea of the dress  just not the fit in the bust. i'm not particularly big (32c)  but it just didn't fit up there. i wish the dress had built in support because you can't really wear a bra.
Fun pattern  great colors and super comfy and versatile! great pickup at the sale price!
I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.
Wanted to love this dress  bit it wasn't to be. strange fit  and doesn't drape nicely  as in the photo. also  the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.
I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately  i was very disappointed when i received it. it is  as a previous person said  very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy  and in my opinion  did not flatter my shape at all. sadly  i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic  or straight and slender  as you suggest.
I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it "runs small" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!
This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly  i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!
Love these pants! super comfortable  but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.
So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house  so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews  it runs big in some areas  something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also  the "raspberry" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry  i think of pink or red  this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we
Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see)  and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack
This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.
Love this tee! lightweight  airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!
I loved the look of this sweater on-line  but it just didn't work for me. the fit wasn't good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel  scratchy. overall  it did not work for my body.
When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself "hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo." flash forward to me trying it on in my home - "yep  that's some side boob." it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning.
The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4"  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.
Great pair of work slacks with a flare. wear these with boots give a very rich look. super flattering cut and flat waist. highly recommend these for fall through winter!
Great shirt!! i bought the red penguins and its adorable. i am returning it however b/c the size i bought was too big  with that said it was my error not the brand. i think it runs true to size.
I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute  flattering  so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced
I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large  and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package  i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on  and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model  it will work for you. it is made of cupro  looks exactly like the photo  the color is g
Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely  hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short  i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.
True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading  looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue "jeans"; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.
The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice  color pretty  not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....
I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.
It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
This is really a cute top  nice fabric  the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8"  36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking  especially in the front. it hit at hip level  as in photo  but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t
I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you don't feel like wearing just jeans yet you don't want to be overdressed. the dress is 100% cotton and is extremely comfortable. i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace. the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms. extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue. a dress for all seasons!!!!
I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident  oops  meant to be? the color is very nice  not too bright holiday red  but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p  length was not too high/cropped  perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater  so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me  the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs  30dd 
I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.
I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it  tried it on  sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first  it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"  140 lbs.). the size was good  but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally  and most importantly  it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
Love this timeless piece  but it was a bit looser fitting than i expected. i consistently wear xs  so i had an idea of how i thought it would fit. i still kept it though  because you can dress it up or down and it will never go out of style!
Conceptually  this top is great. love the design and the bright crisp color and most of all the cut outs. the material is a little stiff but can see it softening up a bit with a wash or two. it does run very small. i am 145 pounds  5'6: with a full 34c bust and a curvy hourglass figure 34  28  41. while it fits everywhere else  the bust is really small. i wear a size 6 but had to go up to a size 10. the size 8 fit but the chest would only close without a bra. so  i had to go up 2 sizes.. so when
In the words of my husband  "looks like you're wearing a bag." i'm althetic and short. maybe this works best on tall and very slim?
I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover  if you are short  the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips  this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"  160lbs and usually wear a s/m.
It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible 
Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6" and a classic size 8 and this
I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
Regretfully  this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size  i ordered it in both colors  however  the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress  and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again  the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching  pulls   or tears for an exchange  but i can't pay 130" for a dress that is already torn.
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!
This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6". i'm 5'9" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it.
Material is thin  with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward  shows way too much  would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.
I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model  but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs  and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead  it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t
This top is beautifully made and designed. material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out. i just found it not very flattering for me.
Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4"
Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!
The top is gorge  it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great  especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag  do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.
When i unwrapped this a chemical "stink" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo
This top feels great on. it just drapes well and isn't clingy. i refused to buy maternity tops  because i wanted to wear the tops after pregnancy. though i bought this top post pregnancy it would have worked great because of the length.
This dress is shorter than it looks on the model. i'm 5'8" and it hits about 1 inch above my knee. it also runs a little big in my opinion.
It is a cute top and i loved the fit and it's super soft feel  but i'm kind of getting tired of the sheer shirt thing this year. i bought this for the summer and it's hot here so not wanting to have to wear a shirt under my shirt. it's not crazy sheer  but still undecided. if you live in a state with no sweat  you'll probably be fine. :) i'll have to walk around and try it in different lighting situations and think about it?
The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
High quality top  but material is not very soft-- may soften in the wash. fit is okay.
This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large  but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.
I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just
I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy  but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans  flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath.
I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.
Very pretty top  comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!
I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews  nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern  burgundy wine faux fur collar  the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did  this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!
This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide
I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms  i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me  this was a no go :(
I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though  but you will need a cami with it.
Very comfortable and flattering top  but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through  however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.
I bought this to wear to my winter bridal shower. it was a cold day so i turned it into a jumper by pairing it with a silk blouse. it is flattering and comfortable. great for work and other semi-formal events.
I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.
This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic  with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day  especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin  i would recommend it for style and fit.
What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 34 c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short  as i am long waisted  but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out.
I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo
I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14  i am 5' 6". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size.
Tried this on in the store  very soft and hangs well  better on  than the hanger. needless to say i bought it!
Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model  not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue  but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath  but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall  i'm very happy with this  though i'm also very very happy i got thi
I love the fabric and details of this dress!! i was thrilled to see it in person. i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress. i am choosing to keep the hem where it is  and thus prefer it as a "colder months" dress. the poppy flowers really "pop" in this dress- love!!
After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it  which is awesome  and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also  the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.
Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference  i'm 5'4  124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing  i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small  but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely  but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig
The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous  but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small  which is unreal  since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite  height-wise  but more than length  there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely  though  so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny   high waisted version. first  i don't like the faux whiskering on the jeans  i think it makes them look cheap. second  the fabric had more stretch than i'm use to for pilcro denim  and made them feel low quality.  i don't think they are terrible  i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt. buy it! you'll look super classy and put together. i wear to work and going out. i've been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because it's so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt.     note i'm on the short side so the "blazer" ends up being a little longer for me. i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight (jersey/terry on the
What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem  it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.
So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice  very wide  comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length  i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these.
I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight. the fabric  however  couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.     such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large  but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i
I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants     i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful  feminine summer top.    i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.    requires ironing.    i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small.
I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic  but in person  it really caught my eye.
This is a pretty tunic/dress that looks and fits exactly as shown. i imagine that it would be quite long on anyone under 5'5" or so  since it falls maybe 2 inches above the knee on me at 5'7". it's cute  and an easy throw on and go piece. the quality is even good. i decided to return it though because it felt a little plain for the price...maybe if it were more exciting colors or patterns? a slightly more fitted cut? i couldn't place my finger on the exact thing that wasn't clicking for me  but
This is a flattering  comfortable  soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that  however  i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy  and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
This sweater is gorgeous. it is soft and i love the button detail down the sides of the sleeves. i would have loved the blue color but it was sold out  so i settled for the soft peach color. it is a very pretty sweater and looks nice on.
I liked this bc it is long  ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.
Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb  34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect  the top is huge  especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however  the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.
Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!
Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen)  but i still think it'll go with a lot.
This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress  even with the slip  which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip  wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
So great! soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body.
Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4  weigh around 120 lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
Love the simple  casual elegance of this coat. i especially love the colors  grey & beige  because it looks great with my grey jeans as well as my dressier beige pants. i will get a lot of use from this coat.
I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.
This is an adorable little top. the tank has such beautiful detailing on the chest. the flowers are more red than pink. i found it to be tts on me.. the tank is flowy and loose.
This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric   but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.
I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.
I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front  but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame.
This sweater is pretty  fits tts  feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures  i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think
To sum up my review at the beginning: i walked out to my best friend and two retailer employees and all 3 of them stopped and said  "whoa." it's an understated stunner. i tried this dress on a whim: and boy am i glad i did. i'm 5'4"  140lb  34b with weight carried on the bottom  usually wear a size 4 in fit and flare dresses: the size 2 fit like a glove here. i'm shocked at just how incredible the lace is: thick  well laid on the base dress fabric  gorgeous without being too 'lacy'. the base fabri
Bought this for the beautiful fabric and easy fit which it has. fits nicely through the shoulder area and is a little on the baggy side in the legs but the draping fabric makes up for that. i bought it in petite small and it is definitely long enough for a dress.
This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.
This item is huge. i'm normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent.
This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.
I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in  it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned  so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un
If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit  if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't
This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however  the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.
Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel  they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.
I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation  but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that  like many byron lars sheath dresses  the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t
The pants are everything i expected and much more! the material is a delicious and light weight. the colors are beautiful-white base with jade green and black design. there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie. i am 5'9" and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground. i weigh 140 and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit. i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfy-these are a win-win!
Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy  as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts  so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.
I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore  so i bought 27r  knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better  and it fits a tad loose ev
These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13".
These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see  but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top  and i'm good to go!
I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
Deletta has done it again  designed a top that is unique  flattering  and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of
The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliqud patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.
I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
If you know the meghan trainor song (and who doesn't?)  you'll know what i mean! i could tell by the photos online that this skirt would enhance curves  and i am fine with that. however  it is very snug in the rear. i can honestly say i had made it to my 40s without ever once wondering or worrying  "does my butt look big in this?"--that is  until i tried on this skirt. however  i chose to keep it since we were going to hawaii soon  and i decided it would be fine as a casual skirt and cover-up. i
As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
Pretty tank  embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price  should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.
Like the first reviewer  i love the color and look  and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo. i am 5'3" 116lb and ordered a small. i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done  but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything. and the metallic threads are itchy  so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st
This dress is comfortable as well as flattering  which does not happen very often! looks good with navy tights too!
I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it  they just fixed the problem. thank you!
I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.  as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material  which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line  which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not
This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy  soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.
I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
I normally wear a 4 or 6 at retailer and bought this in a 6. the size 6 is even a tad small in the bust area but not small enough to size to an 8. i am 32d for reference. for ladies larger than a c cup  i would recommend sizing to your larger size. definitely try on at the store if you can.
This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length  which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off  so i didn't buy it.
I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium  so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer  as a handful of retailer designers seem to do  simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup  as a medium i was a b cup. now  years later  as a size 16 i am a d cup
Love this skirt  beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so
Great quality  flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.
Good quality tank. very flowy and longer if you are short.
This tunic is a nice basic to have. it is like a light sweater knit. the arm holes are a little large and hang low but can easily be remedied by wearing a camisole underneath. nice with leggings or skinny jeans.
Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!
I wanted to love this dress  the open back  the lightweight fabric  and fun print. perfect for spring and summer. it could be i'm too tiny for this dress  but the front of the dress wasn't flattering. it just hung and there was an odd tuck in the waist that made it look like it ballooned out under my chest above my waist.
I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail  i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape  material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.
This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple  black  stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.
I picked up this t-shirt at my local retailer today  immediately drawn to the super cute  colorful graphics  and the unique stitching at the collar  saying "giddy up!" to go with the cowboys  horses  cacti  and movie camera  (unusually!). the graphics are way cuter in person  as compared to the weirdly wavy-distorted and unclear photos shown online. if all i had seen was these photos  i would never have even noticed or recognized the design. go to your local store to see this in person  and you wi
I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a "wow" look. i'm 5'1" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine.
The top fits nice  but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.
I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope.
Love it! easy to wear  true to size. there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy
This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size  i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.
This sweater is beautiful and stylish  but unfortunately it sheds a bit. considering the sale price  it's still worth it so i won't return it.
I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt  there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable  and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul
Other than the color (i got the rose color)  which is great  i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7" and the sleeves come right to my wrists  if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.
Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again  a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.
Love the top  it fits wonderfully  and it's lightweight. my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things. other than that  it's a great spring top.
I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online. i couldn't be happier with it. it is very comfortable  flattering and unique. i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies.
I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.
On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.
Cute top. definitely sheer so need an undershirt. really love details on it  especially back and fringe at bottom. 5'4  135 lbs  ordered s.
Lovey top in the photos. however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3  118lbs  36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.
Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material  fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller  thinner bods.
This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however  on the third wear  the side zipper split wide open. needless to say  it was returned.
This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  "i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful
Really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material  i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.
The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears  which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume  the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless  though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid
This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.
Got this in white and love the scallop detail. the material is also super soft and stretchy. i would've absolutely loved this in black  but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much. i think this would be super cute on a taller frame. got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit!
I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.
I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.
I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy  but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.
I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
Super cute! no complaints! fun print! light weight soft material!
It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size  i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.
While i loved the material  color and concept of the dress  it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2" and 108 lbs  pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right  it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly  this will be going back.
This blouse runs large  billows out slightly  and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty  the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless  i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.
I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price  i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade  but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
I read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase. i am so pleased that i did. the m fit nicely. the fabric is not as soft as i had wished. however  i think with wear it will become broken in.
I loved the look of this shirt  but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.
This blouse is stunning. it's ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it. i am 5'3" and 108 pounds. i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms. my bust size is 32c. i ordered the xxs in both sizes (not petite  as i have a longer torso) and they fit perfectly! they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better - obviously - because it fits better. the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b
The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a "pooch"  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung
Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual.
I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot)  and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it  it met all my criteria  and as an added bonus  my husband said  "wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said  this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy  flattering (in all the right pla
I love this skirt... i have it in black  and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue  so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you...
I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
I have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find. they feel great  fit well  the price was good even before i got them on sale  i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of. wish they came in more colors..
I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.
I'm 5'8  130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric  pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.
Love this swing dress. i purchased it for work. it is light and comfy. i wear it with tights and boots. i even purchased it in another color.
Soft! sleeve is cuffed! different. called moonscape. cool vibe. tiny threads on front of moon.
I love this top  wish they had it in more colors  i would buy more!
As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah  that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size  and again in a larger size. unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties.
I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger  it sort of looked like a tent on me  whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though  and it was folding down under the arms  making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center  as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we
This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.
These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute  i never want to take it off. :p
I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"  but it fe
Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however  that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it.
5'7"  135  34c  27-28 waist. love. a thin pullover (early fall weight) great for layering or on its on. darling with a skirt or jeans. buttons down the back for looks. bought the small. tts. fits like in the picture - hits at the hip. colors in photo are accurate. would be darling oversized too. it has just the right amount of fun without entering the stratosphere of crazy-cat-lady level. no bows on the back. i'd hand wash this one. if you still love bows  but don't want to be mistaken for being
I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened  i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece
This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress  which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.
Beautiful piece  very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big  i'd go a size smaller.
I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.
I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well  in my usual 4 petite  i think it would look nice on some people  as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.
Lovely summer top  comfortable and cool for hot summer days. beautiful fabric  fits tts. highly recommend.
I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom  presumably from the buttons. i was torn  but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
I'm a 5'7"and curvy  these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!
I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest  but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip  but ultimately decided to return it.
Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape  but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long  but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this
Classic retailer stunning dress! the embroidery is beautiful  with the beads and details. the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion  but i didn't have trouble with this. i got a ton of compliments. it looks a bit flat on top on the model. i'm not very curvy  and it accentuates my curves nicely. it doesn't hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture  but has a more classic fit and flare shape  very flattering.
I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh
Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky  but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic  soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy  i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck  and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.  fyi- large top fit perfectly  but i needed a medium bottom.
This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning
I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.
This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.
I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering
I bought this top in black  and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me  but this top is definitely a great length.
I don't usually go for the "tenty" cut in a blouse  but this one has such pretty detail and with a little cardy  looks great! love the black and white detail and embroidery.
This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
No  but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8  a size 6 on top  8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online  but i saw this on naomi's blog  love taza  and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer  and while they only had a m/l  since i'm tall  i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like  it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model  and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well  so just looks  huuuge. i thought i was bein
I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts  and it is very soft and comfortable. however  it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it  but i am doubtful. so b
I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27"  hips 32"  and i am 5'4". the material very nice  has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up.
I bought this dress online in the cream/black combo for an incredible deal. i wasn't thrilled about it when it arrived  even for the ridiculously low price  because the contrast between the top and bottom was too big. the two materials are quite different: the top fabric being much more casual than the bottom fabric  and with the color contrast it just looked like a top and skirt that you wouldn't put together if they were separates. when i went to my local store to return  they had the grey com
This is a very nice top  however  it was too large for me. i ordered a medium and needed a small. i am 5'9" 145 lbs.i will try again with a small.
1. i'm 5'5" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.  2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos  but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.  3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all.
This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions.
I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line  the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer  so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to
Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
Perfect dress for the fall in texas. the velvet is on point for this season. the dress is very roomy on the bottom half...wish it was a little more fitted. but  overall a great dress  got tons of compliments!
Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4  135lbs  size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type  i'm hourglass and athletic.
I love the weight of the material; sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap; this does not. the lace trim is more 2-tone than the photo suggests  but that is not negative  and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach  again  not a negative. the length is as it is on the model  just below the knee. i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach! i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops. i felt special  stylish and comfortable. it was a good dress for some
One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer! the color is a beautiful berry color! also love the length... it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love! 5'9
This dress is absolutely stunning. i did agree with other reviewers that the skirt is very full. i had it taken in  and it fits exactly like the model.
Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric  it's very scratchy.
Not sure who named this dress  but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric  with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes  leather flip flops  and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!
These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top  but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.
I absolutely love slips  and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans  i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses  and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough
I was excited to get this shirt in the mail  i liked the pattern a lot  but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"  130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric  the shirt pulled open in the chest area  making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric  especially since she's small on top. ther
I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.
First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
Love this shirt so much. it is comfortable and a beautiful print. i sized down because it is very flowy! it is ivory instead of white  but still looks beautiful. one of my favorite tops.
This is such a soft  comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!
I'm 5'5" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs  34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too  but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering.
As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.
This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence  take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!
On the hanger i thought this would be a great work dress  but on my curves it was pretty scandalous. really low cut--will need to pin it  and hugs curves (if you have them). it's comfortable and i like the pattern. i have a number of maeve's jersey dresses so i'm not expecting it to last incredibly long  but at 25% off it was a good deal.
You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.
I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim.
I received these pants  but they are not as pictured  see the photo of the back pockets  there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received. i'm not sure about these  the quality is nice  but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered 2 sizes down.
Nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available.
Love  love  love this piece! very flowy  but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!
Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.
This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se
This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt  but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring  this is it! i am 5'8" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch  making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.
I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2"  108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.
It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.
I agree a few others  it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact  that after the first size didn't fit  i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl  l  m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful  but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
This is a beautiful looking dress  but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4  112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked  even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress  and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized "boyfriend" feel to it  the rounded front hem  hip pockets  and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality  but it is perfect for my minneapol
The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however  the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.
I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately.       fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different  there was hardly any beading  and the colors were washed out and dull.     i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect  i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!
This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28  i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!
Another perfect maxi from retailer! the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my normal size in maxis (medium) and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight. i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i don't feel like i am showing too much cleavage. it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect.
Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!
I bought this top to wear this fall  and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder  making this great for work.
Yes  this is a bit expensive; however  it is made in the usa  so that is a very good thing. i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality  well-designed basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country. when you are considering this pretty top  please click on the gold so that you can see the detail. it is very well-made and flattering. i love how it has a slight shape at the back  very flattering and feminine. the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com
I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.
I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece  and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops  the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo  for instance. it is definitely not slimming  but the striking patt
I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...
The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.
As another review said  the model's pose doesn't do this dress justice and i can't believe this is on sale. i picked this up this weekend at my local store. it fits wonderfully  very flattering. the fabric feels good and i'm fairly certain won't wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip. dress it up with boots for dinner  dress it down with sandals for day. this is a steal  get it! (i'm 5'8"  ~145  the size 8 fit perfect)
I really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red  size
I like this sweater  but it was like others i owned so i returned it. it is good quality and fits well.
The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(
I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly  this is going back.
This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.
I ordered the black & white  00 petite. i'm 5' 2"  96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23" (on the back  from neckline) which is great for me; however  the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25"  so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00  regular length  but then the sleeves will b
Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.
This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).  so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v
I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.    ivory is actually truly longer than the black  i wasn't sure from the photos on line  but having tried both on  ivory is longer (as shown online).    true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big  but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs  30 dd chest  26.5 in waist t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne
Have worn this top multiple times with jeans. neckline makes even those of us who are small busted look great up top!
This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders  which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb)  i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.
The top is really cute  but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
I'm 5 feet tall  so dresses are hard to find for me. but  the petite sizes fit accurately. i'm very pleased with the dress!!!
I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.
Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos  there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that  it's a beautiful  unique summer top.
This is a great piece  which has flow  grace  and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time.
I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first  even after i bought it  but after wearing it  i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric  fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan  which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then
This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.
The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2"  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s
I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy  but flattering.  wearing it on my shoulders for work -
I initially saw this top a few months ago  and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores  so i ordered it online  where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week  and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty  but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good  but when they realized they were so popular  and had more made  the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery  and ther
This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however  at about the mid-belly range  the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price  i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.
This dress is so pretty  a true cinderella dress  that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics  but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14  which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand)  the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
These are so cute and the colors are great  however  they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once  they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at  least one size  i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik
This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy  but even so  i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.
This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design  it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.
This top is gorgeous and flattering for spring. the fit is beautiful. one thing - i find that the seam that goes across the stomach does chafe a little bit. however  with a light tank underneath this is no issue at all and the top is well worth it.
Picked this up on sale - was on the fence about the bright reddish/orange coloration  but it really says summer and goes so easily with multiple summer pieces. it is generously cut and made very well. i've worn it on cooler/rainy days and it really brightens everything up. best part is that it launders well too.
This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe
It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue
Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
I was so excited to try these  it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.
Feminine flow  however slightly large. such soft material. love the little details.
I bought this on sale. the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves. a little see through  but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath.
This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big  loose and had no shape at all.
I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.    the description does not say "lined " and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the "yellow with white piping" sweater coat. this is hard  coarse  itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back  and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only
Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great  comfortable  and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large  so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.
This lift weight cardigan is true to size  perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice  especially the little pops of orange.
Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.
Love this tunic  it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots
Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively  causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model  this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will
So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it  hoping that it'll fit me.     i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper.     i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress  i don't mind it.
I bought this tank for work  but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs  5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose  which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist  and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though  not to heavy and not too thin.
This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one  but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
This dress is very pretty in person  and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable  and the length is perfect. for reference  i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses  and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size  it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large  but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist  so i would say it fits true to size for me  but w
This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on  but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress  but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.
These are great pants  have them in the green holly color
This sweater has potential  but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick  and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high  so i need a longer look. the color is true to size  but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
Ugh  i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt  its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i
I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down  the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra
This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.
Ordered this in my typical size  xs  and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis  but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus  there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral  brown that should go with almost anything.
Material is very thin  and although this is apparent in the design  i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering  and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise)  i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo
While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.
I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut  however  it was way too short. i am 5'6" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it.
... for the model to look like this? pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip. cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin
I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here  but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.
Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.
This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however  i'm 5' 5" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing  but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad  i love the top 90% of it.
I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m  which is my normal size  and a s  which  if clothes are baggy  i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted  so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it  so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi
Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture
I read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable. i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist. the length hits me at the hip--i have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath.
Very cute top but it seems like it won't hold it's shape very long. cheaply constructed.
I already have some dresses similar to this  but i couldn't help getting this one  too. i love the flowers  bees  and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket  so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light  floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.
Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.
Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.
I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure  but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked "trim". my mom  friends  and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored.
Classic and beautiful style. structured material that will always fall just right. looks beautiful and will take you to any occasion - heels or flats  office or dinner party. definitely shows off your shoulders.
Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
I was hoping this top would be a nice architectural piece to add to my wardrobe with its straight black line accents. sadly  in the end  it is just a t-shirt. a large t-shirt. i ordered my normal size (medium) and this shirt ran more like a large. i also did not like the way the neck was hemmed. the fabric folds over itself  when i think a better design would have been a more simple hem. i ended up returning this item due to its size.
So much to love about this dress! the color is exactly as pictured in the video  not photos. the fabric is substantial  beautiful colors. the dress is well constructed   back zipper and is easy to put on and take off. it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner! it's not super puffy  just enough to give it some flare. i am 36b  5'8"  155 lbs and bought a 10. it fits me perfectly! the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet. oh  and i
This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it's a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i don't think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.
I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!
Runs a little large. i'm 5'9''  150 lbs and ordered the medium. probably could have gone with the small. still  it has a tie waste so it works! love the length and print. can't wait to wear it this fall with a jean jacket!
The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the "outside" middle material  hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.
The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return
This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me  but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.
I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!
These pants are more like 9" not 10". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.
This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
I usually wear a small  sometimes and extra small  so when i ordered this skirt in a small  i wasn't worried. when it arrived  there is no stretch whatsoever and i'd have to wear it really it high in order to zip it. not necessarily a bad look but it is a little uncomfortable (no give  stiff material). it is really pretty  bright color and the eyelets and slit are unique. might try the next size up.
Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve  so hopefully it holds up.
This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store.
Love the colors for fall  feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned  much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black  khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants.
I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable  allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!
This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
Love the color and style  but material snags easily
This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however  the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"  125#  34c)  but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally  the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l
Good quality dress  except the lining is very sheer and thin. the inner strap of the lining ripped when i tried it on  so be careful putting it on. once on  it fits true to size  the lining is nice to have  so i kept it even though the strap ripped. if you are on the fence between sizes i would recommend going smaller to avoid having this style of dress look maternity on you.
Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.
I really wanted to like this top  but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips  or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top  without feeling like you're in a "crop top"
I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall  but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print  and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans  i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer  which i like  so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a
I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long  but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted  but still flattering  which surprised me! for reference  i am 5'2  105#  and i got the size 24.
Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8"). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to
I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.
I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo
The cut is too long and shapeless. if it was cropped  i would have kept it. the beads are delicate as another reviewer has said but i was prepared for that. too bad the fit just wasn't flattering. it's going back.
First  let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1"  138lbs  34dd  30  38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve  esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6.     first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips.     the bad: surprisingly  the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f
The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.
Cute stripes and soft  but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out  people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
Pretty fabric  nice style  took it back.
I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size  not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!
So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money  but i needed something to wear that was transitional.
Nice  flowy  comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest  despite the top fitting loosely on me  so i have to wear a layer under it.
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes  but might make an exception for this one.
First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret
A great staple to pull out on chilly mornings. i am 5'9" so the arm length was perfect
This is a cute top  especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
I am keeping these because the style is just cute as a button! ;) the button details on the ankle are so adorable. i would normally wear a size small but like the other reviews said they run small - i purchased the ml and they fit great. i wore them all day to work and they are slightly itchy....and during the day they would fall down and i would have to keep pulling them up. reminded me of when i was a little girl and my mom made me wear tights. however....they are too cute to not have. i will
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!
I loved this dress so much i bought in the cream/pink as well as the blue/teal. it is so light and easy to throw on. the slits are higher on me (i am 5'2) but not in a risqu way. it's very flattering and gives it a little sassiness.    i wish they had even more colors to choose from. that is how obsessed i am with it!
I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.
I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me  they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.
It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart  debated  and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing  because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer  went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock
I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror  it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however  that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself  but at 48  i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!
This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual  its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little  more edge and character. fits true to size. i'm 5'5''  125 lbs and was happy with the small.
I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one  i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of "homespun" look  which wouldn't be a deal breaker  but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo
Thought i would love this product  but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.
New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist  with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm  great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love
I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it's going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it's high quality. just wish the fit was better.
I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool  gauzy woven fabric  super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through  the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up  so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top  so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p  but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i
Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly  but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up  i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said  they are really nice. sturdy  linen-like fabric  pretty color  well made. i hope they make someone very happy!
This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers  i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere  and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.
My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase
I purchased this shirt in black. luckily  it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.
I ordered this shirt  aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades  but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top  it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts  though  because it was the right fit  despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean  but it wasn't. it was nice and sof
I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight  easy  but adorable tee for summer!
Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt. i love it...got lots and lots of compliments. great quality
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!
Extremely cute sweater  but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.
Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews  but glad i purchased! pretty print  looks great with denim. very loose  flowy top. hangs a little short  but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.
These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.
I love this so so much. i'm 5'1" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch  height  and leg area. so excited to wear this!
I really like how this shirt flows and feels. the details are super cute (double buttons in front  pleats in back). great shirt to transition to fall.
The fabric  colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy! i am 5' 9" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!
There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste.
The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge  it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
Loved the look  quality was great  but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.
I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted  but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through.     fit is tts.
The reason for the title above is this skirt doesn't wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere  and i don't go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....  __________  pros:  - tts. i tried on a large (and i'm normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.  - flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.  - a good everyday skirt.  - not sheer at all. it is lined.  - when y
Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.
I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning
I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better
This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures  i had high hopes  but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say  it's going back!
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny  but this blouse is cut correctly for it's size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down.   .  the neckline is really beautiful and unique  and the shirt material is soft. the front is a very pale lavender  and the sleeves and back of the blouse are gray. there is a pale lavender lining fo
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!
I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.
Love love! i am thick in waist and have thinner thighs and legs and these fit beautifully !! size down one size. very comfy. no muffin top or tummy rolling over and nice boyfriend look without being too baggy. very cute. so happy i found these. worth trying on.
I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt  a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the
This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fianc was not a fan of the suit either. even
I am in love with this top. it is so feminine and cute. i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty!! i got the cream color. i wish there were more solid colors. i usually wear a medium  which is what i ordered  and i love how it fits. i like flowy tops so it is perfect. please make solid colors!!!
I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.
I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!
This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!
I am 5'8" 135 lbs  broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio. this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering. love love love  definitely happy with myself for the splurge. can't wait to wear it out!!!
I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard  and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit  the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose  and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it's act
This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8  i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit  not only that  the fabric is very soft and good quality  very interesting style of the jumpsuit  looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped  wide-l
I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant  but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless  top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
It's stunning in person. delicate beading detail on bodice isn't visible in the photo but really dresses it up. fits lovely but runs small. i am usually a 6 or 8  ordered the 8 and it just fits. fully lined. bought it to attend a wedding and i'm very pleased with it.
This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to
Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my 5'3" height. the description doesn't mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be 31 inches. the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy. great color and style. i may be 60 something but these jeans bring me back to my youth. love them.
This is a shift dress  which is a great dress for many people  in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that  i mean  a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes  good legs  a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however  when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves  you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck  just a bit lower than this  because it makes
I love these pants! beautiful quality material  soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design  and really fun! i am 5 foot 5  and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped  so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips  but they aren't .
Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.
Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short  just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned  front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..
I really loved the fabric of this dress  however  it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.
Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom  but this was too cute to pass up. fits great  extremely flattering to my athletic build  super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3" and did not have to hem it.
I tried this on in the store in a size 4  and it was too tight. i'd need a 6 or possibly a 8  if i wanted a little room. (the store didn't have either.) though it was too tight  it was very flattering and more comfortable than i assumed. the neckline is a little awkward. the front straps of my racerback bra peeked out the sides. this might not be an issue with a bigger size.
I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape  not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?
It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.
I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was "warm and cozy" and not itchy at all  but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair.
I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too
I'm in love ... with this super cute dress!!! the material feels so good on my skin and it has more 'body' than it appears on the pic ! i'm 5'2" 115 lbs - i bought the s petite and it's perfect for me - slightly loose - i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me! it my official spring dress !
I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
Lovely dress. i was a bit hesitant as a reviewer mentioned the fabric being irritable but luckily i had no issues. the regular is long and i have to wear it with my wedge  but i'm ok with that.
This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.
Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however  the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it's so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj's but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!
I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true  it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.
This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.
First  i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs (5' 4"  119 lbs) and the geometric pattern is adorable. i often have a fit problem with dresses (i think due to a long waist) where the fabric bunches up by my lower back. not so with this dress. it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isn't binding. for my age  however (mid-40s)  this dress is just a little too short for the office so i'm sending it back. also  i felt that
This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall  160lb  i usually wear size l 8/10  but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves  i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.
The cascadia cardigan is a flattering piece that is perfect for fall. arms are longer  which i appreciate being 5'8". the backside is on the shorter side. overall really love this piece.
Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise  my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red  and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!
Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors  toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.
I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.  it is a pretty heavy  nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9" frame.   but - it is not white  it is beige  and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back  even though it was a great buy on sale.
This dress has great details and fit well on my hourglass shape. it just felt too covered up at the arms/shoulders  though. if the sleeves had been shorter or it had been sleeveless i think it would have felt a little more modern. the waistband on the one i tried on was also twisted  so you might want to check that before you buy.     fit is tts. a little on the short side.
This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size  but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout  it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i'm 5'9" and the dress falls to my ankles  but that's ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th
I didn't hate it  but i don't love it. i purchased it in 2 colors b/c i thought i'd fall in love. it is just ok. maybe it's b/c i have a larger chest  but i felt like it was too small in the chest area and too loose elsewhere. not the maxi fit i normally go for. however  the material is great and it's a simple sunday dress to lounge around in and run errands comfortably.
This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out  black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!
The picture does not do it justice. this dress is beautiful on. it is fitted on the top and flares on the bottom. it is also a very soft denim. the person helping me at the store brought a sparkly belt that made it even more spectacular. truth is it looks great with or without the belt. it fits true to size (5'4"  135 lbs and 34c and my usual size 2 was great).
Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m  depending on the style  5'3" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason  on me  the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model  the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but  due to the color and p
Dress is very pretty  but very short  almost tunic length.
I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs  i'm 5'4 130lbs  34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.
The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
I love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon  unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also  the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.
I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are
I loved the dress  but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however  the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms  and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8"  128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially  women quite far along in their pregnancy.
This is one of those "very retailer" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is "folkloric"  but the country is not specific. although listed as a "tee"  the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos
I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room  the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well.     i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co
I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.
This top is so cute! love the stripes in the red print and the detailing of the buttons. however  it does run slightly big! i'm 5'8"  145 and got the medium. it's so low in the front that i do have to wear a cami underneath. i see why they designed it a little larger since it comes up on the sides and it's supposed to be more of a relaxed fit. i typically love when shirts are long since i'm a little taller and this one hits perfectly in the front. it does dip down in the back and covers my bum (
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
My firned tried this on and her first comment was "take it off  it is scratchy"  so i didn't bother trying it on. it is  however  beautiful  if you are not sensitive to scratchy material. fit was true to size.
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.
I was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
Love the versatility of this dress. looks better in person!
This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress  even though i sized down.
I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.
I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric  but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.  i'm sure this could have been cute  but who wants a top that looks lik
I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.
This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
I ordered the dusty pink color and love it. works well with many colors and tops. i am 5' 6" and 121 lbs. with an athletic lean body. i do have a butt however and a small waist. i vary between a 26 and 27. ordered both because i could see this was a very slim pant. i could barely get the 26 up over my hips. the 27 fits like a glove  with just the right amount of stretch. i can't see these pants bagging after wear  which is something we all hate. love these pants and i know i will wear them often
This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit  but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through  and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette
The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......
I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all  it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
This is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it. and you think  hmmm- this is really interesting. and then you try it on. and all the ladies in the dressing room say "whoa" yep  this is that dress. much more fitted and flattering on my 5'9" 150lb frame. it oddly kind of alludes to 70's caftans. very cool.
Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3" and got a size small  a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style  fits great
This dress is amazing. nice material  comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!
I am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.
I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.
I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th
I ordered a small  but it was way to big. it was very soft.
I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties!   here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button  however the button is very low. therefore  the sleeve rolls up not mid arm  but actually about three inches above my wrist! (it's still super cute  just nowhere near my elbow. just letting you know).  final detail that
...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print  colors  and design. however  i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it  the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.
This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!
I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events. i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look. i am only 5'4'' and it hit above my knees. it's a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear. love it!
I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.
Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.    the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th
Like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also  the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly  it's going back!
White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.
I was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter  but also fit my style. i will have to wear a camisole underneath  but i love the feel and the fit! i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough. the sleeves are an appropriate length.
I really wanted to love this  but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref  i'm 5'3" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area  but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back  but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look
I did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking  but otherwise really liked this top. i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference
The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.
1. this looks so cute on the model  doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute.  2. that said  keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like 7/8 sleeves.  3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l. the medium is really a size 10  which was too tight across the shoulders and
Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time.
This is a beautiful top  but it runs large.  i am exchanging for one size smaller.  it is worth the effort of exchanging!  well made  beautiful lace.
Exactly what i needed post pregnancy. this top is very comfortable with a drape that hides my tummy. the back hits that perfect spot where it looks great  but still hides a normal bra.
This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.
This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings  over-the-knee socks  and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except  it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li
I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax  shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
Got this dress in the mail today  and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said  the fabric is a soft  shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me  anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.
This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable  elegant and very chic.     i will make this my go-to dress from now on.
This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material  maybe washing them would help  but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
I absolutely love these pants. they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing! they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall. i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested. i originally purchased my normal size 27 but they were loose after wearing a little around the house. i decided to exchange them for a 26 and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect!
I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it's really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant  especially for linen  and the construction is very high-quality. since it's linen  it feels crisp and light  and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch  too  since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular  which i found slightly big i
I ordered this coat because  like others  i was taken by its feminine beauty! unfortunately  the coat showed up with the top button broken off (and missing) and another button hole torn open. i returned that coat right away  thinking that it'd been damaged somehow in shipping. however  i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button! when i tried on the coat  i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket. not the quality i expe
I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed  it's just a really thin material.
I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.
I love this top! the sizing was great  and i have already worn it so many times  and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!
I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight  it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body  which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y
The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a "swing" top. i am 5'9" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it  as shown  i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.
I purchased this top in the black color and absolutely love it! it is very fun and can be either dressed up or down. i would wear this to work as well as out and about around town. it is worn loose  so i ordered a size down. i cannot wait to wear it through spring and summer!
Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory  of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front  in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4" and it hits at hip length. it does not have
From the photos  i thought the design was embroidered. in reality  it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown  but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition  this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering  not too tight  but shows just enough of your curves  physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium
I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
I'm on the fence about this dress but overall i like it. the material  design and all is great! it's a light seersucker type fabric and short sleeves are perfect for summer. now the bad thing about this dress is partly the print combined with the swing/large cut. if you aren't too careful it can look like a housedress or hospital gown. i find i definitely need a belt to define my waist to avoid this.
This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.
Got this in medium (5'6'  36c  120 lbs.). many of retailer tops i'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white. not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through. i'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly. a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer. you can wear this dressed up with heels  stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals. looks great with rolled
I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined  so no need to wear a cami underneath.
Like these pants and they were on sale--does not get better!
Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!
Love these pants! the print is very different  a little quirky  but black and light golden brown mixed together so very versatile. i have very thin legs and these are actually tight on me so maybe too slim for some.good length. they actually hit right at the ankle.
I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!
Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.    the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess.     looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders  but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also  front b
I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice  the neck is cute  but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.
I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit  especially online!      this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.       the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.
This top was so beautiful  exactly like the image shows but the waist was so tight. it was uncomfortable enough that i am going to return it. sad because the top and arms fit great. i am an hourglass so my waist is very small compared to my top and bottom. oh well  next time!!
Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up  mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all  so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband  but i don't think that can be prevented.
Maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans  but even though they technically fit  i felt like they looked like "mom jeans" on me. i was fine with the high waist  which actually made them very comfortable  but the ankles were loose and long on me  where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length. the quality is good though--the fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ag's  and the color is a nice saturated black. i tried on a size 27  and i'm 5'4"  120 lbs.
It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.
I wanted to like this top so badly because it has so many interesting pieces to the blouse. ultimately i didn't keep this because of the bell sleeves  and the pattern going across the body just wasn't flattering on my full figure. i went down a size to help reduce the amount of fabric draping in the back  but it didn't make up for the pattern that i just didn't like. if you are interested in this blouse  i recommend it because it might work out for someone with a different figure than mine
I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.
Beautiful shirt but runs huge! usually between a large or xl and i sized down to a medium.   the fabric has a nice sheen and it's a flowy shirt but seriously size down.
I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size  i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy  at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops  the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.
The previous review was right: this jacket/coat feels and looks expensive. nice weight  very soft. pattern is better in person. i normally always wear a l and in this  i can't decide between the s or m.
This top is beautiful and fits true to size  4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white  lavendar  the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to
I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/12 or m/l. i tried the 12 but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.
Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color  the drape  the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!
I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress it really is so pretty but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly the cut is not right for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection
I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color  the fabric  and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.  now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i"m surprised a
This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.
I love these pants! best fitting pants i've ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don't stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn't plan well and stock enough. i bought the black  want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants  i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity.
The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are  so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.
I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
Wore it a couple of times  it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.
I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4" (~118#). i guess i just didn't "love" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca
The design of this dress is darling and so unique  and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3" and ordered the 2  and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that  but this one's going back. shame  too  because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut  but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high.
Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.  beware: pockets decorative only.  runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined.
I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
I've been shopping at retailer since 2007  and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.   1. it is long on her  not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance.  2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above.  3. in the picture  t
I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9  140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected  making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed  as the color and concept were great.
Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.
I ordered this suit online which is something i never do!! i am 5'6" 120# and ordered the 6. it fits perfectly! it covers up nicely. i am small chested (34a) and it has padded cups which enhances my chest. the ruching hides any tummy flaws. really a slimming suit and great quality.
This has a lot of extra fabric in the chest area. i was hoping i could button and close that in a way that didn't just have it jutting out. luckily  it's still flattering. definitely bulky. and in the black  it's picking up lots of dust and lint. still a great cut and look  so i'm happy with it overall.
I am 5'6" and wear a medium. i ordered an 8 and a 10 and am keeping the 10  which is a little large but  importantly  is a full 2 inches longer than the 8. this is important to me because several of my casual pants begin a couple of inches below the waist and  as noted by another reviewer  and as is evident on the model  the top hits just below the waist. also  it is cotton/linen and may shrink (since it is ivory  i assume it will see a few washings). i don't want to worry about the "gap"  but i
Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design  but when i received it  it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.
I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.
This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??
I absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online  but unfortunately  it just didn't fit right. the bust and bodice not designed for curves  and the dress just didn't fit correctly  i think it would work better on very slim figures.
I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect  a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo
This shirt is purportedly made of silk  but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.
This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy  the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0" and ordered a petite small. probably returning.
Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!
I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.
Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
I bought navy in my usual size s  and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens)  i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable  warm and stylish. great staple  well made and well priced.
I'm a rather small person--5'2"  about 100 lbs  32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place  i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs  planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee  but even as petite as i am  i coul
This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable  with gorgeous embroidered detailing  but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio  i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist  the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened.
Cut out design  no seems or hems.   very disappointed in retailer
I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n
When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very
This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.
Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket  not necessarily just an outwear piece
I am very frustrated. i ordered the pxs and pxxs back in may...at the time they were both on back order until early august. last week i received an email that the pxxs was no longer available. i emailed customer service and got the reply that the shipment of pxxs was damaged and so that's why they were no longer available. i did receive the pxs and while the length is good for me at 5'4" it is enormous through the entire body (shoulders down to the hemline!) i know the pxxs is the size i needed
I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not  but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric  the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.
I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.
I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized  so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust  which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that  especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit.     the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w
Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash  so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist  slim hips  flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.
This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish  but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online  and the fabric is so soft  it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely  and so it's flattering. overall  a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.
I love this top  it's not too fitted and falls in the right part of my waist giving me good movement. i wear it to work and everyone compliments how the back is longer the top doesn't ride up your back!
I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft  comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.
So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well  xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both.
I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.
Unfortunately this top is shirt-length  and i'm only 5'4". needs to be about 6" longer. made of sweatshirt material  which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.
I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l  this would have looked like a maternity top on me.
Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant  and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress  even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant  i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses  and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu
I recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big  lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body
This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.
I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back  in the main photo  to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!
The beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.
I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.  yes  it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway.   the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.  i am 5'4 size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.
I have not had any sort of shedding problem with this jacket. i have worn it open with black jeans and a long necklace  and buttoned with a scarf and jeans. it is really cute! i am 5'4" and 115 lbs  and i got the small. i wouldn't hesitate  especially since it is now on sale.
I want to love this shirt  i really do  but it's huge! the top is tent-like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly  it's a return.
The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned  sleeves are quite short  almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt  but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.
I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size. however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.
I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however  every time i put it on or took it off  i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.
I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and  imho  the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long  but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i
Shirt looks nice standing straight but did not work if i cross my arms.  i felt that i could have superman'd out if that.  i would have gone for a larger size of it was available  but sadly not.
I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion  they run big. i am usually a small (4-6)  31" waist  38" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend  but with a longer tank or shirt  they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far  wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea
I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.
These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.
There are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right now-this is not one of my favorites. while the color is amazing  the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way. the are very close together which is hard to button up. the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hour-glass shape. however  sizing down (which would also fix this problem) would cause the shoulder/arm area to be too tight.
This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not  so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts  especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute  ver
I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.
I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4" and 160 lbs and tried a small.
The shirt is beautiful but slightly long. it is see thru and you do need to wear a cami underneath.
These pants are so comfortable and fit exactly as i expected. i love the variety of fun colors (i went with the gold). they are cooler than jeans  but just as versatile. i am 5'10" and the length on me is the same as the model.
I was hoping to find a slimming and cozy sweater  unfortunately this one was baggy and material was really bulky. one of those occasions where i would have never purchased this in person but online you can't quite tell the style and fit. i returned this item.
I absolutely love this top! i own it in coral and white. it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable. i am so happy i bought this top!
Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are "curvy on the bottom" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are
With all the white dresses to choose from this year  this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable  the quality is good  especially in the edge detail  it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white)  and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"  125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)
Generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition  the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!
This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.
So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color  see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway  i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee
With my 5'9'  hourglass frame  wider hips and having a baby  i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however  with this  i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts: _________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfort. - pockets! always a plus in my book :) - will go with any top. - nice length. fit me as in the model. - very slimming. - you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi
I really lived the detail   fabric  and quality of this tank. however  the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing.
I've been eyeing this dress for some time and it finally went on sale so i decided to buy it. i bought a size small and while it fits through the shoulders (which is the place i need a little more room) the body of the dress needs to be less sack-like for lack of a better term. i thought it would hide flaws  but unfortunately  it makes me look bigger than i am. it kind of bags out even at the back where the fabric is gathered under the yoke. that being said  i don't really want to return it beca
These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect  quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.
This t-shirt is great! it fits really well and is very flattering. the colors are nice  including the t-shirt color itself. the fit is perfect  including the sleeves. and it's very comfortable. my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times.
Love this skirt! i enjoy being trendy  but i love the retro vibe. can be dressed up  or worn to work.
This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally  you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!
Love it but it shrank and that makes me so mad.
I'm 5'8  130 and the small fit very nice. i ordered on line and on one of the legs the elastic closure at the bottom snapped. got a new pair at the store. you can dress these up or down. they are fun.
I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!
Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
Purchased this top online  and when i received it was very pleased.  it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.  love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.  also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.  with various necklaces this top has limitless options!  the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.  would have liked it to have a green tones  however it is still a fantastic f
I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.
I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.
Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is  however  not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd  the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted  it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked  as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!
Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it  despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.
I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however  when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.  also  i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.
The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
Right out of the bag  this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top  though). the fabric was heavy and felt "damp" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.  and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the "v" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose  droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither "flat chested" nor "busty"
I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me  returned it.
Gorgeous material  great length for tall girls  warm without being too heavy  super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year  not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great
I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft  105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed  i really wanted this top to work.
This dress is beautiful  but not made for someone with a 36d. i ordered a 12 and i could get my chest in this dress. i really wish it fit. it's well made and very beautiful. belt does not come with the dress.
These pants looked worn  washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5 4" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.
I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly  anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you
I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute  but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer  but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.
I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring  or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side  it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad  but i will definitely have to
Comfortable but if you put in the dryer  even on low it will shrink a little so beware
I just love this. well made  nice fabric and looks just great over pants or jeans. im very pleased with this quirky piece and got it on sale too!
But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)  probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires "truth in sizing"
This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust  order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.
Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival  i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise  when the arms are extended  the sleeves do hav
This really is a lovely shirt . i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist. i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves. the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors. it is definitely a keeper.
Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.
I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)
The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable  i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.
I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny  thin  and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline
This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i haven't worn the navy yet  but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it isn't too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.
This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit  large if not). very cute too!
I had to order on line -- so popular that my store had sold out! i ordered the cranberry colored jacket and love the color. fortunately the salesperson talked me into a small as it runs fairly big (i'm usually a true medium). i can't wait for the weather to cool off so i can wear it!
I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material  to the design  and fit  i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique  and i love  love  love the pockets  which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering  as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.
The shirt is amazing in the photo..but when it arrived in the package to my house  it is sooooo dark that you can't see the patchwork. not happy. going to return it. it was a holiday gift.
I am 5'7  115 lbs  and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect  and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great  but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom  but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head  but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price.
I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.
The colors on this top are beautiful  even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work  back it goes.
I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly  i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help  but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the
After the second wash  the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up  wearing it  and washing it a third time  the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke  but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact  i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer  but i've already washed and worn it  so again...very disappointing. i would say
I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it  it looked exactly as it does in the picture online  however  the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms  which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt  but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.
This dress looked so cute on the model  but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style  rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4"  i wish this would have worked  but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style  this could be s
I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.
Love this sweater! you can wear it with just about everything. i have worn it with dresses  leggings and jeans. you can dress it up or down. wonderful quality for the price.
I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back "x" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an "x" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.
I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt  but it is very pretty with capris.
Did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded.
This shirt is enormous and  as the title of my review suggests  it looks like a men's button down. the fabric is quite sheer  but that's actually what i liked best about it. i just looked completely shapeless in this top & wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it. perhaps if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i might have liked it better - it didn't fit anything like the model photos suggest - it's huge. not "easy/slouchy".
Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.  oh well  it's going back!
I love ag jeans and these are fabulous! i can't say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time. i have several pair. i purchased the royal blue color in the store. they held their shape all day and were super comfy. i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time.
I really love this top. they show it's as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it's beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.
This dress is beautiful! it is a nice  heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.
Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it! had to send back!
I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly  it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much  and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way  the fabric is super soft (but not w
Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant. they are over & above in comfort. i wear a size 8; and they are right on in sizing. i want to comment on the color/print. to see the green  i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely. that being said  i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses. i walked through my closet with the pants in hand. they match with light grey  periwinkle blue  light sky blue  navy  white  your choice. i do prefer a so
Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red  and it's a beautiful  vibrant  festive color. i am small-busted  5'3" and 120 lbs  and i got the regular xs  which fit very well  fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite  but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee  and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an
This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l  so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge  i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large  and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is  it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge  hip-y  and bunchy. yuck.
Despite being a knit  this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
I love jumpsuits in general. however  it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay! i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review! the waistband hits perfectly on me. i am 5'7 and about 160 and i bought the large. super easy to throw on!
These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss. this one's a definite hit:) i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap (unique  bohemian  feminine  cozy)  the fabric (beautiful intricate weave  high quality knit  wearable virtually year-round thanks to air conditioning)  how stylish it is (fringe  very "in" kimono cocoon cardigan)  how much of my wardrobe it goes with (neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down  elegant or casual)  and the fact that it has
Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous  it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric  but that's what i was expecting  and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.
This dress is very forgiving on my post baby body. i'm glad i purchased the petite  it hits my ankle perfectly (i'm 5'5"). very versatile  i can see wearing this at work (with a blazer) or on a weekend.
Love the color  but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms  the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
Love love love this dress! the fit is amazing and is slimming. although the lace is delicate looking  it wears well.
It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short  i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.  fits true to size  soft fabric  very cute.
I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the "laid flat width" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the
These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short  to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale  i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me  but i rolled them  which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.
I love this peasant dress! i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy boots/frye jane boots  black tights and silver sparkly earrings -no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke. the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape  so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined  has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff  and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have
I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans  flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!
This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized  playful  chic  dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.
Love this brand and i keep coming back. i don't have the most tone tush  but maaji always gives a cute little lift. i order a size up (usually a small so i order a medium).
These were great pants that fit well  had good rise  perfect stretch for my curves  and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10"  165lbs  with a pear shape).     after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week  at most)  and following wash instructions perfectly  they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn  the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch  and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've
I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways  i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue  and their material is fabulous  but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted  but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style  as i'm short  with a short waist. this
I saw this online and didn't think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and it's so much better in person! it is incredibly soft and cozy! i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions (cream/forrest green.) i can see this being a great staple over the fall/winter with leggings  boots and a long pendant.
This is a beautiful shirt  however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds  but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame  because it really is lovely. i sent it back.
I was hoping to love this tunic  but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute  but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately  it has to go back.
A culotte and basketball short hybrid. these culottes are heaven....very comfortable. the are great on windy summer days or walking around the city (between the buildings are like wind tunnels). the waist does run alittle large...i have a 29-30in waist and the medium petite fit my lower waist  but is large on my natural waist...a small petite would be better  so size down one size on the waist. plus the waist band is stretchy  so there is a lot of forgiveness in sizing down. plus the petite's le
I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9"  32c and i wear 28 size pants  usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp
I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
When i tried this top on  i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea  wrong material and placement.
I kept coming back to look at this vest for the color and design and finally gave in. vest is my favorite when dress layer. i hesitate because no descriptions about the model height  the vest may look perfect on her and look like a maxi dress on my 5'4" body. it turned out just fine. the front is below my knees like the picture of the model. i love the beautiful red and the material that stretches just enough for my arms to move around . this is definitely a good buy.
Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.
The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc  nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix. it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base.
I tried this dress on in the store  prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer  it would look more proportionate. next  the tie is really difficult to place  but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily  i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined  what a bummer  at least the skirt could be lined. but  it does have pockets  that is sweet.
I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans  and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow
I purchased the grey in a medium  i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops  36 c.. i found it to fit quite well  but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me)  you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer  but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around  you could even see the width of th
I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.
I am 5' 7" with an athletic build (small chest  small waist  muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small  an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.
I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers  but this dress is incredibly long and large  especially compared to the picture. for reference  i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me  particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!
Very comfortable  feels like you're wearing pjs while being dressed up. fits true to size. very elegant dress  rich navy blue color. versatile  can wear with heels  boots  or flats.
Bought this dress to wear for my engagement brunch! it does run big  but it's a laid back dress to wear?i never had to adjust the dress of myself while wearing it.
This is a beautiful skirt  but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.
The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!
I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust  so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find  as i did  that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size  and were lots younger  it could have worked for a dress with tigh
I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.
I love the style and the flow of this shirt. definitely worth the purchase and very flattering!
This top is exactly what i was looking for. rich olive color and very versatile. great as a lightweight jacket  casual or dressed up button up. i purchased a medium and it fits great. 5'7"  broad shoulders  narrow waist  and full hips.
I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty
Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.
This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!
I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store  i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on  the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy  but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that  and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low  so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides   i wante
I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"  170# bra size 34f and 40-41" hips.
Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.
I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per
I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
I expected to love this  since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine  but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just "meh." it's going back  unfortunately.
This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on  it fit great on my arms  wasn't too tight on my neck  but once it went down over my chest (36c)  the dress never came back "in" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me  very disappointing! similar to a mumu.
First of all  the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad  but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.    at any rate  i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers  i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t
This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black. ---------- unless you are very small framed  i would recommend sizing up; or  if you typically wear a m or a l  go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips)  large biceps  and a 34b chest  and i went with the l because
This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.
Ok  so yes  it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little  especially if you work out  but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0  didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short  i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses  tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic  flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a
Nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
This top is so beautiful! whenever i wear it i get lots of compliments. i have washed it a few times on delicate and it still looks great. i do have to wear a cami under it  but the way the straps of the top are made  you cannot see see my bra or cami strap.
As you can see  there is an array of differing opinions on here  and i share sentiments on both:  _______  pros:  - the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.  - tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight  it'll probably fit you like on the model.   - good length  not too short or too long.  - the mock collar is ni
This sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......
This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).
I loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered. the length was good for me (only 5'4"). the elastic top fit well (32b) but then from there it was too much fabric. i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me...several inches on both sides big. i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf
So comfortable  great fit  dress it up with wedges  down with flats   extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6" and the length is just slightly cropped.
This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
Dress cut was great  but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age.
I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.
I wanted this top in a petite xs  but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2" with a 34b bust  and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model  the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model  too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.
It is very cute. i think actual one is much better than the picture.
This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.
I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate  it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t  and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.
I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight  but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long  but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it  which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.
I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well  today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft  light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a
Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
I love clothing that has little surprises  and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is
I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd  148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago  the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
These culottes run very large--more than 2 inches of gaping waist band in my usual size. i would have kept them if they had fit  although sitting in them on a hot day might cause major wrinkling
I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also  it is pretty lightweight  so it stays cool.
This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.
I'm a huge skort fan from way back  but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack  so when i saw this on line i was excited  and when i saw it in the store  my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish  functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft  so it hangs in a flattering manner  instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea
I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.
They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on
This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldn't be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise  i'm thrilled.
Nice fit and flare style  not clingy at all. i got the grey color  petite large  fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...
I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.  it runs a little big  so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side  but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.
This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.
The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit  just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch  which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric didn't make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt.
This dress is everything everyone said it was in the reviews. so cute and beautifully made. fully lined. i felt it ran a bit small as i had to return it for the next size up  more so in the bust area. but the fit and length was perfect in the size 6. 5"10  125lbs. i will say that all the raving reviews made me purchase the dress without hesitation and i'm sure glad i did!
This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!
Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it.     keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the
I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.
The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.
I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large  but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style  it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly  plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of "cozying up" in colder weather by wrappi
I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.
Skirt is made well and beautiful colors. runs a tad small. i am typically a 4/6 and i ordered the 8 (based on other reviews) and it fit well.
I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me
Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not  busy but just enough so  and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.
I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this "coat" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)
This lacey dress fits well and is very comfortable.
I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality  unique  and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!
While the styling is cute  the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!  really retailer? i know you can do better than that...
The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.
I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable  but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i'm not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
Love this top and wish they had more colors in xs  but the sale was too good so they were sold out. i'm 5'10" 140 lbs  an xs fits great. will go with jeans or leggings.
These pants are very cute for spring/summer  and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me  they have a subtle flare -- nothing major  but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me  but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs  5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav
I loved the lace detailing all over this dress and the fact it had pockets and was mostly cotton. it just looked so inviting  so i grabbed two sizes to try on (10 & 12) that 99% of the time fit me with retailer clothes. here are my thoughts: __________ pros: - lace detailing is lovely all over. - everything runs tts except at the bust (see below). - breathable fabric  comfortable. _________ cons: - i'm a 36c and could not button the top two buttons of this dress in a size 10 (i'm 5'9  hourglass  a
The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace  color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite  for reference  5'2"  24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.
I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely  well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this  then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore
Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall 
I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't  the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.
When you order online  you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers  i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral  cream  green  and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however  i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes  order down.
I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very  very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress  i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens  i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that  this dress is my fav
I've been searching for a pretty and unique "party top" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger
I'm anxious to wear this dress with boots. i love the colors and print. perfect for work and evenings out.
Great material  and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up  making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.
I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but  i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim  this may work well  but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de
I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit  which i would've been willing to work with  but... as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
Just received this dress in the mail and i'm in love.  it's beautiful and fits so well.  i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but i'm so happy that i did.  ??
Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build  i'm 5'11"  150  34c  and size 8 was great for top and bottom.
Was looking more for a tailored  blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p  ordered the 00  and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4''  110 lbs  32c for reference.
This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top  but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer  so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.
This tank top runs big. i?m usually a xs and i ordered the xs and pxs due to reviews and the pxs is still big. i kept the pxs because it?s very cute and i love the color (ordered the canton). i?ve been taping the tank to my bra so it does not slip too far down. however  not sure if i will order this again.
I ordered this online and really loved the picture. when i received the dress  it was lovely  but the color was more purplish-plum than red  and the fabric was super thick and a little too stiff. i was still hopeful  but when i tried it on  it wasn't flattering. the lines of the dress are very sculpted -- for example  the waist nips in  which would be good  but the place it nipped in was not at my waist (i am very short-waisted with longer legs and often have this problem with dresses). often wi
Love the style and fit  but it does stretch out during wear. by the end of the day  it feels big.
Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.
I was expecting a lot more  but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose  just too loose  as it runs very very large i returned it
This is a beautiful dress and it was hard to let it go but  unfortunately  because the fabric is a little stiff  it accentuated my curvy back side in a bad way. it will definitely look great on someone with a smaller bottom. i tried the xs and did not experience the issues that other reviewers mentioned  such as the large arm holes.
Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking  i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!
Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.
Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi
Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun  but not too much.
I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful  breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline  upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.
The jacket is cute  it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.
First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly  it has a really funky  cheap  unfinished  raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again  does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.
It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.
Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite "not keeping this." the side zipper- a complaint by many  really made it uncomfortable. also  the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah.
I ordered the romantic floral in s and xs to try on at home and just love the print! the fabric is so pretty and unique! others have mentioned how "thin" the fabric was but i thought it was pretty standard for a bikini/swimwear and had no complaints myself. there are removable cup liners so nothing can really show through the top. the sizing was tts and the xs fit me best. unfortunately this bikini will be returned because the fit is a little off. i love the thicker strap at the bottom of the ha
I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color  slightly heathered.    what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.    i wore the tank out and about  and it was comfy and pretty. later  though  my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough  it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time  i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit
Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small  like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up  fits perfectly!
This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.
Lovely embroidery with a classic look  great addition to your wardrobe.
So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face  but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre.     fit: 5'4"  140 pounds - i bought a six  but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric  the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee
I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came  i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
This was exactly as expected. i ordered my usual size medium. fit well. good quality fabric. it's one of my comfy weekend go to items.
This sweater coat caught my attention online  so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit  across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4" 125lbs. i went with the small  with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt  that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look  if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings  but also warm enough for colde
Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes  size down.
I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine  without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist  but it's still very flattering.
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.
I love these jeans  but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.
I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.
Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts  lovely color and a staple classic.
I'm in love with this dress! i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i haven't seen a body that it doesn't look good on. i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didn't at all. this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet  i highly recommend it!
I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying "maternity"and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut  but i lov
I was disappointed in this bordeaux top  a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium  my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also  the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra  the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.
These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown  and want to buy the rest of the colors available!
I bought the blue dress  though the "blue" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.    i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge)  but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.     i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual  which is what i wanted  but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.
I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4" in the length and 2" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on
I loved this coat in the picture  and couldn't wait to get it. sadly  it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
Love this - bought in camel and cream in xs. runs large. cute with jeans & thigh high boots  leather skirt and booties or just casual. so many compliments... great for wearing a sweater but showing off arms....
Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
I am 5'8 with curvy  muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.
Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful  it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
These jeans not only fit well  i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them "hi-rise"  but them seem more like a "mid-rise" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash.
This top is really cute  but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on
This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!
I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70  but i think if i saw it in person first  i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute  the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels  necklace  armful of bangles  you can probably distract from the fabric.     5'5"  120lb  purchased xs and it's a little big still.
This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted  almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly  not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.
Very cute  but i would not call it pink. it's more of a melon color.
Fabulous colors  great fabric  super comfy and extremely versatile. i love  love  love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"  the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide  but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown  i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a
I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
I am now on my third pair of these pilcro hyphen chinos...they fit my body type well  which is pear-shaped. they are super comfy  relaxed  and my go to pant. i love that they are a pop of color with what i am wearing vs just a normal jean. i can't say enough about these pants...
This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.
I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on  the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!
I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap
Oh boy...i didn't get this one  and it runs small. too bad.
The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage  which was a nice surprise  because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short  5'3".  neckline is fem
These are a nice option if you want crops that are shorter than the typical mid-calf length  but you don't want short-shorts. they hit right at the knee  so the length makes them cool and comfortable for summer. i wanted them to run errands  walk my dogs  and generally to just hang out. they'll be nice when traveling too.  they run large. i usually wear a 28 but bought the 27 in these. ( 5'5"  124 lb.) they also definitely stretch out while being worn  so you may be able to size down even furthe
The green color is beautiful. i love the cut and material - it feels luxurious. definitely needs ironing before wear but is a must have
Little clack dress. classic shape but is pretty low in the v neck. i am busty (34dd) and need a "push-up" bra to make the neckline close. it's very easy to wear and super comfy.
This is a very light  flowy dress. the lining is very fitted  but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow  but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured  not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.
I really wanted to love this  but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter  this would be a win. nice fabric  not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips.
I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice  sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender  the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note  this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri
I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.
This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag  with only a quick ironing. unfortunately  the first time i washed it (cold water  hang dry)  it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy  is much shorter  and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately  after i had purchased and washed!)  i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only  because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
If you are over 25  this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it.
Great material  pattern and cut. perfect summer top
Like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well  i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo  although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms)  and there's no "swing" to it. i am 5'4" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small  which is what
I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said "that's a piece of tablecloth." it's going back.
These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
So comfy. i'm 5'8" a-cup & it fits well. i bought a small. an acquaintance of mine has it & she's petite w boobs & it looks great on her too. she has black & i have lavender. great purchase!
This is a cute dress  not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material. little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie.
Loved the red and white stripes and soft fabric  lays nicely has a nice cut. pairs well with jeans and a cute casual jacket or dress it up. nice quality and color!
I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.   other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.
These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model.   they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.  especially for the high cost  there are much better althleisure leggings on the market.
I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme
This is a lovely sweater but i wished i had ordered the xs (only the small was left).
Runs small in the chest  so don't order if you are large chested! over all  very cute.
Based on the mixed reviews about fit  i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise  it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall
These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos  but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens  but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8" 138 lbs  and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs  and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all  but i only tried on the black/charcoal.
Gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry  it will). between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.
I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2  but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.
Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.
Very cute print but runs large. it is really long too.
For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier  more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
Alright ladies...this jacket!! its even better than it appears online. the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable. because of the stretch  i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl. but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater. it is gorgeous. it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm. the design has so much detail to it. there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want. this jacket will look amazing with a
This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good  the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo  the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be  which fall on the seam and when i tried this on  the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre
This is a comfortable sweater dress  and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size
Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s
I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however  the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.     sadly  dress had to be returned.
The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.
Love these! no bulging  substantive fabric  very flattering cut. i'm 5'7"  170 lbs  wearing a size 12. these were perfectly cut for me  no pulling  bulging  or weird gathering in awkward areas (we all know what that means).. these will be a true staple for me with a variety of high-heeled sandals  kitten heels  and gladiators - i can't wait to wear them.    my only concern is the fabric and it's ability to repel stains - sometimes the trade off for stretch is easy care. we'll see. i'm willing to
I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted  keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!
Love this sweater! it is so cozy! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot. i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding. i am hoping to buy other colors.
I adore this dress. i wanted/needed to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them. i'm 5'9 and ~128 pounds and ordered the x-small and it fits me perfectly. the color is so rich and the details are delicate  understated  and yet striking. i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions.
I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it  which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6" and thin  but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25" in length on my sweater rather than 30" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa
I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.the reader outfits next to the listing were darling. i do not care for the model shot. i think the dress is true to size and well constructed.
Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same  the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length  however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip)  but the overlay comes down way past my
This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing  but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room  it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.
This dress is really cute  it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case  but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight  but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle  but a steamer is your best friend.
This tunic is a wonderfully updated look. it's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line. i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans. terrific look!!
Loved this dress! material is soft... the overall fit is great! the challenge with this dress is the side slits... they do go pretty high... too high for church but may wear them with leggings as it gets cooler... super cute with or without belt 5'9 135 lbs and i ordered a small.
The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height t eh other was so low  i could barely put my hand in it. however  the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice  but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs  but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size  so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.    for reference i am 115 lbs  30 dd< 26.5 in waist.
This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to  but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.
Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too "baggy" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots  but it would also look great with flats  heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!
It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.
Oh elevenses  i love your pants..the fabrics  the details  the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable  professional  well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin  stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.
These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes  the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...
Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition.
Beautiful - ordered a s  i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water  shrunk inches  yes inches! love maeve clothing  this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink  it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric  meaning the dress  is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.  the dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the
I really wanted to keep this dress  and the material is amazing  so soft and gentle and delicate  the design is great  the front looks nice  but from back looks really awkward  big and kind of too loose!
There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.
Got tons of complements and can work for many seasons  just throw a cardigan for fall -runs a little bit and would like if it was touch longer but overall very happy with this find!
I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes  it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress  with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others  the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn't real
After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.
Again  nope. looks chic on the model  looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in "a christmas carol." i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was "shmata" (yiddish for "rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe
Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.
I love this top. i'm not one to iron  so i wash (and hang dry) and wear it. great with skinny jeans.
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size (0) was sold out. when it popped back i ordered it. i am 5'4" and i had wondered if i needed the petite (petite 0 was sold out) because of all the reviews i had read. however  the sleeve length is perfect. in a petite  the sleeves would be too short. i don't have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long. the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style! the lapels are long
I love this top! it is modest enough for work  but fun enough for weekends. soft  comfortable  and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors  though.)  soft flowy fabric  is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!
Cute pattern  but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.
This dress has rich color  excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress.
Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.
Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs  the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally  this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas  and the waist tie ties way higher than
O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.
I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool  soft  not itchy  light weight  lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
This is my new favorite summer dress  seriously. i purchased this dress while there were no reviews at the time but i'm so glad a took a chance. the colors are pretty close to the picture shown; maybe more of a lilac hue than mauve. i normally wear a 6 petite or a 4 regular in dresses  so i went with a 6p. as other reviewers have mentioned  this dress seems to run a little bigger so i could have easily gotten a 4 petite (for the shorter length) and it still would've been flowy. i have chosen to
This top is absolutely gorgeous  but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
The material is wonderful and the dress is lined. plenty of room in the bodice area for a 36d bust. will be wearing a lot this season.
Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.  i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6" these are a miss for me!
When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser
I love this top. the design is very good  i love the pleats at the back  and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l  which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style  with fitted pants it would work well.
Unfortunately  does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
Poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe  and while the color didn't disappoint  everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin  i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear  but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...
This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
You can't exactly tell from the picture  but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom  and it really adds interest to the whole piece. i think my favorite part about this dress  though  is the weightiness of the skirt--it's not so heavy that it's hot or uncomfortable  but enough that it feels more quality  more special.
Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.
I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year. so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day!
It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine  but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.
This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris  and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash  lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a "statement" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is
Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!
I am addicted to these dresses! as usual  the detail is amazing and the shape is so flattering. as some reviewers mentioned  the dress is much more brown than shown on the picture so if you're looking for a black dress  there are others in the collection that are much better. otherwise  gorgeous dress.
I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.
Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!
A nice rayon peasant shirt - like the sleeve length. good for a fuller figure  covers all the bad sports and very comfortable.
I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!
This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliqus and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl
Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference  i'm 5'5  120lbs & ordered the sp & xs  i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist  there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.
Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.
I tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering. the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isn't constricting. i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big. the fur collar is a special touch. the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there. i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there. however  the fit is so flattering i m
Gorgeous top but runs large  especially in the arm holes.
The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.
1. i'm 5'6" tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.  2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size.  3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.
I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.
This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy  but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight  light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all  lends to the casual look. total keep for me.
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.
Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10  sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up  it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
I like the dress on line: color flowers  cut  etc. but when i tried it on it was just meh... the color did wash me out a bit  the flowers are still beautiful  but the cut wasn't as flattering on my body as it was on the model. 0p fit ok  but i didn't keep it. you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps  so adjustable  i guess that is a plus.    115 lbs 30 dd  26.5 in waist
These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.
This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump  even 2 years removed  this hits right there and emphasizes your waist  at least on me and i'm 5'5". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an
I drooled over this dress online  so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person  & the drape of the skirt (good quality  fully lines)  i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight  ill-fitting  & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size. it's a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable!
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.
This dress looks simple  but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool  saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.
I agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin .......  it runs really big  it's short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture.  colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.  fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn.  i haven't one positive thing to say about t
Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.
The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
Wished this had worked for me! however  i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin (not so young anymore) don't show. the beige lining shows at the armholes as well. on the upside  it's very slimming even with the stiff petticoat. so cute! perfect length for me. another caveat -- if your back is not completely symmetrical  as mine isn't  the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position. i'm 98 lbs  4' 10"  and the oop was perfect but for the above objections.
I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2"  115#.
This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed  except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5"  122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else  but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also  it is quite low cut  so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason
Comfortable  stretchy fabric; both colors are beautiful
I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!
Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms  the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling  but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look.
Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather  which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels  booties or flats making it extremely versatile.
I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort  it wasn't for me.
Wore this dress last weekend in nyc. wore it from lunch until late night drinks after dinner. walked for hours in the dress. comfortable but dressy.
Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
Thin for this late in the season  but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t  top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price.
I was looking for a dressy shirt i could wear more than a few times. i have a reunion tomorrow that i wanted to wear this to. i went into a store and saw this  i immediately thought this was the perfect shirt. i saw the price tag  and decided not to get it. i looked several other places and i kept coming back to this shirt. i think if it wasn't displayed in the store  i wouldn't have wanted it so much. it is so much more beautiful in real life. the photo doesn't do it justice. i ended up orderin
It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received  but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit  it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and 3 different women at whole foods complimented my sweater. it is soft and warm. would love in other colors too...like a mint green.
I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!
I am 5'9 135lbs  small chest and narrow shoulders. the 6 fits me perfectly. i love the fact that there is a hem  if i decide to let it down just a little. being over 60 and tall  it is so disappointing to find a dress you love but is just a little too short. the fabric is not too heavy for our moderate summers and i think i will wear this often.
I tried it on and it fit like a glove. it was a little strange having a different fabric on the back  but it worked and i am keeping it.
I like the casual  yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back  but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.
Just a ginormous  shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!
I love the fit  feel and quality but i didn't realize these are the new improved fabric denim weave that has almost no stretch.  i usually wear a 28 and i wish i had purchased the 29 or 30 to accommodate my weight fluctuations.  the great thing about this style is that i will not stretch out at the stress points unattractively.
Love this sweater so much that i got it in both colors. got the size small  fits well and keeps me warm. the cream color is very functional. the blue color is beautiful and unique.
I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1  110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model  these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite  be ready to need alterations to the length!!
I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo
Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink  size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly  i could even probably go to an xs  but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.
I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it  there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....
I love the look of this pullover  however  it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.
This kimono is gorgeous and i've gotten many compliments. it looks good with a t-shirt and jeans or with something dressier. i love it.
I love this top  i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate  however  so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy  which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt  the flow of it and the length.
When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out  saggy and faded.  so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
In true cloth & stone fashion  this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small  but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash)  and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down  depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.
I ordered this in my usual retailer size  xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted  i'm only a 34aa  but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26" waist  34" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b
Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!
My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i"m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.
Stretch out fast    5 8 130lb i order size 26 which is my usually size. they fit prefect for about 3hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body. maybe i should have gone down a  sizes. even so i feel like the $$$ and quality don't add up but they are very soft and comfortable  i wouldn't buy them again.
I had such high hopes for this  but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small  but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy  and the back hangs far from my body  very droopy. even if i got a smaller size  the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse  though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design  but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth  rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap
This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt  skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.
These are adorable pants!!! i ordered them in both colors because i couldn't decide which was cuter. they are light and airy  but not see through. they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup  pajamas  dress them up  anything. very comfortable and versatile! i am a size 8 and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. the elastic doesn't pinch  but probably would have if i would have went with a small.
I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package  i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show  a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6"  135 lbs  and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l  thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking  maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl
The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design  it did not work for me.
I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.
This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
I am normally between a size 0 and 2  so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around  so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out  was bagging in the crotch area  sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin  but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!
This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front  that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue  but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.
Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel
The appliqu on this dress is well done. i would recommend it to anyone. the design is super flattering and feminine.
Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
The pictures online do not do this jacket justice. i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it  even before i tried it on. it's extremely versatile  worn as shown  as a layered look  or the zipped "liner" is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer. it's the perfect weight for spring/fall. it's fitted  and so cute. this jacket runs true to size (not large). i usually wear a 4 and the small fit perfectly.
Crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around. the waist section  where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didn't lay well. i am 5'4"  120 lbs  32c  26" waist  and 32" hip usually wear a 0 or extra small in the maeve clothing that isn't a fitted style. i bought the s  which fit well except for the waist issue described above. this is a fitted dress. i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received. it is a great style idea.
This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin  light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.
This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.
This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.
I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun  nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!
This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be "weird".
This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts  sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight  perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely.
The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.
I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"  i'm rather busty  short waisted  and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16  and the fit is a flattering  'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape  but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.
I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun  uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said  there are two issues i wish i had known about  although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also  the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.
I bough the blue color and love it. the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top. it drapes nicely  and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work (i'm at a tech company  so casual to business casual). the ombre color is gorgeous! (the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely).  regarding what other reviewers said: yes  it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped  b
Contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on  it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.
I love the look of this blouse and i like the light weight material. it would require a camisole underneath but could be worn at the office or a night out. i purchased a size 4 and it fit perfect once i was able to get it on so i wouldn't want a larger size but because it doesn't button down all the way and it's so fitted in the waist it was nearly impossible to get it on and off over my shoulders  there's no give at all. sadly i'm going to have to return it.
Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful  but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.
I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.
I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern  but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
I noticed this top on one of the sales associates  and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible  i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material  it is light  and summery.
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!
I saw this dress in the store  there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver  the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person  especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference  i am 5'2"  34b  120 lbs  usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses  i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely  but it is kind of itchy 
From the website picture (in particular  the gray one) this may appear to be "over-sized." i can assure you  it is not. i have to return the small i ordered on the over-size assumption  and hope the medium (my usual size) fits because it's a really nice top. the sleeves and the pattern of the weave give it good pizzazz.
I'm 5'9" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!
I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me. the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in  so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6  but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow  but not overly so  so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything  for many seasons. love the quality.
Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small  and they have a funny smell.
Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i
I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned  the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it "holds" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!
This is a lovely  well-made piece by maeve  a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle  colors are vibrant  and design of the dress is cute  if a bit on the short side.    however  i  like some of the other reviewers  didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with
Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!
Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
I didn't have high hopes for these  because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color  i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies  but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom  so purchased the large  but sometimes i can wear medium  so this is great  being adjustable.
The fit  the length  the color  the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in  and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so  so  beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.
This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose  flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors  but way off.
Based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however  the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.  they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo
This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the "red" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed
Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in  in regular only. of course i tried it on (in the xs regular) and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure. i'm 5'1" and 115 with a 32 dd chest. no gaping or pulling  the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length  with the hi/lo hem to be just above my knees in front. i think
My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great  but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath  but don't even think about wearing it by itself!
This dress is very comfortable  not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!
As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.
Scratchy  wide cut = not flattering  i tried to make this work because i wanted a different  unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either..  it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!
First off  they are much prettier irl than in the photos online. they fit very large on me. i am usually a 8 or 10 but have hips so ordered the10. wrong decision. i needed the 8.
This dress is soft and hits all the right spots. the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like.
The cut of this top is cute. it's a great basic t with a little flare. it's pretty pricey given that the fabric is so thin.
I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink  both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!
Great style and fit. will look great with jeans  skirt or leggings!
I am reasonably petite  but i like sweaters very oversized and large  so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large  the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size  the sweater ended up looking very awkward  with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do
This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer  ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous  free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"  34f  size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami  as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4") and the open lines of lacy  small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through  and the skirt is lined. the re
I am wearing a medium in the photos  my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.
Just recd the neutral & navy in the size s  my usual size in tops at retailer. just a heads up - it's way oversized under the arms. in the fashion world probably falls under the category of a dolman style sleeve. also the fabric is nubby like/pilled look. similar fabric is the 'warm-up pullover' that i recently saw at the store. i have a feeling this may be a new trend. if you are ok w/ the oversized underarms & nubby fabric then order up. if hesitant  wait & visit the store... i love the look of
Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over
I really like this shirt overall. i'm 5'2 and the petite sizes were sold out so i bought a regular. if you are short like me  beware that the sleeves am be almost comically long. while the shirt is stretchy  the cuffs are not so pushing the sleeves up isn't really an option. also  it had lots of loose  hanging threads straight out of the package. but overall  it's a keeper!
This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen  cotton  and acrylic  so it's not heavy  it's weighty. anyways  it seemed to run large just due to gravity  so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers  it's itchy  but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s  my usual size.
Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty  curvy lady this one just didn't sit right  ran a tad large  and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame  may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
Such a cute dress  i ordered the black version. i'm large busted (dd) and the slip thankfully fit (sometimes it doesn't). i'm 5' 4" and went ahead with the regular  not petite  version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short. the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model. highly recommend.
I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.
This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however  the fit is off. i'm 5"1  107lbs  32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it  if it fit properly.
Loved these pants when i bought them but was not expecting them to "grow" a size within an hour of putting them on. i think it's an issue with pilcro. great styling  nice fabric  but buy one size down!
Buttons were broken off when i opened the package  stretchy at waist  not good quality for the price.
What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h
I love this dress! it is so comfortable. the material feels nice and the print is beautiful. the only reason i didn't give this a 5 overall rating is because this fits a little big. i bought a petite medium and the elastic around the top is not as tight as i'd like. it still fits and stays on but it would feel a little better if it was a little more snug at the top. i love this dress because it is casual enough to walk around in but still feels somewhat dressy. i will probably take this dress wi
I finally got my backorder today. i have a feeling that they might have rushed to make these and cut costs during production because as per all the reviews  i ordered my usual xs (122 lbs  5'5"  32d) and it just fits. all reviews previously before the backordered shirts were sent out  stated that the shirts ran big and people who normally wear a medium  bought an xs. i will keep my xs  but i would have purchased a small for a roomier fit. i have to wear a tank under it because it's short in the
First of all  this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute  but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit  i am 5'6"  123lbs. 27 inch waist  32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned  the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my
This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small  ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters  but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!
The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but  it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.
I was disappointed in this vest  it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big  doesn't drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering  looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair!
These are some of the cutest jeans i've seen in a while. i ordered my usual size 28 and they were too big. i'm 5'9" and about 140 lbs. i always were a 28! i reordered the 27  though  and they fit perfectly. the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach  which isn't the case in other jeans. i think it's due to the high waist. they fit almost like a pair of pants. oh well  i'm keeping them. i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable.
This dress was so lovely in person  but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!
I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute  but missed the mark.
I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it.    i will be returning this.
After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m  i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend  unless you wear 3xxxl
This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.
Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.
The fabric has a beautiful drape; the skirt is a nice length  and it blows  moves  and swings in a most flattering way. the gray is a an elegant color  and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events. the top  however  sags  and overwhelms the more fitted lining. too bad!
This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.
Dress is cute and comfortable to wear. i bought the black motif in regular size 0. it fits perfectly and falls just above my knees. i have washed it in the washing machine placed in a large zippered mesh bag and hung it to dry. as mentioned in previous reviews  with the exception of it being unlined  it's a wonderful dress and am so happy to have it.
I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said  the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress  although if you are a taller person  the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.
I am 5' 10" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run
While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
So cute  great for over a swim suit or walking around town. got these on sale. xxs fit perfectly! fabric is very soft  pom poms add fun styling.
Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.
Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.    a must have for the summer!!!!!!
After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up. went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size 4 burnt orange color (last one in stock). it was still marked $79 so i think thats why it was still there.. i crossed my fingers and tried it on  it fit perfect! not to short or tight in the upper sleeve. i'm 5'4" so maybe that's why the lenght was fine on me. if you can find this in your local store try it on. it's really cute and comfortable. i also have the front lace up j
Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4  112 lbs  broad shoulders  athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large  but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed  i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.
Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
I really love this sweater. it is very flattering-especially in the back. and the color is very versatile so it can compliment virtually anything. the tie does not go all the way around the waste which took me a little getting used to  but it is not a problem for me. it is comfortable and keeps to the quality of other boiled wool products. just be careful washing it  i washed mine on hand cycle which is usually fine for everything-even cashmere. but this one didn't survive it. lesson learned  an
It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality  like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall  not the dress or quality i expected :/
Cute and different dress  cute with boots.very comfortable  runs large  could size down
I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.
I have a countless number of maeve dresses  all size 6. bought an 8 after reading reviews and glad i did. fits perfectly for me one size up. only other issue is the cutout in the back. my bra shows unless i'm very careful.
Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3" so it works well
This is a gorgeous lace dress  well made  true to size. a little tight in the neck but not unbearable. lovely for any occasion. i got this to wear to a fancy wedding  it will be my go to dress for fancy occasions.
Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long  but fits pretty true  like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.
I got the green one. as the other reviewers commented  yes  the fabric is thin. however  i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and i've had nothing but compliments!
As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.
Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.
1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6"  135 lbs   size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.  2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean  i felt great about myself. but...wowza.  3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange  they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else.
This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5"4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.
This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant  and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.
I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.
I cannot wait for summer!    when i received this item i felt the same as the other reviewers. it may be a little pricey for the material.  then i tried it on.  i love it. just add some accessories and let's go!
This will be my favorite fall acquisition! looks better in person. very flattering. does run large. love the combo of tan and grey.
I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket  but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room  order a size up. the quality is nice  i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me  just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
I am 5'2" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.
I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist  but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
This dress is the opitome of summer! day or night  running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite. i feel it runs small on the top  i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomier...i wear a size 10 on top and for referance i got the 12. i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomier....imhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my
So  this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said  all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely  and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!
Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors  they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!
I love  love  love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone  and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid  and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back  so you cannot put it on yourself  unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.
This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d  and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately  this top will be going back.
I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there  but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves  and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low  but offered full coverage on my 34a bust  but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice  and it's a prett
So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.
This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage  too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.  i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said  i went with a
I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!
I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
Not sure why this says "online exclusive" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case  this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!
The fabric is absolutely lovely on these  but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin  tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short.     i'm 5' 4" with a 30" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on  which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them  i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.    better for
Loved this sweater but too boxy
I tried yellow motif  but unfortunately  i did not purchase it.  it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...  i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.  texture was ok.  usually  i like a cool touch of linen.  but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.  i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.  only word i could think was "average."  personally  i do not recommend it  but who knows  maybe it is right for you...  so  try wear
This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person  especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower  it would look and feel less "chokey." i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas
Excellent dress for lounging in the house or for sleeping. very comfortable and a little sexy at the same time.
The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt. the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fall/winter. pair it with some tights  chunky knit and booties  good to go. very flattering one. has a slight a-line cut to it. i love love this one.
A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny  winter day. i like the longer length  to the ankle on me  pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere  boxy  cropped sweater. another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater. the fabric weight is good for winter  they do feel a little itchy at first but it's not noticeable after wearing them a short while.
The peach color is beautiful on this jacket  and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.
I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt. it is so soft and comfortable  very flowy and flattering  i have a smaller waist but wider hips  and this accentuates all of my best features! i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion! i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldn't stop touching the material. what a wonderful addition to my closet!
Fits well through the shoulders and arms  but there is zero waist  and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute  but have to return because of that.
I really like this jumpsuit  it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped. love the material and washed up nicely. should be really comfortable.
Love everything about this dress! it's true to size   flows nicely  great quality. it's just amazing.
Good quality  fit and length! love them:)
This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!
I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side  across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser  i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.
Maybe it's because i'm 40  but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big  obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model  so maybe it's a "younger" top. i would have felt silly wearing it.
Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white  because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe.
These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day  they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer
I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.
I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.
I was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter  but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my 5'2"  130 lb  34d figure. the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper. i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller.
I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day
This is not my usual style  but the print is gorgeous and the dress is really high quality. i'm glad i purchased. it definitely runs big- i am usually an xs or s depending on brand but i ordered an xs p. it fits pretty well and falls at the perfect length just above my knees (i'm 5'3  110). it's a little shapeless still but that's the look. i'm still sort of wondering if i should have gotten an xxs but the xs p definitely works especially for the length. can't wait to wear this. amazing sale pri
The heart version is very pretty  i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs  as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me  like 3/4 length  not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  and short.
This dress is perfect  length right below the knee  white slip lining adds to quality  smocking fits upper body perfectly.
I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"  130lbs  with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium  but a small fit perfectly.
I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.  this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!
Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse  worth it if price lower... maybe
Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i'm now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don't flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag  i had a loose
I am 5 7" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back .
I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have
Beautiful dress  just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.
Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed  even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter.
I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still  i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house  doing chores  resting  etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but  around home  it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however  being 5'10" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.
This dress is indeed so lovely in person. i am so glad i ordered 2 sizes (0p and 2p) based on the straighter-looking cut. i am 115 lbs  5'1.5"  adn 30dd bra size. verdict  the 2p fit better. why  the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open (and did# i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress... not an option with such a unique piece.    other things: color: wow  very nice in person  i was afraid that the colr would wash me out  but no  i have very p
I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
I bought this lovely cardigan in the orange color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i wore it buttoned over a slim tank and got several compliments right off the bat. it is a sweet and unique take on the classic cardigan in a way only found at retailer. i usually wear a small and it fits true to size. i did have to return the one i purchased because it had a hole in the sleeve  but thankfully was able to order another. on sale  it's a no brainer!
I took a chance on this in green  extra small (one size smaller than my normal size) because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater. no  it's too awesome to waste as a liner. it's the most amazing cut and fabric. it so flattering and so soft.  please bring back this top!!!!
I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.
It is an expensive panty  but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!
I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
This is such a simple dress to throw on that will give you instant wow factor. you can dress up or down but know that it is completely flattering - head to toe. i am in love with this dress!
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.
I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs  not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got "lost in the sauce". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though.
It looks great on the model but not on me. on me  it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.
Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets
These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.
I saw this jacket on the sale rack at my local store but the size was extra small  and needed a medium. the store was able to order since it showed back order . i do miss the charge send option  but still love retailer! normally i wear a medium in this brand. i received my order today and it's a beautiful jacket however there's a few things that could have been done in the manufacture that would've improved it. one  the jacket is not lined and it would be beneficial if the jacket was lined or even
This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall  but ordered the xsmall. it is snug  but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath  just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.
The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building  but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist  the loose fit at the hips  and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would
I recently purchased this dress in the yellow  which is not advertised online  but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also  you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9" and the length was perfect for me  will be able to wear with heels or flats.
I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person  it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois ("shammy" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik
I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning!
I loved this but it made my stomach look a lot bigger then it is. i would recommend going up a size in it
I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.
The cut is wonderful and the fabric is soft and flowy. it is pretty sheer so a slip is recommended. i wish this dress had a lining like some other dresses i've gotten at retailer.
The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.
I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded  worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!  the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build  small bust. true to size.
I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors  but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat  and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4  so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color  but i still like it.
This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace  black flower appliqus  silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2"  130 lbs  34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist
I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top  not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.
I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.
I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection  due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality  the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.
Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.
These jeans are amazing. they are so comfortable.  they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day. i am 5'4" and 135 lbs and purchased  my usual size 27. i did have to have them shortened   but only b/c i bought in store and did not have the petite online option. i have worn them on several occasions. great purchase.
When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3  32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.
No lycra in this skirt says my label  ignore the website description. it's 100% cotton so no stretch.  me: 28-29" waist and 36" hips. the medium is a snug fit on my true waist. i love it and will be tucking in shirts / tees when i wear it. otherwise it seems true to the pictures  dark and long. the slit opens above my knees (i'm 5'6").  the pockets are in a kind of odd position in the very front but the trick of that is they add no bulk to hips so...it's a win!
I was excited about this dress because i love the colors and print. the dress has no shape though and not in a good way. it's not flowy enough for the look of a shape dress but its not fitted enough to be flattering.
Purchased this maxi dress in blue print  size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model  but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.
I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.
What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color  but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle  this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful  but i have more to wear with neutral. a great  versatile top.
It's such a beautiful skirt  i kept it around and tried it on with every top i own but i could not get the right look. the waist "poofs" out right below the waistband so any shirt worn over it makes you look frumpy. tucking a shirt in didn't look right because of the poof. it doesn't do anything to flatter a figure. the skirt itself is gorgeous. for the price  i need to make sure my clothes make me look good too! reluctantly i had to return it. i was hoping it would be my summer go-to skirt.
Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!
Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for
As much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online  i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size  yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount  the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough  the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref  i'm 5' 5"  32a  115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr
I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately  there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 "3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.
This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black  not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone  under leather  or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops  and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2" and it doesn't look too long  but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!
This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.
This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality  even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...
I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute  soft  vibrant  and a flattering a-line. however  this dress is sized oddly  running at least one or two sizes too small  particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up  and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time  i had some gaping at the straps  and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip
This is a really cute dress  just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size  however i just did not love it. i am 5'3" 130#  athletic build  36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets  which i cannot figure out the purpose  that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress  it bunches out. on my short frame  it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei
The quality of the fabric is good  but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.
This dress is so cute. i couldn't make it work because my long torso.
Beautiful dress  but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off  i definitely don't!
Sleeves were tight  was difficult to put on ?. for the price  you want to love the shirt. sending it back.
This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures! very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable. runs true to size  i got my normal xs.
I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality  and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8  but my store only had a 4 available. it fit  but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model  but i'm on the short side.
I wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad - it just didn't work for me. i am 5'2"  138 pounds (still trying to lose that last 5-8 from my third daughter) and the chest/back of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back. i am normally a size 6 and tried the 6 p  8 p and 8 and they were all too tight in the chest/back. it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses. :(
I ordered this beautiful sweater skirt in petite because i'm too short (5'3") for the asymmetrical hemline. i love the geometric pattern on this skirt and the gold flecked waistband. and the light sweater material make this a perfect skirt for my california fall/winter.
Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!
Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
The material of this dress is really thick and substantial. very soft and it has good movement. the cut was not quire right for my body  unfortunately. but on the right person  this would be very nice. i think a lot of different body types would look great in this dress  depending on where the waist hits etc.
I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store. there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress.
I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging  and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference  i am 5'5"  135  34c and a small was perfect.
Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.
I purchased this  and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green  and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall  unimpressed.
Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.
Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4"  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price.
Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7"  34c  28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size  meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands)  but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit  and are made of a great weighty denim  with very little stretch  the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash  all the lines butterfly
Yummy  soft material  but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like  then this is for you.
I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.
I am 5' 4 1/2"  125 lbs.  and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also  i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color  but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online.
This dress is beautiful on  is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy  it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer  but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.
Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft  comfortable  and cute! unfortunately  it runs to short.  i am 5'8" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn't work.
The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great
Very flattering and love style  print and color. i sized up one size and perfect fit. great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans.
Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
This dress is very comfortable. i bought both the small & xsmall and ended up keeping the xsmall i am 5'4" 125 lbs. 34c
This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7"  and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.
I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
Exactly what i was looking for. cozy  not too warm  fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!
Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available  i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3" tall  140#  36dd  28" waist  35" hips  wide
I love this top. so much so that i bought it in black and red. i do think it runs a bit big. i normally wear a medium or small. i bought this in extra small and it fits beautifully. can be dressed up or dressed down. love that it is a double layered knit too. the fabric is soft and drappy. this is a staple top. looks great with a pencil skirt tucked in. got lots of compliments when i wore the red one. havent worn the black one yet. for reference im 5'9"   weigh 125lbs and wear a 34b.
Easy and fun jumper. runs slightly large. i ordered a medium and returned for a small. can be dressed up or down for a variety of occasions. would be perfect if it had pockets.
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.
I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.
This is a gorgeous top; however  it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors  but this looked timeless and beautiful  like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined  and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted  but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also  heed t
This top is so cute  but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42" and sweep is over 70". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in  but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.
I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.
This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear  but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!
This sheath is extremely well-made  and the fabric is even more vibrant and beautiful than it looks in the photos. my only complaint: it does run a little small in the bodice. my usual size 4 fit like a dream everywhere but the top  which borders on uncomfortably snug. for reference  i'm a full 34b.
I'm very happy with the interesting print and unusual bib design of this comfortable dress. the bib embroidery is off in some areas. i find that the swath of beige to be too much since it almost matches my skin tone. to break it up  i took the unnecessary waist tie and used it as a bodice trim  creatively knotting  tucking and securing with mini safety pins. i purchased the m petite and though it has a zipper back  i did not have to unzip to put this on or take it off. i have a heavily padded up
I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place  the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places  and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!
I ordered a regular size small. would have got petite small if available. still very happy!
Comfy  will be great with a sweater or vest over it.  love the pink color.
These menswear inspired trouser and beyond cute and comfy. great color and fit. soft interior. dress up with a blazer or go casua with a tee. adorable.
I have a short torso and short arms  so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps  but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy "frayed edge" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it.
This sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail. the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though. if you have a chest  it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i don't mind it for a comfy  cozy  soft sweater.
I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still  i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat  i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i
I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale  i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s  but with this one  the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom  and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still  with some awesome heels  this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!
This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan  but the quality and feel are better than usual.
I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.
The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short  heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
I love this dress  it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim  just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)  i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go.
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.
I was really hoping this dress would work out  as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice  but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure  but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.
Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4" too long. i am 5'8" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants.
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
This is beautiful fabric and a good fit  but it's such a pain to get on and off  that i just don't want to hassle with it. the button is in the back  and very tricky to reach. too bad  because otherwise it's darling!
I ordered size small. i am 5' 6"  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.
With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha
This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit  comfortable  adorable print (the blue is stunning)  and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos  but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!
It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.
I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!
First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.
I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top  so i'm curvy  which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l  and while the m overall fit me better  the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d  and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!
I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.    it is a very unique piece and high quality; however  i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes  and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i wouldn't want to size down...)
I love this sweater and the sleeves are amazing. i also love the purple color  which is more of a deep maroon. the material seems to be of good quality. what i don't love about this sweater is the shape. it is very swingy  which is somewhat flattering because it isn't too clingy  but it poofs out a bit too much on the sides  becoming unflattering from certain angles.
This dress is beautiful  it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous  just not a good fit for me  even at a 0p.
This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!  be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!
This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
This is my third pair of ag primas - i love them! the higher rise is nice to keep smooth lines  they're made of such soft material that moves with you rather than restricts you  and the cut of the legs is skinny without being skin tight. absolutely my favorites jeans - retailer  sell more washes and i'll buy 'em!! :)
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer  and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly  but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money  i could get it tailored  but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!
I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.
When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough  but it has a weird under wire  it makes my chest look strange  like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately  this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous  which is never a good feeling. i recommend  but only for tall  slim types with a small bust.
The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it! i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else!
Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
I was specifically looking for a nice pair of high-waisted jeans and this pair fit the bill. i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the 4 rating on design  i would have preferred a finished hem. i am 5'4" and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans. i have had them for a couple of days  still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues.
The fabric is really itchy  i felt like i was wearing a carpet  and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.
I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv
I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.
I bought this dress with my birthday coupon  i love the design of the fabric  and i think the length is great. it's a lightweight dress  which makes it a nice for more seasons. sandals in the summer  light sweater in the spring/fall  and tights  slip  and heavy sweater in the winter. the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it  which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater. the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all. very satisfied!
I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders  and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however  it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed  and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest)  and as i head
Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist  this won't fit well. too bad  because it's super cute  if a bit sheer.
I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red  yellow  or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring  summer  fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it.
There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye  but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.
I love these jeans! they are super soft and just the right weight for year around. however  they do run large. i normally wear a size 27. i am 5'7 and weigh 127#'s. because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue  i ordered a size down=26. they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange. these are perfect. i get tons of compliments when i wear them...i would love to see coh make them in a true black.
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.
This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it. it is very soft and cozy. i went with the m/l cause i preferred the longer length  even though i also fit in the xs/s.   i have worn it many times  and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace. when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers  i throw it on when i get cold-its like a cozy hug. i highly recommend!
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!
I bought 3 of these tops in different colors  the blue one had one sleeve noticeably shorter. sent it back. now less than 10 days later they are on sale. the style is darling and get many complements on the two i have. fyi i'm a 36d 130lbs and med fit great
My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it  and the little  fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green ) and the double stripe jacquard skirt  but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable  with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however  one i put it on  i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also  the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.
I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l
I ordered the ivory in size xl. it fit a little on the small side. the knit was good quality as was the lace. unfortunately  the mock neck was stiff and uncomfortable. the sleeves were a little too long for me as well so i returned it. but  it's such a unique style and good quality.
I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece  great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt  3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!
I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the
I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned  the red is gorgeous! very saturated color  just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"  135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length.
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
Good quality jeans  but had to return  as they did not fit my curvy hips.
The design looked super cute online  but in person  the material seemed cheap. actually  at least in the green one  the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material  it would have been much nicer.
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!
I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear  and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized  delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts  pants  dresses etc. buy it  especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.
The fabric is beautiful  a bit sheer  but overall lovely. however  the sizing is really off. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14  and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very  very nipped right under the bust. so  if you have no bustline and a super small waist  this top is for you. if you are like me  high waist and straight up and down  this is a pass. in fact  it is really h
I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
This is a precious! it's a little thin  as i prefer a thicker fabric. however  wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!
So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater  but so light that you can wear it for summer.
I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled  but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny  and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny  not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again  maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle
The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics  but in person i found it femine  pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky  colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy  gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.
This top is perfect for summer. it delivers style without the bulk. the peplum hit perfect for my 5'4 frame. unfortunately it was too low cut in the front. i had to return it.
I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"  120 lbs  straight figure  very tiny "girls") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the "swin
I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big  hangs just right  arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans  shorts  or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh  slimming too!
I'm happy i bought this top. it's very cute and almost a little immature/childish  but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good  though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women.
I saw this in store  but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however  i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans  but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.
Don't get me wrong  this is probably cute on someone else  but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed  it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this  size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.
I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender  but hey  im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats  sofa  etc. i made the mistake of not washing first  but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.
What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.
This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6"and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim.
This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable  with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale
Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.
I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however  it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut  fabric  and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston  sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize.
Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine  however  because of size and price.
Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice  heavy knit-like material  but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.
I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium  even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.
Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.
I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women  this rare pair of pants crosses the divide  flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here  i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .
I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.
I ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess  is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin  itchy  doesn&#39;t drape very well  and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.
Love this dress so much  i bought the checkered  and then had to go back for the black! it is so worth the price. i wear it with sandals in the warm weather  and a blazer with boots in the cooler weather. it is beautiful and so flattering.
Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me.  fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt.  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try.  i don't think i have the right personality for this one.  looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!
The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(
This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4  116 lbs.  size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down  without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty  the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi
I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.
I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as "runs large" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo
I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful  the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35" long  and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy  but it was really  really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.
When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.
The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.  now the cons:  this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.
I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere  more so than i thought it would be. but the neck  there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top  material is so-so.
I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.
Beautiful dress. loved the navy and the low v neck in front and back. but i had to return for smaller size. i am 5'2" 114 lbs. i ordered small and it was a little big and definitely long. i returned for an xs petite and am hoping it will fit perfectly!
This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m  only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift  i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings  soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe
Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
While this is gorgeous in person  if you have a larger bust the v-neck will look really weird. because its so deep  it gets skewed(i'm a d cup). if only the v were 1 or 2 inches higher! unfortunately it's going back.
I didn't mind the "scratchiness" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable.
Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning
I wanted to like this romper  it is very cute and colorful  but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.
I love the style  easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality.
While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.
This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric  beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.
This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing  the length is great (i'm 5'5" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee)  and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron.
I bought this in purple and then just now in navy.i love the sleeve length and neckline. this shirt is made of a very soft knit material a so its very comfy and flattering. goes well with jeans  shirts and shorts. i definitely recommend purchasing this shirt.
Extremely pretty swimsuit  gorgeous cut in the front with the lace and the floral print  very flattering to hourglass shapes. coverage across rear end is a bit less than i would prefer  but it's so very pretty that i'm keeping it. several comments from friends that this could be worn as a tank top for regular wear it is so pretty.
I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said  this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders  so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted  but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the
I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5"  135  34c-6.
Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9" so normally wear medium. however  could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!
This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.
I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
At the beginning of summer  i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft  open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately  even though these are made of mesh  these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas  new york  new jersey  and florida. i thought they'd be a good  pretty choice. but  the material with the gathered waist & wrists  trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer
Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.
I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish
This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles  even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.
I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i'm 5'4"  118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one!
This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
I tried the size small on at my regular store  and thought the subtle  sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful  though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders  neckline and armholes  and the lower hem.  i ordered the small petite online  hoping that it would fit perfectly  but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.  i bought the dress
A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.
Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum
Long  thin  tunic.  perfect over leggings  great for casual day but look pulled together.
Fun top  5'4  135 lbs and i ordered xs. it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great. i like the fun slant to the side. not tight on stomach which is great! :) great top.
I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.
Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.
I loved this dress especially because each flower appliqu was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliqus are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.
I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric  which is soft  lightweight  and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun  and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width  for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes  but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough  and the shirt hits me just at the hip  not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a
These jeans immediately caught my eye online  and when i saw them in the store on display  i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit  and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today  and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.
The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
Pretty top  i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
I tried on xs in the store (returned) and it looked huge on me  i like the rushing idea  the material is super soft  but overall  couldn't justify even at sale with 40% off  as it wasn't flattering when it looks big. blue color nice in person.
I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.
I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5"  128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though  but i was really hoping to find a nice  versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f
Like a baby doll top  with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears  i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.
I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little "stiffness" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!
I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time  thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i don't live close to an retailer  i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal  this sweater however i was swimming in  like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn't impressed with the material either  it f
I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but  the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down  they seemed too floppy.
This dress is so cute but it definitely is highly as other reviewers have stated.
Had to have these when i saw them online. usually an ag girl  but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit. originally ordered a 28 and returned for a 27. after a couple of wears  wish i bought the 26. a must have!
I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a "petite" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th
Love the collar  cut is cropped but i'm wearing a tank under for hole coverage anyways. no complaints!
This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating  but as soon as i tried this on  i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3" for reference and even at 5'3" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller  i would recommend the pe
I'm 5'5" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say "oversized styling" - unfortunately will have to return.
I ordered the white "denim" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering  but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!
Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!
I'm not in love with this  but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s  and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b  26 inch waist  120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso  and i realize the design is for it to be flowy  as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model  which is
Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
I am 5'8" 140 lbs.  34b  and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but wasn't at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews  i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however  i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half  thereby making me look larger than i am  so i sent it back. otherwise  this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein
This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does  it feels soft on the skin  light-weight  and has a nice bounce to it. it's
I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
The drape of this shirt is flattering  and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light  and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater  it will be great in winter  too. so far  i've worn it with jeans and booties  and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.
I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole  which is fine  but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist  booties and maybe a hat.
The dress is gorgeous  material is soft  great design! but runs at least one size small and very long. i'm 5'3 and even with 4 in heels it's way to long. alteration needed
Dress is lovely - the sleeves were shorter than i thought but otherwise nice fabric and very pretty cut!!
This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.
This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said "wow that's very elegant". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality
I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves  the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!
This dress is absolutely perfectly delightful! fits like a glove and is stunning on. i couldn't be happier with this purchase! i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time. i usually struggle with dresses because i am under 5 feet  i purchased a 0p and it fits very well. no tailoring needed. only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone  yikes! i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and
Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5"130lbs  and 32dd.
I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.
I ordered this skirt in both colors and they are just to die for. the fun fabrics make it a playful and trendy take on a timeless essential  and the fit is incredibly flattering. an added bonus: the fabric has give so it's also extremely comfortable. i hope they come out with more color options!
I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.
Loves it!! this is my new favorite top. it's pretty...it's perfect:-) cannot find any bad to say about it.
This dress is very  very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long  coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there  it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!
Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit  just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top.  .  i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34"; fuller thighs and bottom  so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.   .  co
Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.
Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.
I loved this skirt but it was slightly too small. i did not realize it pockets which is always a drawback for me in dresses/skirts. i have an hour glass frame and the extra fabric from pockets is too poofy in my opinion. beautiful color and high quality fabric/
Stunning on  but mine was missing a button when i received it. i found a similar button and replaced it. still worth it  even though it arrived "damaged"
I've been looking for a mid-weight  shrug-on cardigan for a while now and i've finally found the one! as a petite (5'4"  130 lbs) lady with big boobs  i hate clingy cardigans with buttons since they are just so unflattering.     luckily this cardigan is warm without being stifling  fitted in the sleeve without being impossible to wear over clothes with different-length sleeves  and perfectly cut to slim even thought it is shrug-y. i especially like the back details  which are even more curve-fla
This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.
I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate  i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
Love this bra! i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect. it's exactly as pictured. i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile  but it's really durable! my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side  but it doesn't actually look awkward  just feels a bit odd at first. i highly recommend it if you're looking for something sweet and sexy!
Great petite maxi! i'm 5'3 and it skims the top of my feet. soft  fits great and went right into my suitcase for my upcoming  trip. can dress up or down.
For some reason  the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them  as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad.
This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.
A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.  the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.  i chose the white. it definitely runs large  so size down (i.e. wear m/l  chose s).  the fabric is linen  very itch  so tank is probably needed underneath.  flattering fit for curvy figure.
I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway  i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs  5'1.5") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft  nad looks like it may not wrinkles  which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute  but you can't really wear this untied  so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)
Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful  the color lovely  the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror  it just was too much material  too big a bell shape. oh well  still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.
I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the "skirt" is adorable.
I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.
I love these pants! they are very flattering. they do however run long so even though i'm 5'5'' the regulars were crazy long on me and the petite fit me perfectly. i was worried they would stretch out a lot but i've worn them twice and they haven't.
I love this top and cannot wait to wear it. the material is a nice weight  the color is pretty  and the fit is very flattering and comfortable. be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily.
This is a very cute top. my only reservation is that where the elastic is on the side sticks out a little more than i would like. it's not that big of a deal though.
I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality  so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!
This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.
I love this dress (i bought the navy with white stripes). it is comfortable  flattering  and versatile. best of all  i received a complement from my husband  who never comments on my clothing! the drapey knit fabric fits closely (but not tightly) in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body. the fabric is soft and stretchy  not too thick  but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath (i am 5'4"  123 lbs). i wore this to a christmas party and
I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall  i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...
I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however  after i washed it the first time  it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.  did not look at good as the beige.
I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.
This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big. this went back  will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp.
This coat is so lovely  it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color  the style  the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons! like other reviewers  i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning  the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night  i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas  i am as yet
I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large  i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall
The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.
This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special  yet everyday! i ordered the black  and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.
On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.
I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
Love this length  print and material! have already worn 2 times and wears and washes well! sleeves are short than pic shows but i don't mind...
I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.)
I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.
Beautiful color and flattering design! cons: tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing. i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron. i didn't even have a chance to wear it  but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price.
I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs  36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.    the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as
I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton  i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high  which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can't resist this skirt. if your tall  this is a dream. if your petite  you can
The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out  the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down.
This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldn't believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6  32 h bra)and the small was perfect. can't wait to wear it!
I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale  but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well. it's a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time. it looks about the same as it does on the model color/fit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar  which makes it more interesting. i'm 6ft tall 160lb  ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized  but with tha
Purchased on sale  would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.
I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress  too cute!
It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be
Love this dress! it can be worn in cold or warm weather with tights and boots or sandals and bare legs. the fit is roomy and a little longer in back. it washes nicely without losing length.
I love these jeans! another winner in the pilcro line. i took a size 29. i normally wear a 30/31 depending on cut. i am 5'4 inches and about 150 lbs curvy with small waist and the 29 fits comfortably and very flattering to my figure. love the button front and the red details . i recall having jeans like these about 15 years ago and this cut is so perfect   cute and stylish. the regular length hit just slighting above the center of my foot so wearing with flats will be perfect  i am not a high he
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple  chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality  the dress was 100% see-through  very thin  and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk  i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality)  but after trying it on i was really disappoin
This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style  quality  and color is incredible. highly recommend  even at this price. you won't regret it.
I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper  this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee  so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.
Great top. i got the size 4 but i ordered a 6 and plan to return the 4 depending on how the 6 fits. the top is really cute but it fits just right and i would like a little more room. when i raise my hands the entire shirt raises up. otherwise cannot wait to wear it and this is a great purchase.
I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.
I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8" and slender  but with a 36' bust  and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit  but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re
A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.
Yes  this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25% off. it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day. it's true to size: i'm 5'6"  150 lbs and m fit well.
The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however  while i liked the irregular hemline on the model  on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern  definitely no dryer on this one.
This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.
I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it! on the site i thought it was just "meh" but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected. it definitely runs large  i sized down to an xs (usually a s  size 4/6) and it's still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy  the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck isn't at all tight. it's soft and just an overall cute sweater!
I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and doesn't seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.
Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right  not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen  very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.
Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
I wanted to love this dress  as the length  cut  and color are exactly what i've been looking for. but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is.
Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat  even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!
Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention).
Love the style  fabric and fit generally  but even ordering down a size  i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size  but not sure it will work as much as i want it to.
Love these pants. also ordered them in blue. great fit and style.
This top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.
These are a lovely neutral to slightly warm grey pair of jeans from a great line. i wore my usual size without issues.
The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t
I would have to wear a camisole underneath this  which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear  not something i'd have to layer.
This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely  rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit  but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"  140  straight athletic build  size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.  i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store  i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!
This dress can be casual  or you can dress it up for going out. i just love this dress!
This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.
I purchased this dress for a summer celebration. i am petite  but ordered the dress in a misses size (one size smaller) because i wanted it to hit right at the knee  rather than the shorter above-the-knee length pictured. i loved all about the dress - the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip.. i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone. i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles.
Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
I love the overall look and feel of the dress. my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and i'm not tall. i ordered a small and i'm 5"4 130 lbs bottom heavy. the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well; however  i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise.
I just tried on this dress in the store  in red  and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however  the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips  causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than
I am 5 8"  130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely  it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!
I tried on the skirt today in the store and immediately fell in love with how fluid the fabric is and how it looks and feels on  but i had something really awful happen  the zipper was hard to zip up so i just left it partially zipped but close to the top but then when i try to take it off the zipper broke and split down the middle but it was stuck on me! it was the strangest thing that i've ever had happened  and really embarrassing because i had to come out of the fitting room like that to get
The jeans are even better in person. great fit and the color is nice. my new fave!
This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!
Just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans. love love!! very flattering and plan to wear with skirts  on airplanes for warmth and for travel. very versatile . highly recommend .
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight  easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer  but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small  and it fit perfectly - not tight  not too loose...honestly  if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!
This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!
This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!
I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy  hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!
Love this sweater!  lightweight  comfy and does run large.   i usually wear a size 12 or l/xl in sweaters cause i don&#39;t like them to fit tight.  i read reviews and ordered a medium and it&#39;s perfect!  can&#39;t go wrong!  i ordered the red  but am now thinking of ordering the grey one!
This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty  but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work  but it was just so impractical.
I saw this in store and had to try it on! it is really cute. i love the different textures and the red drawstrings. it fits well  although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes. i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it. really cute and i have never seen a coat like it!
I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it  so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because  yes  this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.    the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long  you end up clingi
The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.
So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise  excellent.
I really love the color of this item. it is very generous in cut. i would suggest sizing down as i like my clothes more fitted. i received many compliments among my colleagues who wearing.
Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.
I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit  great color  so comfortable! however  i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so  now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable.     i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference  see my stats. i bought a 26.
I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10  and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.
Loved the style  ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders  boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy  fitted business slacks. midday  i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say  it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i
I originally bought this dress in the store. however  it ended being a size too big. so  i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived  i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may
Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.
Based on other reviews i had no doubt this dress would be perfect.  it truly is a work of art  however it just wasn't "me" when i tried it on.  i'm sure for others it will be perfect.  my biggest issues were the sheerness of the top portion  which is obvious in the photos.  i was hoping it would be less obvious in person.  also the elbows of the dress were tight  so it was difficult to bend my arms  and i have pretty slender arms.
I love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes...
Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10"). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.
I'm 5'7"  130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am  and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.
Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold
Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.
I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.
It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec
This sweater runs oversized; very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall. love the sleeve length.
Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top  and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on  and once on  it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.
I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it
This is a perfect sweater to dress up or dress down. very comfortable and stylish. i love the slits on the side. works great with skinny jeans or leggings.
In the photo of the dress  you might have a hard time telling that the top half of the dress is the "lace" part  and is a stretchy knit fabric  while the bottom half is polyester and not stretchy at all. fyi: 36c (34d)  short waist  broad shoulders/back  usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress the navy lace of the top  as i said  is knit. therefore it was too stretchy  and the straps actually were already too long. it was so loose  that i needed the smaller size in the top half of the dress (10).
This dress is awesome! love everything about it  except the colors! the pink is ridiculous  it is like pepto on crack  there's no way  outside of being a bridesmaid  i would ever wear that shade of pink. nauseating. i would order the turquoise  but i don't think i want that either. plus the pink was the only color offered in the store  even though i saw the dress offered in black online at one time. why wouldn't you stock the black in-store???? i can no longer get it.    you need to offer this d
Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs  you won't be disappointed!
Very happy with this online dress purchase! it fits tts and i love the ruching. i've already gotten compliments on it!
I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so  i have bought 3 new pairs  and all have been so disappointing. first of all  the quality is horrible now. in the past  they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened  pilcro?!?!?
I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work  with jeans  or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8  i went with the 8 in this jacket!
This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.
These pants are so great. very comfortable  true to size  and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer. i'm 5'1  120 lbs  and my usual 26 petite fit great. these would also make excellent travel pants. i purchased the green color  and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review.
I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls
I got this vest on sale in the navy color and love it! the quality of the fabric is great and the draped design of it is so chic! really adds a stylish touch to almost any outfit.
This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white  but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!
I am 5' 4" and 120 lbs. i bought the xs as my frame is a bit on the smaller side  but the cut is huge. a pregnant woman could easily pull this off as a very cool maternity dress. i can see it being so cute with a pair of boots or sandals. i wanted to get the xxs  but it's sold out so sadly will have to send it back. but if it works for you  definitely buy it!
I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous
I must admit that i was a little hesitant to try this top on  largely due to my shape.  fyi: broad shoulders/back  36c  short waist  5'3"   typical size: dress or button-down shirt 12  knit or not fitted top  m  i purchased the heart design in a size m  since the upper part of the shirt is oversized a little bit (not too big and baggy  though) and then narrowis to the waist. think "upside-down triangle"  as the shape of the top. since this is also my shape on top (6 on bottom)  i worried that th
This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
I love this dress. i am usually a size 4  but ordered this in size 0 and it fits perfect! great for any season  and can dress up or dress down. the pink is the perfect shade - i feel like i'm elle woods!
I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a "slight" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu
I am petite  5'2  and i ordered the xxsp  i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large  it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.
The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.
This is really cute online  but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder  but the material is very thin  and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.
I love the colors. however  $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric   no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).
I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it! this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve  mock neck collar  and slightly flared silhouette. it's so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look. highly recommend  would have gotten all colors!
I like design of the dress  softness and color ( i got grey)  the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.
I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size  this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.
Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school
Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!
I got this dress in the holly green and it's a lovely shade - perfect for fall and winter. this is why i gave it the high rating. however  be warned that the lining is very form fitting. i thought the dress had more of a fit and flare design to mask flaws like a belly and larger backside  but that's not the case. i had to return it  but for more slender-shaped ladies  the dress is likely a winner.
I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.
I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.
I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall  or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!
Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did! it fits like a dream! this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried.
I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.
Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!
I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4"). i'm thinking about having it altered  not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out  it may be a better length for taller individuals.
This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size  xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket  although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right  not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me  but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over  particularly making my waist look small.
I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.
I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top  but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck  but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit.
Pretty and with pockets! also  nice quality for the price. interesting texture.
This dress is fantastic.  i can't help but think the other gals who gave this a low rating were perhaps more petite and didn't size down.  i am 5'8 and usually a 10-12.  purchased the 8 and it is great!  fits wonderful and looks so nice for the price.  i like clothing that doesn't touch me and this does a great job  without looking sloppy.
The dress is too loose and runs too big
Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0
I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.
I ordered this in an 8p yellow. the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping it'd be  but i'm keeping it because it fits me perfectly. i am chesty for my size (32ddd)  and somehow i don't look bigger than i am in this top. i also have broad shoulders and this doesn't feel tight when i move my arms. bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place! i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f
I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.
Retailer sleep pants are my favorite...the only sleep pants i will wear. fit is perfect. flowing shape and ultra-soft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury. first thing i put on when i get home from work!
These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
This is such a great top! it runs huge though. i normally wear a small but bought the xs. it fits ok. i would prefer the xxs  but i bought it on sale and retailer is sold out. for reference  i am 5`6 and about 138 lbs. very flowy soft fabric  great purchase.
I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium  but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale  the price is reasonable.
The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top.
I got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though
You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference  i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed  and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.
I had my eye on this tee for awhile  and finally ordered the turquoise/navy in the small. as soon as i received it  i ordered it in the taupe/peach and am contemplating one more! i plan to layer it now and can't wait to wear it solo next spring and summer. the colors are gorgeous (although the taupe is more dark gray which i love)  the material is very soft  stretchy and comfortable  but it's the very flattering cut that sold me. it hangs beautifully and doesn't cling to my middle but skims it p
I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material  this did not happen! this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn't last.
Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item  totally worth it.
This dress is beautiful and unique. an eye-catching piece with a bohemian flare. you will not be disappointed. tts.
Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6" and got a large. with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls.   ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess
I'm obsessed with this dress.  it's so pretty and love that it has a lining.  i'm 5'1" and got a small  i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didn't look swallowed up in dress and now it's perfect.  still has the swing but not as bulky.   can't wait to wear it out!
Love this dress! very soft and easy to wear. i'm 5'4" and it hits the top of my knees which is perfect for me. can't wait to wear it with white leggings and boots this winter. i've seen several similar styles and tried on a few at other boutiques but they were thick material and bulky denim. this is the perfect  light and soft to the touch. highly recommend!
Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday  and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully  is nicely lined  and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long  but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!
This sweater is very comfy and looks great with tighter leggins. beautiful color
I sized down one size and it's still too big with the double v-neck style. this is going back.
This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact  it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size  not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute "lounge at the lake" ensemble.
This is super cute. i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and it's quite roomy. i probably could have sized down to an xs  but i like the relaxed look. there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise it's a beautiful and unique top.
Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too! it is longer on me than the model (and i'm 5'10") and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans. i also wear a white tank underneath just in case  otherwise i think i'd be showing some skin. i like that the front and back are two different materials.
I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it  making it even harder to get off. it was returned.
I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.
Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.
I just purchased this adorable drop waist dress on-line and personally found it to fit tts in my regular size small (34d-27-35). the length in the front hits right to the top of my knees  perhaps a tad longer so it's not too short for me (i'm only 5'4") and the back is longer in length. there is also a detachable matching cotton slip that snaps on or off the dress that has adjustable straps that hit just above my knees. i love that this dress was made from cotton and the color is just as picture
I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well  maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!
Great structure
I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite  but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose  but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2  107 lb  32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit  like a centimeter  but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp  i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though)  but i fold the sleeves up at th
So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
While i had high hopes for this dress to be my "go to"  unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame  however  the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra.
Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok  though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!
This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..
Every single time i was in a store  this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however  so when a free shipping offer came up  i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better  but a little snug  so if it shrunk  i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one  it would have been the large; however  they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger  but on a body  it is
I picked this up at my nearest retailer this afternoon after placing my order a few days ago. i purchased the off-white version in size small. i actually tried this on in the dressing room to make sure i was satisfied with the product. when i came out  i asked the retailer customer service rep if she could cut the tag off so that i could wear it out today. she not only helped me out but also commented on how much she liked this sweater while also wondering why she hasn't seen it in store; i informed
This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion  it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking "maternity". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i'm usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for
The photos don't look it  but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.     disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!
Great top  lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops  but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer  but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.
This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.
I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.
I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8" curvy 32dd
Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.
This is a nice  heavy sweater for cold days and lounging in jeans. very comfortable and flattering.
Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.
I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large.
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!
I love this piece! they're calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants. i usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall. size down to avoid the potato sack look. i think this piece is so great for fall. definitely a must buy!
I have a sillier style sweater from moth that i got last year and love. this is not as great  but i like the style so i will keep it. i knew the sleeves would be shorter  but wish they were made full length with a little less "bat wing". the color is close to as shown- maybe a little lighter. i was hoping for more of a navy since that is what they are calling it- but this is more of a denim blue.
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
Wow  this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?
I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress  but not a major deterrent.    i'm 5'6" and about 145lbs  and the size 6 (my usual retailer size) was perfect.
I'm 5'2  105lbs and bought xsp. seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover  but not bad enough to return. everywhere else fits tts. nothing stunning about it  but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual. it would be better if there are more colors to choose from.
This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps  but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe  you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate  it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long  like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo  but i actually like that even better.
Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.
Beautiful and stylish. looks amazing with my new black suede over the knee boots! i am 4-6 on top and curvy 6-8 on bottom so aline skirt is great (interior slip is tight straight skirt rather than a-line  which dropped one star).
This dress is beautiful. it is longer than it looks on the model (i'm 5/5) but drapes beautifully. it is perfect for a wedding or a special event. i love it!
This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes. i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it. it is unlike any fabric i've ever had: a soft two-ply  almost gauzy cotton. one cute detail is that the "inside" layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer. so cute! and so soft! one thickness above cheesecloth  i would say. and like cheesecloth  it has a natural "give" within the weave  but it is not stretchy. the shoulders
Fun socks you will want to show off. design is printed on a relatively thin (trouser sock).
Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.
Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric  and has perfect fit  nice arm length  looks good on the hanger  the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded  in the mail  so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket  tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put
This shirt is amazing. it's soft  comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great  the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back  creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice  long  and fitted.  this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture  color  and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.  the col
This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also  you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!
Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.
Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews  and because i am of short torso  but it fits well. would definitely recommend.
Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly  if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect  it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate
I really wanted to love this dress. the pattern is so much prettier in person. i typically wear a medium  sometimes a large in tops. the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest; the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas. the front of the dress goes up pretty high (for someone with a large chest) and flows down. there is a tie in the back but it doesn't do much to help with the shape in the front.
Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra  but after 3 kids  braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said  the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely  and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so  this one is going back.
The material is horrible  it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not "flow" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning.
I am 5'2" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.
Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point  as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
I purchased this online and absolutely love this:::: it can be dressed up or down. i received many compliments  its also so soft and very comfortable!!! a must have!!
True  this blazer runs small  so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue  the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and it's got a super-soft lining.
So cute  warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood  for the win!
This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons. if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size. as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me. it's beautiful! and comfortable.
Had to take a needle and pull threads to the back so not visible and i see this as an ongoing problem.
I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately  the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size  i am 5'4"  130 and ordered the 6.
I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped  so the hip area looked terrible. but  the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas
I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless  the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person  shorter tops look best.
Ordered online and love it exchanging however from s to m 'cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season:)
Yes  this is a beautiful print and fits perfectly...but it's unlined thin polyester. full price is pretty ludicrous on this one. tts  but might need to size up if you have a larger chest (no stretch). hoping to grab on sale.
I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.
I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
I tried this one without a bra  and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.  the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides  so where the seem is on the legs by the wait  didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that  but hard for me not to look at.  also  the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite  but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that  the hem went to below the big part of my calf  so it 3was flatte
Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.
I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
I just received this dress in the blue and its very small in the ribcage/bust area. i'm 120 lbs  5'1  34d bust and i'm always a 2-4 regular or a 4-6 petite in this brand. i couldn't even zip up the 4 regular all the way. i will probably reorder it in a 6 and an 8. great material  beautiful color  great style.
I originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color  which is lovely and vibrant. the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering. however  it is also very  very cheap. after about five washes  it has pilled and worn  the color has faded a bit  and i doubt it will make it through the spring. for perspective  i wash all my clothes on cold and use the "air dry" setting on my dryer.  nonetheless  even having experienced the wear and tear  i went back and bought this shirt in every other
I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts  but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!
As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality  well fitting leggings that do not slide down  shift around  or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want  nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep
This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy  and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner  and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.
I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t
I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.
It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
This is a very soft and feminine chemise. it is a little more see thru than i had anticipated  but i still love it!
I love this skirt  in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however  being suede  the skirt was very bulky. also  at 5'8" and liking skirts to be long enough for work  i typically don't have problems with long length. however  i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they'll make some updates in future styles.
Cute top in theory...ended up looking a little sloppy. the sleeves are a bit too "blousey" for my taste and i really wanted the lace-up to be cuter  somehow. still a cute top  received several compliments  but not for me.
Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
I run 170lbs.  36 d  5'4" and ordered a regular 14. probably could get away with a 12. i didn't order a petite because i wanted the length. however i ordered the 14 because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage. it fits to perfection everywhere - but the waist. it's very loose. they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model. the picture doesn't clearly show the hi-low concept of the hem. i like that so it isn't a problem. very unique a
This looked fabulous on the model  of course  and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs  i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback  but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference  i have a 33" waist and 42" hips.
This is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.  i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.
Very pretty. love the design both front and back
This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
I had never worn pilcro jeans  and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on. i couldn't be more pleased! i wear a 26  but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans. these fit comfortably and don't feel too tight  but are fitted enough to look great. i like the little bit of extra room around the top  allowing the jeans to feel comfortable. i'll be back for more pilcro jeans!
I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality  not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look "vintagey". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!
I think of tracy reese as running small  and usually size up  but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage  so you need the right bra.
Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate  but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.
I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt "wing out" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.
Ordered the nude color for my daughter. love the color and the style. it's a.comfortable looking top. i pressed it before giving it to her. seemed to wrinkle easily. that's why i gave it three stars. probably wrinkle less if it had some polyester in it.
I love the color (coral/pink) and the open shoulder design of this top  but it's too blousy at the bottom (way too much fabric). i ordered a small. i am 5'4" and 120 lbs. i might try an xs if they still have them in stock. fabric is comfortable. the ties on the sleeves add a special touch.
I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable  it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9"  145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it.
The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.
I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
For reference  i'm 113 lbs  with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft  comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line  it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also  it is a "mixed-media/material" type. for example  it's linen with soft leather accents  which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar  on the wrist area 
I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model  but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath  i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer  and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried  these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing  i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.
I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt
This top is feminine and sexy. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i love it and will hold onto it forever.
I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however  sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1"  113 lb  and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end  i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t
On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.
These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually  if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).
Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!
Gorgeous suit! one of the most well made suits i've ever owned. sexy yet provides great coverage. do note the sizing is per australian standards. i had to order a size up.
This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work  so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.
I have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often. however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all.
Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way  it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.
I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange  labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well  the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous  sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller
Really soft and perfect for work or leisure! fits a little large but ok. i usually take a small or medium (size 8 or 10) and the small in this jacket fits nicely but a little big. very comfortable. will be great for travel.
I tried on the xs in the store  and i don't need a petite in this  but perhaps a xxs. it is on the shorter side  so no great on my muscular thighs (if petite) whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee. the cut is away from the body  a bit "a-line"  but not fitted. the colors are gorgeous  but i think this is more of a casual dress  like brunch with the girlfriends  for example. love it... it is now in my wish list for alter :-)
I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
Bought this dress for my boho bridal shower and loved it! it was perfect for the season and fit like a charm. i normally wear a 4-6 and needed the 2 so heads up that they run a little big.
This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down  but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.
I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r
What i love especially about this dress are the comfortable  soft fabric and the shape of the back -- the scoop and longer back hem are very ballet dancer! the green & off white print is very pretty for spring. sizing is a little tricky for me as i'm between petite and regular sizes. the hem length in the sp is perfect  about 1.5" above the knee in front  but the waist sits a little high. the top seam of the waist section is above my natural waist  and the bottom seam sits right under my navel s
This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7"). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top.
Beautiful top!  had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose.  it will look great with dark jeans and mules!
Unique design. love the collar and broad cuffs. the xs regular fits me better than the s petite  which is a bit short.
Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!
This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
I don't usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price  i really love the style. i like that it's made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up. looks cute both ways. i ordered the xs which is usually my size. it fits perfectly. i imagine the s would have fit also. it hits just at the hips. i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer  but it's not a deal breaker. my one splurge this summer.for reference 123 lbs  5'5'  32 d.
I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store  and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l  yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!
I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost  this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
It's amazing!    i did size down on this one  but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area  but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem  but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my
This top runs a little large. i should probably return for a smaller size but figure after i wash it  it'll shrink a bit. it's very flattering on and i really like the asymmetrical design. the only thing i don't like about it is that the fabric is a little itching without wearing a tank top underneath.
I love the sparkled fabric and intricate design on the back. i had trouble with the front because the cowl exposed a bit too much  so i wore a tank top underneath. ordering a petite may have helped with the cowl.
Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno  she is correct on all counts: pretty colors  quality construction  ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway)  oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which
I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.
As a beach cover-up this would be great  but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
I just received these pants and they are really cute. they are casual but i think with a cute top/jacket and heels they can be appropriate for a fun night out or casual date. they are really comfortable but they do stretch so size down for sure. i am 5'5" and weigh 130 lbs and wear a 4/6 in antho. pants that aren't chino fabric but wear a 28 in designer jeans. i ordered a 26 and can probably wear a 25 when these stretch out. i will keep the 26 but they will be baggy. i ordered the kakhi and the
When i saw this online i immediately put it on my "must buy" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily  my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol
This dress is a beautiful  classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.
If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.
Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit  and large sizes if they run small.
This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
First  it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.
This top is beautiful in design  but sadly  i will be returning. it is hand wash  and even after doing so  i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
Tried this on in the "onsie" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of
Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed
I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"  it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.  also  it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.  too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking.
I'm a petite girl  5' and 100lbs. ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being "short" or "cropped". this sweater is adorable  not itchy in my opinion  and the lenght is just right  not short  not long  however it may be a bit short for tall girls...still think it's worth a try.
This dress was love at first sight.  i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool.  as another reviewer said  it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am 5'2".  it shrank about one inch in length only.  i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful- that's a plus! i was comfortable and cool all day.  get it before it is out of stock.  this dress will not make it to sale.
This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!
The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.
Great skirt  can be dressy  work or casual  love it!
The hemline on this is somewhat see through and that makes this denim skirt really stylish. the waist runs small so i had to return my size for the next size up which was still a bit snug. but the skirt is so far beyond the normal  ho-hum denim skirt i just have to keep it. at 5'3" it hits just right  slightly above the knee.
This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can
I love wearing this sweater  it is unbelievably soft and cozy. usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me  so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame. i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am 5'3" 120 lbs and it was long  but not at all overwhelming. it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day. i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels. would look great with leggings and bo
This blouse is flattering and fits great. i also have the other color in cream with the floral design. very nice!
I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue  it's fun  it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite)  but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great  and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.
Cute socks  very comfy as well. good quality in person.
I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?
Expected them to fit somewhat loose but actually tight for a boyfriend fit. like a slightly relaxed skinny with a really low crotch. stretches everywhere when sitting and walking except the waistband. the distressing and fraying holes in good placement. wish there was some on the back of the leg but i have yet to find a pair that does that. good color and quality  but not quite worth full price. will probably look for them on sale later. i always prefer skinny jeans over boyfriend do it might bi
I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i'm usually xs or small  and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can't compare  but the small was flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'5" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple  neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it  so it's probably not great for hot da
Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
Love the tee in the red. it's not too sheer and the metal detail on the shoulders turns it from a simple tee to a tee with a little more pizazz. fits true to size. i take either a medium or large in retailer and this in a size large fits well. it is a bit boxy  but not sloppy. on sale it's a great deal.
This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show  but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear  this would be super cute.
Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!
This dress was perfect for the fall/winter. i wish i would have bought more colors. the fabric is soft and clings just enough. i lived in it this winter.
Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black  and it was perfect. i am 5'3" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it  but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer  so you can "see" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it  which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine  but now i will be looking for i
I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate
The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.
For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better  but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me  and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders  and 34d chest  so the top fit as it should  just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw
This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful  vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty  swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs  but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly  the arms were cut too tight  the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
I bought this shirt in the rust color along with the blue/black sweater skirt after seeing it on display in the store. not sure i would have ever put those 2 together but i love the outfit. i'm not much of a shirt-tucker  either  but this shirt works either way. tucked in a skirt or more casual with jeans. my only criticism is the static cling in the front  as mentioned by another reviewer. i had thought of getting it in white  but if it's shear  then maybe not. haven't been wearing a tank under
Being that i am short  5'2"  this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5". long leggy types could easily "rock" this.
High quality  yummy soft fabric  gorgeous color. even with those three pros  this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2" and 150 lbs  size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one  however has capri pants  hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall  thin woman  it probably works!
I tried on the refgular xs and it fit  btu the cut was wring on me  i moved up the dress as though it was cut "petite" and what a difference! i will ahve to roder the petite for sure.  te material is a thicker knit  very strectchy and warm enough to carry the dress through winter and spring. the shoulders are well covered  in a flattering way. the chest area is crossed over "open"  not stiched close  so yo ucan adjsut as needed. te "tie" jsut falls but is attached to the dress on one side  so it
Great peplum top  beautiful whine color. very thick material. i'm hourglass figure  36d top so it was very flattering
This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet  that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the "hem" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.
This top can be dressed up or down. i got it in the blue motif. it is so cute and that wearable  washable fabric. i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too low-cut (i.e. professionalism). this top fits the bill while still being fabulous. of course it is loose-fitting on the bottom  as the image indicates. it is a swing top. i recommend with skinny pants.
Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..
This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however  the embroidery was beautiful
I purchased this shirt in the novelty print  very cute. the shirt itself is fine  slight relaxed fit  thin material  purchased in a small (normal size)  it really was the print that sold me. on it looked very cute and just really liked it. may not be worth the $58 i paid for it but would be a good pick up on sale.
This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy  not black. very dark navy  yes. still  not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top  and i can wear it right now.
This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on.
....but not for me. i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in  but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs. right out of the bag  i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper. however  i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on. from the pictures  it looks like there is a small opening  but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back. this may not be the same for a taller person s
Was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.
36dd  10/12 in tops  12/14 in bottoms  bought size m/l very cute pattern on the grey leggings  and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too  so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug  but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.
Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well  i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough
I ordered my usual size small. i din't notice any fit problems after taking a quick look in the mirror the first day i wore them to my muscle training class. (this garment is more skin revealing than i really like  but i need to stay cool in the summer heat.) during the work-out i noticed that the leg edges of the shorts showed fat bulges; this was ugly  embarrassing  and unnecessary since i do not have overly fatty legs. later i noticed that the low-waist line of the shorts showed bulging fat a
Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock
I so wanted to love the striped peplum top  however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)
Lovely feel to this almost-cowl neck turtleneck. it's quite thin  and has 3/4 length sleeves  so it won't keep you warm. but the fabric is soft  the ribbing is flattering  and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy. overall  a good staple that's a bit more interesting. the mauve-ish color looks great with grays.
I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos  because of the wrap style  the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem  though if you lift your arms  your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small
I saw this in the store and fell in love with it  i didn't buy it at first but i couldn't stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it  its soft and very comfortable  im glad i went back for it.
I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it  but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy  but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.
Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured  which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips  so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure  but wasn't amazing for me.
I am a sweater girl  so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers  i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured  but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi
This dress is gorgeous  flattering  oood quality and  in my opinion  better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black  rather than nude liner  which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on  practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug  though  but at least it's stretchy. that being said  it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
I love this dress! it is comfortable and pretty  well made and classic. it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big. i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect. i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also!
Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired.
I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked  it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels  or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide
Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend
The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater  or a sleek turtleneck  and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.
Bought this tank on a whim  but i'm so happy i did! so flattering  comfy and well made.
I love this t-shirt  i feel classy  stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted  it is bellowy in the peplum  but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!
I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size  2p  and had to have it. i bought the white/black one  and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.
I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large  so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side  super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly  not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the "giddy up" embroidery work at the neckline and the
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.
I kept stalking this cape on the site since it went on a few months ago and finally decided to pull the trigger. this is an absolutely gorgeous cape.perfect for hourglass figures because of the waist-defining belt. its a really modern cut - it reminds me of some of the red carpet cape dresses of late. its so elegant - this is a timeless cut. the nude is a gorgeous  rich warm brown color. if you're really busty  you might go up a size to get the girls covered. i ordered my usual size m  and i may
This is festival dress epitomized. flowery  flowy  romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern  but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem  i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.
Truthfully  i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist.
First  i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short  because  well  it is. that being said  it is a perfect length for someone who is petite  like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets  which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size  is wonderfully warm and cozy  and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)
I love this top and the beading is beautiful  but just like everyone else  it was way too large. i normally wear a lg  but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.
I usually have to order a size up in ranna gill dresses because of tight bodices. i did this time and it's too big  so i would stay tts or size down depending on your bust size. color is more moss/olive (green with a gray undertone) than shown online. no liner and the fabric is a smooth polyester that feels more summer weight than autumn. gorgeous embroidery on the chest. teeny tiny neck button closure and fussy side zip. i am 5'3" and purchased petite but it is still too long unless i wear my f
If you haven't yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon  now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy  elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful  put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size  i am a 4 and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5'10. form fitting but still a bit f
These weren't what i expected  but i kind of really like them. they have a very high rise  and so they end up being high waisted. the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable. however  the fabric is very stretchy  and i'm not sure i can wear them to work. but they're a little fancy for the weekend. the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black. all things i can work with  but they are a little different than i imagined. they are quite long -- i'm 5'8 and will likely have to
I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous  and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.
It's hard to find a comfortable  attractive tee. this one is it for me. ordered a large. it skims perfectly over my back and lower half. no grabbing. sleeves are cut nicely for those of us who don't love their upper arms. the lacing adds nice detail and interest. it's soft and comfy. it's an unusual color that will go with almost any bottom. great now and under a jean jacket or cardigan as the weather cools.
I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping  love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait. this dress though i couldn't do it  i had to have it. i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july 4th get away. get it while you can.
Man  this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves  so current. unfortunately  it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small  and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair  so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!    i am keeping it because i love the style  but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.  i got the x-small and am a 3
This sweater was unflattering me  very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off  however this one went back.
I just got this shirt the other day  and already love it. it fits like a basic tee  but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom  which makes this really comfortable.  my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back  but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too  so the quality feels nice.
I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m
This sweater dress was incredibly soft  and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately  i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on  but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist  because the quality is lo
Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
So much cuter than the picture. i bought a m and i'm a 34c i thought it was comfy n flattering
This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.
I am 5'3" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall  it just doesn't work. also  i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.
I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable  and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic  which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree  but for those of us who are busty  it's an opportunity to wear a cute  breezy style with buttons and a collar!
As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me  i tried it in a small  medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2"  145lbs  36d. the dress is really pretty in person  but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9"  100lbs  34a  also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline  however the neckline is not open like in the picture  it's more pushed toget
This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality  but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big.     the fit is tts  though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.
Comfortable top. would have been nice to have it a couple inches longer. pretty colors (the floral pattern).
One of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time. i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box. the only problem is that it runs short in the torso. i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie. for reference  i am 5'6" 120 lbs  and a 34b. i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small. hopefully it's long enough!!! everything about it is true to size except torso length. i have an average torso  so someone with a large torso m
Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
Let me start off by saying i never write reviews  but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi
This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it's very comfortable as well. unfortunately  it got ocean water on it in my photos  so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6" and wore sandals and
I am so in love with this skirt  but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color  quality  and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back.
This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case  the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.
I love the ruching on this hoodie  which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small  34b  130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).
Love this dress! really nice quality  timeless design  not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look  but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large  so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever  modes
Cute black t-shirt that runs absolutely huge   i ordered  the extra small  because the extra extra small  was sold out    the extra small  was not even close to fitting      so disappointing very cute t-shirt for very big people do not buy if your petite
Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size. thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.
I was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit  it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
This dress is soft  comfortable  beautiful and drapes so nicely - not tent-like at all. i wasn't sure about sizing  and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down  but the small in the strap/underarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium. as another reviewer noted  you cannot adjust the straps  they are stitched together not tied together. i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock. i cannot wait for it to arrive! perfect for summer  or fall with a c
This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.
If you think you can pull this off by all means try it. the fabric is excellent quality--thick yet soft  and the floral print is lovely (unlike a lot of the prints this season). i am not exactly short (5'6") and not wide (34-26-36)  but this made me look like a houseboat. too bad  as it is such an interesting cut. i ordered down since i can sometimes wear an xs  but the bottom was still voluminous.
I'm 5'5  145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red  medium and love it. yes  it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions  didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is  love
Super cute dress - swingy  flattering  easy to wear. the pattern is great  and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short  so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6  but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.
The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through  just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
I got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous.  i'm not so much into wearing a farm animal image  but the colors are just too striking to pass this up. the sweater is tts  but with a slightly baggy fit. i did not find it scratchy.
Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
I love these jeans and have been wearing them a lot now that the weather is turning a bit cooler in my area. i like that the cuff is not sewn in  so you can wear them with a cuff like pictured  or fully unrolled/down. they are a bit higher-waisted than i prefer - kind of an awkward waist height in my opinion. and they are very stretchy. i was torn between two sizes so i went with the larger. i wasn't sure of how to mark how they fit because they are somewhat fitted/slim in the thigh area  but th
Really soft and roomy. very comfortable. just hope it washes well. nice alternative to the regular turtleneck. i wanted it in both colors neutral and green. unfortunately  the neutral did not work for me.
I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.
This looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.  a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.
I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but
Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs  etc.)   you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.
I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting  but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area  which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe
This sweater dress is so soft and great quality...you can dress it up or down... i will get a lot of use out of it!
This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest  so it's not meant to be fitted  so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops  i went with the xs in this  and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great  very versatile  simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!
I probably would not have purchased this sweater had i only seen it online because i typically think wool is scratchy  but this sweater caught my eye in the store and it is as soft as a sweater can get. i love the pink with the gold trim. it is so soft and warm. i have washed and worn it a few times already and have not had any problems with stretching  either.
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like  this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.
I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one  the length  the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also 
I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.
Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
I love this top  it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small  it is true to size. very classy!!
The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.
I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.
Very nice sweater  surprisingly just as pictured color-wise  i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders  but this sweater flair out to the bottom  you can kind of see it in the photo  the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit  the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the
Lovely dress but runs at least a full size too big.
I've had my eye on this for awhile  glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color  soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.
I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!
The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however  the armhole is way too low  which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low  most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!
Just picked this up at the store 40% off sale price  well worth it! the petite hits perfect on my 5'3" frame  right about where it hits the model in the pic. very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often.
I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve  you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck  so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better
As another reviewer mentioned  maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4  and while it fits  i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared  but also short  making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable  i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don
The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites  but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well  if not better  depending on the length of the outfit!  ______________  pros:  - looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.  - well made  good stitching  solid dress.  - great length in the sleeves.  - fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my
Loved this jumper  i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach)  so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!
Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.
The cotton  the print  and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful  i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a "puff" to them that i don't notice on the model  and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else  it's nearly empire on me. and  there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig
This is a very pretty  particularly youthful dress.  but  do be forewarned  it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do  and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite  and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).
The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work.
Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(
Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6    i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif
The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on.     as noted by other reviewers  there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.
I originally bought this from my local retailer in an xs petite. i think it was a return. i brought it home and decided it was just too big for my 5'4" 116# frame. i ordered it in an xxs petite and am keeping it. the colters are just so pretty and it is machine washable which is an added bonus. it is still flowy but not objectionably so. it is meant to be unstructured and bohemain i think. looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming trip to italy.
The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model  maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers  and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again  could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy  ill just have to make it work.
The dress has a partially sewn-in slip  which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.    i ordered a medium  and if it hadn't been for the slip  the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd.
The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.
These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.
I'm 119 and small frame  but took a chance and ordered the m. so glad...the fit was perfect. the robe is soft and beautiful!
This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that  but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back  because i didn't say "wow  i love this" w
I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still
I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them  i didn't love them. i love some stretch  so that part was good. however  the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.       i really want to love them  though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect  which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway  they do have a cute shape  bu
I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very "80's"!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors  but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you  but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size  but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on.
I tried this on at the store and had to buy this dress. it's adorable on and the fabric is really soft. very flattering too!
Well made dress  but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty  but the dress is too long  as well. as other reviewers have said  the front is too low cut  but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me  sadly  i'll be returning it.
This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest  size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however  my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on
This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.
Cute casual skirt  i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work.  i had to size up  which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because i'm my athletic frame.
As the previous reviewer mentioned  this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft  high quality material  and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c
I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now  and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny  thin  and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting  a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very "gypsy-ish"...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of
These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed  with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny  which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim  but went down to a 28 in this style.
I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.
I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived  it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty  muted pink.  however  once i put it on  it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it  it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress  it would have been a yes. overall a great dress  but probably for another body type.
Great top to dress (further) up or down. it does  however  run large and the straps seem (too) long. if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations.
I am typically a small at retailer  but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty  and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals  and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress  though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si
I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks  lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me  tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.
It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size.
I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however  in person  it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
I find that petite gals with short ( muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors  quite lovely and subtle  there is a nice stretch to the pant  the waist has nice closures  can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (115 lbs  26.5 in wiast)
Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy  which i like. absolutely fabulous!
Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.
Great fit. smooth  comfortable material. wrinkles  but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors  i got both the teal and the black.
I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however  the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter...
This dress is very well made and the fabric hangs beautifully. i weigh 125 and usually wear a small but sized up to medium for a longer sleeve and hem. the print  fabric and style make it appropriate for daytime or evening. it should transition nicely to fall and will look great with boots.
I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3" and 110lbs  for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute  just a little loose through the body.
This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer  but the color will work for early fall too.
Love the print and loose fit. doesn't look to wide on my top heavy torso and the sleeves don't cling to my chubby upper arms or tummy. wore all day today  first with shorts then with cropped jeans.
I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4"  so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!
Just picked this up at a store....had a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray. super soft fabric and not too short for a 55 year old. i'm 5'5"  135 lbs  and 34 d and the medium is perfect. sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this. i'll wear without a belt...it falls nicely and is very flattering!
I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived  i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store!
While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7"  128lb and ordered the small.
I love this dress! it was a tad long ( i'm a shorty) but i loved the cut and versatility of the material/ design that i took it to the tailor. now it is perfect! i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling. love.
This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.
I bought this dress in store today in a size 4  i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress  there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email  and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it  as it is a beautiful coat online. however  once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168  and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.     perso
I love the fit of the peplum top. it's flattering without being too full on the bottom. the print is lovely and great for summer and spring!
I love this piece  it fits well and is comfortable. you can dress it up or be more casual. i have received many compliments already and it goes with many of my outfits.
Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything  the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds.
I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...    firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr
I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one  it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer  and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.
Loved this top on model. even happier when it went on sale. sort of boxy. but still excited  then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric! disappointed. my other tees i purchased are fine.
This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer. the fit is great. i'm 5'8" and 145. i ordered the small and it's perfect.
This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy  cool weather!! the white one goes with everything  and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy  quality mater
This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals  but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos  the dress is baggy and empire waisted  and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie  and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy  such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.    anyhow  i wanted to share photos of the real
I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls  which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also  the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on  went great with those colors but i think it wi
I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.
I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.     my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress  i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink  i would've hand wa
I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .
This top is super cute  nice and light for the hot weather  with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra  so it shows through. but  with a black bra  there is no problem.
This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price  it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
I wore these with high heels to a formal gathering. i received many compliments. perfect for summer. you can dress them up with heels  or wear flats or sandals and be casual. i have a pear shape  so i think they fit best for my body type. love them!
I highly recommend this top. i am busty and was concerned that it might not be flattering. but i find it flattering. i also don't have the greatest arms  so i wore a crisp white top underneath. see my pics below. hides any tummy pooch and is so flattering. runs tts. i ordered a small. i'm 5' 120 lbs. the petite might have been too short for my taste. don't hesitate!
I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).
There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...
I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front  so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size  if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall  i'm pleased with the look.
Love this tank! i ordered a small and it fits beautifully. i am 5'5" and 140 lbs. . tank is sheer so i wear a cami underneath. length is quite long but i wear it with skinny white capris and it looks chic. my only concern is the raw hem edge. worried about how this will hold up with some washings. other than that i love it. i received many compliments when i wore it.
Love this top and the fit is very true to size. i am 5'3 and 144 and ordered a medium. the fabric weight is just right and not see through  the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tent-like too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out. wish there were more color choices to order from. it was touted as red motif but i would call it more red-orange. i cannot wear orange but it is "red-enough" to pull off on my skin tone with the white background. the sleeves
I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light  comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable  too!
I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose  these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .
I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.
I love these pants! first  they are super flattering. for a new mom  the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second  they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats  boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large  because they aren't too loose.
I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says "viscose lining" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us
I love the style of this dress  but unfortunately  it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also  the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.
It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.
I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.
Whimsical and elegant. fits a bit snug in rib cage  but that works well for me. i'm a 32c.
The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip  and the length is spot on  but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.  will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.
Super cute t-shirt keep in mind to is fairly long
I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft  with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10"  160 lbs) and it fits perfectly.
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
Material is too thin and quality is poor
The softest cotton gauze but  not see through. relaxed but  the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress  going back for it in white!
There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...
I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin  which is nice for summer  but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly  it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.
I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color  soft faded pink  which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size  i wouldn't size down because these are"t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable.
I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
Love this dress and so does my boyfriend. took my usual size 2 and it's a little snug but the 4 would have been too big.
I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
Very comfy and warm! i love this! i bought the xs even though i am usually a s or xs.
Very cute dress  but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
Although it was a bit of a battle with my bra straps  it was completely worth it for date night. hot shirt! very comfy and quality fabric. next time  i may just pin or tape my straps...
I love the design and the fabric  but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress  but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted  who knows?)  so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric  it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
I love this shirt because when i first saw it  i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip  wore the tie in the back  and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet  but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
To my knowledge this dress looks great on everyone. the fabric is light and of moderate quality  the finishing is acceptable. a great basic.
I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can't recommend a size  because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming  the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers  and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i'm 5'6". it appeared overstretched  and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth
Love everything about it!! chunky  comfortable  lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!
I had a feeling this might not work for me  so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c  and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.  if you're petite/smaller framed  this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty  this doesn't do us gals any favors  in my opinion.  it is a lovely top  and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom  the inner lining was decent 
This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.
If i ever find something i can wear sans bra  i am pretty much going to buy it. just looking at this dress i wouldn't think it possible  but it is! this is a rare occurrence for me! honestly  the dress is a little tight a pulls a little bit across the chest (32d)  but being able to go braless trumps that for me. hopefully it isn't too noticeable... i did find the straps to be extremely long  so i had them shortened. this dress is adorable and i've received so many compliments. it's so comfortabl
This is a pretty dress  but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.
Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful  soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight  no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual  easy  pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.
I found this top to be quite flattering.........the slight give in the outer straps is necessary to allow for arm movement without issue.  i did not find it to diminish the aesthetic value.  i purchased it in white and loved it so much that i ordered the black also....not much of a pink person or i would have gotten that one too!  classic with a bit of a casual edge.  a must get!
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
I ordered the xl in the blue version and the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the material is very thin. definitely need a tank/cami underneath. the pattern is adorable. the colors are much brighter in person. it's such a fun tee for summer. i just wish they hadn't sewn the sleeves in the various places. it's a little awkward. it shrank while washing & air-drying so it needed to be reshaped. if you get it and it's running a bit big  washing it will help with the fit. i like pa
These pants fit great  true to size  heavy enough to withstand winter  and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw.
Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6"). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)
I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy  which is a pity  because i do appreciate the design. :(
I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5'8" and 140 lbs. so it's unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps  but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance.
This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!
I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose  yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available  too. i would definitely buy again!
So glad i purchased this tunic! just lovely. can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer. necklace friendly too!
Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.
Love it - love the color  fabric and buttons. really comfortable! relaxed fit
The neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two-tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
The fabric is so soft  but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn't flatter my body.
I tried on the grey version in store  and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee  which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however  the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.
Fit and flare  pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
I really love the pattern and the look on the model  and i thought i would love it. i ordered online  so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on  it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well  and has a lining  and the waist has extra fabric for the design  and it has pockets  so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad  because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.
I like the make of this dress  the fabric is thick and light at the same time.  the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous  nice details. the buttons are sturdy.   i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest  but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser  so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee
I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly  but a little baggy under the arms  and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
A nice comfy sweatshirt. i do wish it was just a tad longer; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i'm only 5'3! (i purchased the regular size not the petite)also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside.
I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit  i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.
This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.
I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1" and the regular length worked for me.
Interesting  slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.  would recommend as a maybe.
So i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all  5"2. had to go back.
I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.
I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it  but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
This print/color combination is really pretty. i think it's a little muted compared to the picture  but still very pretty. it is definitely longer than expected - i'm 5'-5" and it almost touches the floor. will definitely need to wear with heels. colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals. it actually has a shorter underskirt  so there's no accidental show. i really like the dark blue wrap #extra fabric at top# - sits below the waist and will help hide imp
#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts  this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful  but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
I bought the "here comes the sun" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life  instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so  i love this shirt. i got it on sale  but it still could've been cheaper.
This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
I love tracy reese dresses  but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations  shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure  and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made  and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate  and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.
Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
This top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full  shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..
I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom  the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!
A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.
This dress fits perfectly. the cut is so flattering. i am tall but the length is great. not too short.
Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros  and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer  i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!
The design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however  it's extremely see thru.
This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it's really stretchy fabric too. i'm a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted  so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.  the other thing that's nice is that for short people like me (i"m between 5'2" and 5'3") it doesn't drag on the ground; in fact it fits me
Beautiful  unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.  i usually wear a 10  but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine)  i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said  i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.  other reviewers have noted that the emb
Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit  i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!
This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute  but a little bit odd  it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.
I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small  thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants  a size 32c bust  and 5'6" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant  it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr
I'm usually a small (5'5"  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect
Twirly full skirt!  me: 5'6"  130lbs  34/35a-28-36. tried and pictured the size 6  a perfect fit with a bit of give in the bust for a larger cup size.  i'm not particularly curvy and i felt this added a waistline to me  i think this is an almost universally flattering cut.  material was soft and an easy wear.  simple enough that i think it will wear for quite a few years.
This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me.
This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
This sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust  otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.
Fits great and the material feels great on! going to buy a second one in a different pattern.
The flow and feel of the material is really nice  however  i think it runs large. i ordered a small  and i have exchanged it for an xs  which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there.
But the back of it  by the waist  bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger  it will be too long. but i love the skirt  it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured  just below the knee in front. the waist is snug  bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs  26-27 in waist  short legs...)
I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.
I really liked the fabric and look of this top  but i was swimming in fabric.  there was so much that the top felt heavy.  i returned it.
Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return
Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low. a medium fit me perfectly. i am 5'8" and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes. the colors are sort of fall  but the top is like a sun dress. i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories. i wore it with a 3/4 length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct. and it was perfect. the fabric feels nice  great quality. it's on sale so you have nothing to loose!
This dress caught my eye in the store. it's lovely! i don't think i would've ordered it (it's hard to see the charm in the photo)  but i tried it on because the colors are so pretty and the fabric has vintage look/feel  and i couldn't pass it up on sale. i usually wear a 6  but i bought an 8 because the saleswoman said the sleeves run small and there isn't any stretch in the fabric. both are true. i tried on both dresses in that size  because of color placement and to check on the sleeve size. b
Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium  it was apparently not available in the medium  i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website  medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable  but really liked the dress.
This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look  i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.
I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.
This top was really cute on someone else  but not on me... on me  ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too  just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season  it is a bit boxy  but looks nice with jeans  white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...
I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size  as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
This top is very cute. the fit is great and the material is very comfortable. i am a 5'7  135 lbs and wear a 36d and the medium fit great!
I love this sweater! the sky color is very flattering in person. i love that it looks good open or closed. i bought one for my mom and me. i think it will be very versatile. i think it runs mostly true to size  possibly runs just slightly big.
Wonderful summer blouse!. prefect with jeans or shorts. very flattering on my older  curvy body.
I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on  the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.   if you have a tiny head and pencil a
Pros: material is amazing  super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this  just enough  it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders  chest and the length is good.    cons: the "waist" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8"  150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too  which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.    i'll pro
I really wanted to love this dress....     i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly  the top was just too "balloon like" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.
Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days  while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.
I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.
I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top
The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but  the fabric looks like old  matted carpet. i will be returning.
Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.
I am 5'4  34c  with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much  so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however  the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate  so i was willing to make adjustments for it.
The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy)  but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected  but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.
These are the most comfortable  happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4  and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long  but after washing and drying on low  mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops  and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how "modern" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and
I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!
As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top  the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece.
I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.
I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!
Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made  not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty  this is not the dress for you.
When i first saw this in the store  i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress  i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party  i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up  you will be rewarded with a comfortable  versatile dress that can be super casu
I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye  skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.  i'm 5'7"  wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty  it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest.
Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.
I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.
I'm usually wary of light colored knits because they can often be thin and see through  but this one had nothing for me to worry about. this had an adequate thickness which does not leave me freezing and i did not consider it sheer. i find that the sleeveless turtleneck design can be versatile for the seasons. i plan to wear it with a cropped denim jacket and boots for colder days and sandals on warmer days. the material is very soft. the cut is true to size to large. i went true to size because
Originally ordered a large but it was huge. the medium fit perfectly. i'm 165lbs  5'7". lovely material and interesting side details. the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick. lots of compliments!!
This is too much fabric for me (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist  short) even in the smallest size  but i saw another costumer try it on and it was sooo lovely.  the fabric has a shimmery thread  very pretty. the cut was super flattering on her curvier body  it was gorgeous. she tried it on with boots  and also put on a long vest over it every way was beautiful  jsut not on me  sadly. so i say give it a try  may work for you.
For reference i am 5'5" and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design. the skirt fit perfectly  but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt. the quality is great but the design and color is not. the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture  more like a dark red wine. it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric
I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50  even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish  and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri
Not a huge fan of this dress  will be returning it. fits too big and not flattering. fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have. color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.
Is a great top for layering over leggings  running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price  i just didn't love it.
Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt  jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.
The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim  rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans  however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!
Fit  length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.
I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however  not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming  which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. let's hope i'm wrong and that it lasts!
Bought this for my daughter. it's adorable on her. we're going to take it in at the waist so it doesn't look so sack-like; then it'll be perfect!
Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.
Love this top  you can really fess up  i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds
I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.  i especially love the design of the trench with the wider  pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic  unique design for
Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch  so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look  and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top  and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me  but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g
I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.
The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything  but the fit is ??!! at 5'9" with a long torso and broad shoulders  the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all  bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7" uber fit daughter had the same issue  and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned.
Picked this up in the store today  but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo  but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing  but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short  i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1"). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately  they are all sold out of size 24 :(
The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.
Unlike some of the other reviewers  i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?  the colors  materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact  it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.  one thing  the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online  howeve
I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on  but didn't fit me.
I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10  even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa
Really like this dress but.....  the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.  impossible!  has to go back
I tried on the pink version  really nice  the fit is loose  but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall  very nice.     xs fit at 115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist
I expected better from this top  it is thin  will snack easy  and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price  not worth it. definitely returned!
I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.
Love the colors of this dress. it did run a little large. i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium.
Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering  and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size  oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt  and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits  would be a nice 3 season skirt!
This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp
I love how this dress is photographed  but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress  but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.
I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful  good quality  and a perfect summer maxi. however  it was way too big. i'm 5'6  118 lbs  i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress  so i choose to get it tailored.
These paige skinny jeans are lightweight  snug  super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.
I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on  it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny  accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36  5'8" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett
I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one. unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
Perfect top! i love the mix of materials  silky in the front and comfy knit in the back. the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt. happy!
I was looking for the perfect july 4th weekend dress  with enough room to be comfy (and eat!) while also being chic and feeling cute.    i got countless compliments on this dress.. the design is adorable  and the fit is really flattering. i'm 5'4" and i weigh about 128 - i normally would have worn a small  but i had to spring for the petite xs. the design is a bit big and billowy  and anything else would have swallowed me up.    overall  great purchase. i am in love! :)
The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality  i just didn't keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn't look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also.
I love this top  but i washed it once  in cold water  and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back.
I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress  but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin  taller person.
Do not waste your money on this.  at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.   fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.  still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.
This top is stunning. the colors are vivid and it is extremely cozy and soft. however it seems delicate and would need to only be worn once in a while. it is not an everyday top. the material has a cotton candy like appearance. it really is unique and one of a kind.
Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!
This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.
These are so comfortable  it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.
Love this comfy  breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets  which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals  so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use  the dress is darling.
I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model  but if i was to tighten it  it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite)  and it looked huge  when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work  it was a lot of fabric  and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall  so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look  this is great. i would  however  order eptite for 5'1.5". (115 lbs  03 dd che
I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.
I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy.
I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.
This duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth. looks nice over dress  jeans  crops. just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit. best part of the duster....it has pockets!! i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go!
Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.
Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.
I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie  this item was too small  especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful  but unfortunately  i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.
Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch  fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined  but great for weather in 50's-low 60's with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look  wish the pockets were just a bit bigger  i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it's a keeper.  i ordered m/l and am usually a medium or la
Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
Very comfortable and stylish. can wear with tights  as a dress  or over jeans. cute any way! the material is not super thick  but not too thin.
Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back
I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.
I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right  it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point  but with the 25% of full p
Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both  especially at this price.
The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.
I was so excited to try this dress  but after ready the reviews i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6"   134 lbs  and wear a size 6. well  it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however  i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr
Chambray top that is soft  but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked  the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic  almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing  and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms  and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4" about 130lbs  athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well.
This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.
Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.
The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants  but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation  so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway  since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.
I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
I tried on the pink in xs in store. it was so big on me. i wanted to love it  the stylist did  but i felt meh... so did another costumer  didn&#39;t like it on me. the colors are really nice (and the blue seems really nice too)  but the cut was a little wide. fabric is very soft. for reference  i am 115 lbs  0dd  26.5 in waist.
Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it
I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd  i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
I got this dress in the mail  and while i loved the concept of it  it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist  it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting  and to me  made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good  but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot  but it would have still been a shapeless dress  just bigger. it does fit true to size 
I originally bought this jacket in a medium  but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big. i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did!! this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size. i normally wear a 6.
I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight (feels delicate) and to the floor. fell in love with the watercolor print. this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini. beware- if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach  make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super see-thru  which is my least favorite part of this piece. i couldn't get to the petites sizes before they all sold out  so i'm crossing my fingers th
I love the fit of the stevie jean. they are not too tight to make them inappropriate for a mom/teacher  but are definitely not your momma's jeans either. i have two pair (gray and a dark denim) and both fit perfectly after a wash. however  the waist stretches out throughout the day enough that i have to wear a belt which i never do! i could probably size down  but i didn't want the thighs to be too tight. for reference i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. and wear a pretty standard 2  sometimes 4. i bought these i
This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little "off". would have loved to find the ivory in my size.
Just came today: the print is gorgeous.  very bohemian. it's a dressier dress with the chiffon.  on the con side  the chiffon is very delicate  snagged easily while trying on. there's raw edges on the waistband  needed trimming fresh out of the package.  sz 10 fit in the waist  too small for 36d bust; sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist.  sz 10 ankle length for 5'7"  12 hits the floor.  haven't decided if i'll keep the 12 and try to alter.
Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses. i found that colors are not as bright as pictured  overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight  not too heavy nor too light  it is not itchy  but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right  i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper  but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short  i had to pull them up t
Pretty color  great details  awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck  arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
I love this top (so cute and comfy!)  but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing  especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs  the fabric isn't very soft  and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted  but i wasn't too fond of the dress.
Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
Adore these jeans! great length  cute cuffed details. could do cartwheels in these :)
I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.
I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful  fit is impeccable  no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3" 120 lbs and ordered the small.
Wow  wow  wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person  it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well  and it doesn't fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i don't like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality  very comfortable. fyi  the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person  like an eggplant color. i orde
My local retailer store didn't have this item in stock so i ordered it online. maybe it's my perception of color  but in the photo the top block of color seems to be more of a muted blue/purple while in person the color is navy and the other stripes are far bolder than the muted colors of the photo. i still really like the look overall (even though i usually go for more neutral tones) and it running a little large made the sleeves of the size small long enough for my 5'10'" frame so i may end up k
Nice chunky knit cotton tank with cut-out shoulders. sporty looking. armholes are the right size and bra doesn't show. no holes to see through  even in white. tts. i took my usual medium. falls to about hip bone  approx 20" from shoulder. not tight  not baggy  but has a nice comfortable drape. i got in white. best to put it on before applying makeup. this goes great with black and white print pilazzo pants! love this top.
Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn't as real  almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why  pilcro?? the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the
I purchased these pants in blue  they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.
I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.
Gorgeous  color  fabric  and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"  the length is fine. if you're tall  it might be pretty short for you.
......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however  i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim  5'9" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly  this one went back....
I was so excited to get the dress  it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though  i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.
I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it  so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top  just right along the hem  and then it's a hot  potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
