I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever. i wear it with a tank top underneath so i haven't noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned.   i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear it.  i wish i had it in the blue color too!
Wonderful pencil skirt with subtle design to pair with a variety of tops or sweaters. fabric is nice and has a true 'fitted' design. however  the sizing is all off. it runs small and too long. i'm 5'3 and wait 25/26 in denim and a 2-4p in most skirts. the 4 is too tight and past the knee in length. more like upper calf. the 6 would be way too long. disappointed.
This dress is gorgeous! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping.  i am 5'3.5" and abt 123 lbs. usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite. sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit. i ordered a sz small petite and it's perfect. super soft  great colors  perfect length!! love it!
Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short. 
This is such a beautiful top. i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape. also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust. sadly  returning.
This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering  with or without a belt.  i am 5'2  118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.
I ordered this in size xl. it fits true to size. it does have a boat neckline which runs a little tight on me. but  everything else feels comfortable. i know this isn't a flattering style. horizontal stripes on my plus-sized  pear-shape isn't my favorite. but  i love the back. the knot isn't very comfortable to lean against. i just love the lace in the back that i wear it when running short errands where i don't have to lean back a lot. it does need a tank underneath or it's see-through in the b
I am 5'3" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall  it just doesn't work. also  i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.
Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.
I bought the dress in navy stripe in december and it became a favorite  so i jumped at the opportunity to buy the "blue" (pink/purple/blue/black stripes) when it went on sale. this dress is very flattering and feminine  i love the fitted top  fitted sleeves with a cute button detail  and the asymmetrical hemline. i use the navy for work  whereas the colorful stripey one is fun on the weekends. it washes well and holds shape (i hang it to dry). i like it best with boots  but it would work with fl
This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!  unfortunately  i did have to iron it right out of the bag.
I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big  just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!
I saw the xxs petite in green in my store  adn decided to try this on only becasue it was a petite and in the store. i don't see green as an option nline anymore  so it must have been a old return... it is extremely soft  as others mentioned  and the fit is really flaterring. i bought it then read abou the rebviews  so will see... the fact that i bought the xxs  means it must run big!
Every single time i was in a store  this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however  so when a free shipping offer came up  i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better  but a little snug  so if it shrunk  i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one  it would have been the large; however  they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger  but on a body  it is
If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!
This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty  this is great  but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy  but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra  which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly  so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy  which i liked very muc
I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants  but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.
I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight  and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b
The cut is small. i am 5'9"  150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand.
I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material  wool  is substantial and of good quality. however  on my 5'1"  120lb athletic frame  i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me  but all gone.
Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.     i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs  34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest.
I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color  which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.
Love these vegan leather pants. the fit is great for my petite frame. i bought them in regular size because the petite sold out so fast. i just got them hemmed of course. i love the fit but i also loved the color. the green was a just a little bit different and took me away from the basic black
I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder)  and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!
This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.
The design of this top and colors are amazing! the only complaint i have is that it is quite large. i should have sized down. needless to say i kept it as a summer to fall transition piece!
This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall  a pretty horrible dress. save your money 
Versatile and fun dress. color is better in person than picture. looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments. doesn't wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teeny-tiny for packing!
I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
The regular length i tried on in store definitely didn't work for me. for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40.
This top is so much cuter in person. it's light and airy and very feminine. can be worn casually or dressed up. definitely not as full/baggy as it appears in the photo.
I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful  good quality  and a perfect summer maxi. however  it was way too big. i'm 5'6  118 lbs  i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress  so i choose to get it tailored.
I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes
Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent
The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours)  but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however  they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on  which i liked.
Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl  but in this top i got a large.
Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual  not sloppy. my only complaint  the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans.
This really is a lovely shirt . i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist. i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves. the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors. it is definitely a keeper.
I loved this dress before putting it on  but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all  unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.
I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2" and ordered a petite  but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also  the rise is relatively low. otherwise  the quality is great  and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed.
Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.
I love this dress  i mean it si really pretty in person  however  the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it  and my "older" breasts just droop  not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that  but if you are smaller up there  i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs  26.5 ion waist  30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.    colors and fabric are great  i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad.
This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings  special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!
I ordered it in two colors because of excellent reviews. nice material  but fit is not for me. i will be returning them.
I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size  because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress  and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty  but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners  by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers  buttons or snaps  and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way. i get tons of compliments each time i wear this.
I absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online  but unfortunately  it just didn't fit right. the bust and bodice not designed for curves  and the dress just didn't fit correctly  i think it would work better on very slim figures.
I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny  which in my opinion is in the "runs small" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway  the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top  and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where
This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on  i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline  which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(
I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.
This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.
I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller  slimmer bod
This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular  curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit  just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch  which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric didn't make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt.
I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material  design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall  winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz
Love this henely  the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans
This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it  which is awesome  and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also  the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.
I bought this sweater the minute i saw it  and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order (it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it).   i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it... i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane.   i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later  the sweater had not one  not two  but three differen
I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a "mom jean" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.
This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft  nice shape  unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops  but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up  it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned  but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad.      i love the style.  the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me)     now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the "red" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re
This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
Love this top! with swing/loose tops  i always size down. i'm 5'1"  115  34b  and took a 0. it fit very well  i tried a 2 on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat. so size down if you can! i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it  works well!
I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
Absolutely gorgeous!  words can't describe the beauty of this dress!  i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs).
Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red  and it's a beautiful  vibrant  festive color. i am small-busted  5'3" and 120 lbs  and i got the regular xs  which fit very well  fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite  but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee  and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an
I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments)  while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful  i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it  it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7"  135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially  but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still
The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the "skirt" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl
I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!
I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3)  but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume.  and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!
This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility  it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt   you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it.
This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy  otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.
Fits like a dream: not too tight  not too loose. arm holes aren't too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses)  the sweater material isn't itchy  and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe.
Casual  pretty. runs a little large  especially through the waist  but a great comfortable shirt.
This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size  but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the
This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size  but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.
I typically wear xs or s  or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big  it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.
This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi
Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium  but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online.
This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy  yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent  but with a tank  it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty
I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m
I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store  but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt  which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt  i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit  i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store  how would th
I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail  a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.
I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.
This top is semi fitted and then stretches as you wear it. i love the design and color choices.
The top is adorable  but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.
I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.
I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me  and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts  but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace  however. it is so delicate. no issues  but just be careful!
I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!
I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4" and 160 lbs and tried a small.
This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.
Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over
I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5   and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these
This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.
This jumpsuit is so  so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online  received it  but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out  but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me  it's just as cute as it looks  if not cuter!
I love this shirt! i got the one with the skiiers. for reference  i got a size 2 and i'm 5' 6"  135 pounds. it's a bit tight around my shoulders  but not enough to make me want a size 4. if you have broader shoulders  a 4 would probably be good. the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs. it's too short to really tuck in comfortably. the print is absolutely perfect. the shirt is soft and very flattering. it's pricey but super cute!!
This top is beautiful. soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner. i am usually a 4  but sized up to an 8 to get a little more length. it drapes really nicely. i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual  put-together look or it can be dressed up easily  too. i'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline. it lays perfectly on me. highly recommend.
Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy      the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b
Very versatile skirt that's suitable for any occasion or any season.
The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute.     now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine  the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail.     i wanted to like this  but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c
This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0
I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7" size 10-12 and the large fit just right.
Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small. i returned it.
The review above titled "so disappointed" couldn't have said it any better. the dresses from last year are perfect. i probably wear them at least once a week. i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year. i'm generally an xs or s in dresses (however i have xxs from last year's version)  and the xs in this one is lifeless. it's heavy  hot  doesn't have the same nice shape as last year. i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres
The title says it all. while the quality was good  when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5")  which was ok  but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs  which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!
I thought this dress would make me look washed out  but absolutely doesn't--beautiful pop of color  and unique design. i've received many complements  this one is a keeper.
I hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight. i was afraid it would be to heavy  and add weight. i'm so happy i ordered this one  it'll be a closet staple for me. i love skirts  and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california. i can wear it all year long. right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in  with high heel boots  or heels  later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist  and strappy sandals  or a tank top  and sandals. it goes with
I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift -- both in green  which is really a beautiful dark teal color (as pictured). the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted "an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric." :) the shirt is long enough  loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked  as pictured  but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt. i am usually an xs or an s in tops  and i ordered the s in this one. the larger size gives the slightly loose fit
I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans  had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27  but the waistband was a bit tight  so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off  they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.
I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length  too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.    rolls are not sewn on both ends  so you'll have to re-roll each wash.    wish you carried these basics at all times.
This top feels great on. it just drapes well and isn't clingy. i refused to buy maternity tops  because i wanted to wear the tops after pregnancy. though i bought this top post pregnancy it would have worked great because of the length.
I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m
Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes  the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.
I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!
Wow  that dress is short... at least  the epite was  not falttering on muscular thighs... perhaps a regualr size on that one would work  but the bodice was a perfect fit  so not sure there... i decided not to try it on  as i figured this dress is very seasonal  and trendy. otherwise  if you ahve the money to spare and leaner legs i would recommend it. the cut was actualyl flattering otherwise  i didn't have bunching issues like others  and my 30dd boobs fit in the 0p. color and pattern are prett
First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!)  plus 2" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side  it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one  but know that it is also delicate. after one use  there is a snag on the inside
I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.
Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different. the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side. i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured. for that reason  i'm on the fence about keeping them. i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out.
I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist  and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events  and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.
I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort  it wasn't for me.
I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.
I want to say that i love this fabric design  combining some of my favorite colors -- greens and neutrals. however  this just didn't work for me:  _______  pros:  - it does have a nice flow as others stated.  - pockets are a surprise touch for a silk dress.  - the slip inside is detachable.  _______  cons:  - as another stated  lots of wrinkles. it's the nature of silk unfortunately  which means more work for me.   - length is too short in front for my personal liking. trend of these high-low he
I love  love  love this skirt. it's comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that's a plus!
I agree with another reviewer. the neckline is just right  not too low cut and a normal bra should work fine. also it would be nice if this dress were lined. the top part has more than one layer so that's not an issue  but the skirt doesn't so i'll likely wear spanks. other than that  it's a great maxi and perfect for spring or summer (light weight)..
Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on
This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 34 a 5'6" and 123 lbs.  ordered the 2  my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground  no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t
Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right  not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen  very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.
I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews. i am 5'7" and a size 2-4 usually. 32d. you need to be on the tall side for it to work. definitely will not work if you are petite. i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top. i have that happen with off the shoulder styles. that said  if it works  it is great. i didn't size down went with s) because the xs didn't hang well. it was too short at the shoulders and neckline. again  probably need to be in
This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious  it blends into the shirt
The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so
Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.
I wrote item ran large  but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice  but it does have some issues.
I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store  and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite  32dd  usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit  i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length  but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors  and although the front is polyester  the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting  shorter tops  so i
The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased  but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute  but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.
I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish
Soft  comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt. i'm 5'10"  130...typically wear a 4. the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled. high hem hits me a few inches above the knee  low hem a few inches below.
I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.
Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.
I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it  according to the directions on the tag  it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight  and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store  but in any case  i cannot wear it again.
I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
I wanted to love this dress!! i eyed it for months before deciding to purchase  and when i hit submit  i purchased a size down  given the prior reviews. excitedly  i whiled away the moments until it appeared in my mailbox. as soon as this dress was delivered  i ripped it out of its packaging and ooohed and aaahed over the beautiful lace overlay and the halter cut. hurriedly  i pulled the dress over my head  allowing it to drape over my body. and drape it did  but not in a good way; rather  the d
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
This ia a great casual top...the design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier look...the length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and arm...would like to add that while it is good quality it's still somewhat overpriced for a t -shirt material top  lace accent..
Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design
This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
Like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also  the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly  it's going back!
I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !
This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt  it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy  marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer  requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way  unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally  the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh
I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable  roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather.
The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned  sleeves are quite short  almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt  but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.
This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived  i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however  i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering  it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!
I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up  everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material  v-cut  and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.
I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric  so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7" frame. feels like wearing pajamas  with the benefit of looking put-together!
Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.
First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price.
The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality  i just didn't keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn't look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also.
I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!
Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer. the dress detail is noted as a "swing silhouette" & should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor. the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink. a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect!
This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i
Love this top. ..especially the back. the back makes the whole top.
Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.
I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but  the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.
I'm on the shorter (5''3") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it.
I ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings. i always love my retailer purchases  but this fell a little short. i think it may be the type fabric it is  but the way the back hangs so low on my frame (5'4") it doesn't drape nicely over my leggings. the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans  it would be ok. i returned them both to the store.  this is one that would be better to try on first...
This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.
I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store  tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.
I loved the look of this shirt  but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.
I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.
This is a gorgeous top; however  it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.
I recently wore this to a beach wedding  and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket. the orange color is pretty and vibrant  and it is comfortable to wear. i like the length of it  and it flows really well as you walk. the cons are that it wrinkles really easily; i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles  but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are. as i got back up from sitting down for 10-15 minutes  the front and back were alr
This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on  an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.
I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7"  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it.
This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5" tall  138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread.  it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show
I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends  or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!
I so wanted this skirt to work  love the design! but  it's way  way too long... i am 5  5  116lb  and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"  124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders  and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re
I wanted to love this shirt. it's got a thicker material  a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top. however when i put this on  it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest. i think if the pull was below the chest  it would be much better.
Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
Very soft material  probably will pill quickly but it is super comfortable. it is also very low cut; it works perfectly for me for breastfeeding because each of the front panels can be easily pulled to the side. a cami underneath is required  the model definitely isn't wearing a bra. i'll be wearing a nursing tank under this. definitely a good print for summer.
I received this coat as a 30th birthday present from my mother and i have to say  this is the best present she has ever bought me. the inside of the jacket is the softest sheerling i've felt and is pure bliss to wear around town. the coat is actually a lot warmer then i expected  which i'm not going to complain about. the print is lovely and i appreciate the faux leather edge on the cuffs  giving it a more finished look. the fit is fantastic. i'm a bit curvy and the cinched waist with the belt g
This is an absolutely fabulous skirt. i cant wait to wear it. the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it. i am an artist and have lots of clothing  but haven't created that ab fab combo yet. i will!!!!
The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink  which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine  unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!
I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
This is truly unique top  the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!
I love everything about this top! the fabric  the color  the fit! great top for spring and summer!
I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days  however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl
This dress is so flattering  i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream  so darn cute for summer  in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!
This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.
While this top has a lovely design  neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
I first saw this vest displayed in the window and admired the colors and weave. i couldn't get it out of my mind  so i had to make a special trip back to retailer to buy it. it is soft and drapes well. looks amazing with denim and boots. i think it will be my favorite fall purchase.
It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model  not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue  but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath  but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall  i'm very happy with this  though i'm also very very happy i got thi
I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out  but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person  the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work  but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10" and usually wear size l in retailer)
Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper  trouser-like pant--this is not it!
This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!
Can easily be worn with boots or sandals - multi season dress. comfortable  flattering cut. slightly roomy  but pretty true to size.
I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe  and while the color didn't disappoint  everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin  i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear  but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...
I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
I love the design of this blouse and the pattern  but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :(   it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.
I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly  these didn't work for me though. really wish t
This sweater is beautiful and well made  but i found the cut strange and unflattering. i ordered it in my usual size small  and it was too big in the shoulders and arms  with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms. but it just fit me in the chest  and would be too tight if i sized down. this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual.
I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived  the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me  it is going back.
I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.
I got them in green and the color is very nice. the waist is a little higher than the ag cords  but that only makes them comfortable and holds the tummy in a little good length and the pant holds up nice thru out the day  no sagging yet in the knee and behind area
Good quality  cute and great color as pictured. perfect for leggings or tight ankle pants.
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.
First of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said  it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c
I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!
I am 5'2" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.
Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions.
I *loved* the brown color on the model  and i love the wrap style in general. however  i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7"  137 lbs 32 b)  which fit  but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin  but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me  so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s
I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs  i'd skip this one. however  if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot  perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length  but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t
Runs big  but the fabric is nice and comfortable. i had to return first order and order the next size up. it is short in the front but a nice length in the back. it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique  more brownish orange than red. it will look great with boots!
I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes  it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.
I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses  rompers  short dresses  skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.
This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist
I love the deep v - very flattering. bummed that it's made with polyester  but it's light and easy.
Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!
This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.
I love the colors. however  $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric   no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
Love this dress !!
This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers. what a pleasant surprise. i will shop often!
Beautiful suit. i had been eyeing this one for weeks and finally decided to just buy the darn thing.   it is tiny  just beware. as in it doesn't cover much  especially on the booty. not a bad thing  but buyer beware :) if you are looking for more coverage  size up. i wear a 32d and ordered a medium top. good thing i didn't get a small. i have to get the band taken in a bit  but i need the coverage in the cup.   for the bottoms i also got a medium and usually wear a small or medium in swimwear bo
This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal)  but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.
This dress is beautiful  made with high-quality fabric  unique design and color  etc.  but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal  but i just couldn't make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on  the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long  and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall  s
I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses  with jeans or skirts all year round!
I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders  larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.
I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful  but looked like a sack - returned
Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.
Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)
Although i haven't worn it yet  it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.
The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is  i am currently 33 weeks pregnant  and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now  over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good  but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy  but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely
I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color  but it was just unflattering on me.
My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i"m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.
I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
I have been on the hunt for a black pencil skirt. so i decided to give this one a try based on the previous review. i love it! i didn't size up  went with 0p (26.5 in waist  115lbs  36 ish inches hips). the waist is fitted. the stylist said when she tried it on  it pooched  but i didn't feel that way on me. i had a simple t-shirt on and it looked so cute. the petite length was also perfectly on point. the lace part hit me above the knee  and the lining a little over that - perfect and flattering
Nice fabric  great color  would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves  take a pass--too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up "is she or isn't she" kind of way.
I'm not really sure what the big to-do about the buttons is all about - i was able to slip the blouse on over my head without undoing any of them with no problems. yes the buttons are difficult  but unless you're breastfeeding  they shouldn't be a deal breaker! the blouse is exactly what i was expecting. so pretty  feminine and flattering. also  though it is a tiny bit sheer  i plan to wear it with a nude bra and no cami.
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.
I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.
The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.
Love this! when i first saw it online  i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt. but i finally gave in and ordered it! i'm so glad i did! i've worn it twice in one week so it won't be difficult to get my money's worth! it's very soft and fits perfectly. looks great with jeans or dress pants. i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out.
I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.
This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.
This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.
This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.  i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.  with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side  all this make it to accumulate the "extra" weight on the front of the body and as result "not flattering" for the majority of ladies including me  it is a shame since it has may great features  the style: flowy  low
I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun  and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also  not as comfortable as they looked  the crotch seemed a little "low" on me  though the pants were in the correct size.
This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.    same fabric as my other cloth and stone items  however  i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also  the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way  which i like.
A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.
Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans.
The model pose does not do this dress justice. it is super flattering  and the fabric is a thick light fabric  can't explain it.. the pattern is simply adorable  i can't figure out why this one is on sale while other colors aren't as in my opinion  this is the nicest one.  fits true to size as in my lower range. i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular. petite was too short for me. i went with size 0 and am 5'1.5 and weight about 115.
Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful  the color lovely  the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror  it just was too much material  too big a bell shape. oh well  still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.
So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy  feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.
It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!
These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy  have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big  i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall  highly recommended.
Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.
I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
Great shirt  the material is lightweight without being see through. i didn't find the cut to be all that flattering  but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it. definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet.
This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it  styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!
I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus  its lined  which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress  which i also have  and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe 1 inch longer though  but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for
Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm  just not super soft  but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.
Very old color and item. a little full  but comfortable.
This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat  i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.
I just purchased this adorable  unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it  i knew i had to have it! it is super soft  tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden  i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea
Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.
Since i only wear midi skirts  love the length of this one. the regular medium looks as pictured on me. well made and the dot texture is sweet. bui will be returning as the skirt is literally very heavy and the gathered waist is unflattering on me.
Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.
I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb  heavy and glossy  good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete
Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
This coat is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless. i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality.
Comfortable top. would have been nice to have it a couple inches longer. pretty colors (the floral pattern).
Wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes. i am 5'7"  160lbs  34dddd  and the size large was the correct size.
So i ordered a 0 and p0. when i received them i could tell right away that i'd prefer the 0 and it looked to be the perfect size. then i tried to slip it on over my shoulders...it was tight. it was the right size but it was so hard to get on over my shoulders and then to take it off i needed my husband's help. it fit great otherwise. i loved the feel of the fabric...the design of the bodice. going up a size would not help me as then it would be too large in the bust area...i'm a 32b but i do hav
I purchased this online without seeing in person and was pleasantly surprised. i have purchased clothing made from netting with embroidered damask design in the past and found them to be stiff and scratchy  however  this is soft with some stretch that makes it very comfortable to wear. the fit in person is more form fitting than pictured and is quite flattering. another nice design element is while the shell appears to be see through  there is a built in strapless nude cami attached inside. over
I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.
This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5"  127 pounds and a 30f chest  you never know how a top will fit. however  this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!
I was really hoping this dress would work out  as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice  but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure  but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.
I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however  i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much  but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.
Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.
I ran into retailer to actually return a dress and saw this hanging in the petite section and had to try it. at almost 5'4" i can sometimes go between regular and petite sizing. and thankfully i could grab the petite with this dress. (they didn't have the regular size) it's airy and summery  i love the design of the swing. it's loose  but not tent like. the length came to about 3 inches above my knee. it's not see though at all! i had black bottoms on and you couldn't see them. another plus it tha
This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1  athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room  so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.
I fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it. the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog - the picture of the model walking on the beach. in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isn't going anywhere - for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be re-sewn. some of
So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt.   the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
I love this dress  is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.
At first  i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2''  135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of
I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106  5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!
Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online  however  it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress  highlighting your figure.  i wish this could have worked  however  it felt a little too unshapely.
Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it  my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on
If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front  not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.
So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general  and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it  it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral  material is thick enough for fall  california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite  xs). i say go for it!
I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts  half tucked  and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering  it is a tiny bit sheer  but i was wearing a magenta bra  so perhaps i am biased. overall  i think this is a good basic addition  to a summer wardrobe  can be worn with a nice skirt  or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs  can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs  with 30dd chest.
I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.
This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large  arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
I like what they were going for here  and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back "keyhole" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras  and the very wide neck also shows bra straps  so unless i want to go with a strapless bra  it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without  but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb
Material is too thin and quality is poor
Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute  however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5"4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also  for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back.
This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4  but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
I love this dress but the top runs very small. i am 5'5  102 lbs  small frame and the 0 was tight. 0 is my go to size at retailer. i had to return it. i wish i had bought the 2 now.
This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.
I love the colors of this dress  and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time  but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy  but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model  but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough  and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality  but this one is j
This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!
I love this sweater's rich color and good quality  but the fabric is very thick and heavy  the neck opening is too wide  and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.
I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors  print  cut  everything. i put it on and was so disappointed  the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s)  but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed
This is the best item i have gotten form retailer. the quality is amazing. soft  covers my butt  classic piece!!!
I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.
This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning  the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect.
Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
I wore this sailboat dress with blue wedges to a wedding and received tons of compliments from men  women and children. i love the material  pockets  and flattering cut. definitely iron it beforehand because it wrinkles.
Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.
I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
I have always been a pilcro fan and these are so comfortable and fit well in the legs. i'm 5'6" and 128 and the size 26 fit very well.
This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress  especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash  it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also  it is definitely not a "day dress"--i wore it as a swim coverup  but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and  for lack of a better way to describe it  cheap looking. the white banding around the t
Super cute and flattering shirt  the long tunic-style makes it so you can dress it up or down  so cute and comfy!
I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys  the 27 fits very comfortably.     i"m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.
The print on this is gorgeous  and it's incredibly comfortable. ultimately  i didn't buy it because the length was weird for me (i'm 5'7"); it just looked strange  like it was cutting me off at a weird point.
I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles  but honestly - this is like a dream.
This top is beautifully made and designed. material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out. i just found it not very flattering for me.
It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back. not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat
I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on  it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.
I usually wear small  ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great  just meh  returning it.
Only negative thing is that it sheds. and even that is not really very negative! i would buy it again in a heartbeat.
Ordered this top the second i saw it!  i wear a small or med. depending on the cut and fabric............noticed it is cotton and went with a medium.  so happy i went with the larger size.......runs very small  especially in the chest  and there is no give in the fabric.  stunning top but would go up one  possibly two sizes.
This dress is just what i was looking for. i ordered it in late summer. it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day! it's so comfortable  and just the right length. i wore it with leggings and boots  but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring.
I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice  thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom  just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end  which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs  and the xs was not even
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.
I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine  but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different  but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
Found this dress on the sale rack  but the store did not have my size. fortunately they were able to order & ship it free. the colors & fabric caught my eye right away. it reminds me of a vintage apron print  but in a good way. i'm tall with a long torso & i  had to lower the waist tie.
At the beginning of summer  i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft  open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately  even though these are made of mesh  these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas  new york  new jersey  and florida. i thought they'd be a good  pretty choice. but  the material with the gathered waist & wrists  trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer
I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.
The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.
I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric  like the main photo shown  you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.
So beautiful! i got the xs and it fits tts! it goes with everything! perfect weekend addition!
The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.
I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white  but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!
More importatn  super soft matieral and comfortbale  hwoever  when i put it on  ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric  but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.    true to size  tried on xs  maybe petite would work too.
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.
Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
Oh  i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green  red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10  when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers  i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long  slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style  was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot  but they wer
When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc
This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it  is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion  this dress  with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves  would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length  along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably  i sent it back.
I loved this top when i saw it online  and ordered it right away. however  the fit is way off. i am always a size medium. always. but i was swimming in this and had to return it. even if it had fit  i wasn't thrilled with it. i thought it would be something i could dress up  especially with the lace detail  but instead it looked really frumpy. i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual.
I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it  it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly!
I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale  my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!  it fits beautifully  even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee  and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference  i'm 5'7"  135 pounds  measurements 38-30-38.)  the skirt is substantial  with high-qualit
I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow)  but i didn't. i saw it in the store  thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it  and no surprise  it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small  i have several tla tees in medium  so i tried on a medium and a small. as
I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.
I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.
It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design
My husband bought this for my birthday. i love that it can be dressed up or worn for a more fun occasion.  i'm a tad small up top  so it fits a little too loose up there  but other than that it fits great. i'm considering getting it altered just because i love it so much.
I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!
I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
This is the most beautiful dress i've ever owned. the detail is exquisite. i never write reviews and felt i had to for this dress. i love it!  the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment  though!
The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely  and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer  but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes  i would probably size up.
I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
I love this! i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully. it's comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe. it's a staple piece that i know i'll be able to use for years.
Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.
I am allergic to wool and have a hard time finding winter sweaters. was really excited when i read material content on this item only to be disappointed upon arrival to note that sweater is 10% wool. also found it to be very tight in arm area. for reference i am 5'10"  130 lbs. and would say have slender arms! cute design that will work for some!
This is so close to perfect  but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one. couldn't unsee  didn't buy. very disappointed.
I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.
Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference  i say i am 5' 4" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4"  138-140 lbs.  36c bra. size-wise  i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room.
I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.
This blouse is so beautiful - the collar  sleeves  material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer.    i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"  140lbs and busty...a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material.
Soft knit  perfectly finished  comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer  which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.
This is a great throw in your weekend bag summer dress. it runs a bit large  especially on the top  but i'll make it work. back is a bit low  so a cardigan would be required for office wear.
I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size  and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps  i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before  and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress  and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however  for me  the style makes up for
The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide  but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops  but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium  my normal size.
The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however  the bottoms run so small. for reference  i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start  both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!)  i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly  i'm giving up and returning.   only order this suit if you're super  super tiny on the bottom.
I'm tall with long legs  long arms  and a small chest  and the medium fits me almost perfectly. i love the long sleeves (sleeve length is always a challenge for me) and how the coat accommodates my broad shoulders. my only problem is that the belt wraps around my lower ribs and looks odd. if i can get the belt loops lowered 1.5-2 inches  it will be perfect. if i can't  i'll return it because the coat looks much better with the belt tied if it's buttoned up. one small point: the coat arrived incr
Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft  extremely flattering  and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference  and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple  for sure!
This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus  the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a
I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4  i guess) fit perfectly. sadly  i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale.
The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is  it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better  but i returned it.
I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt  lined  good length...just above the knee  and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up  flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small  but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e
This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle  which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.
This top is adorable  i finally broke down and bought it so happy i did fits good not too long sits at hip were it should (very flattering) i went with the reviews and sized up i am a petite sx normally in retailer but went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i did!it is a bit snug(not tight) in the chest but has stretch to it   i am 5'1 108 33d (if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium ) i got the purple motif (print) no see thru issues the material is a comfortab
I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others  it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.
Love these jeans however they get a little saggy in the front while wearing which i don't like :/
This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one
Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.
This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo (i'm 5 ft  ordered petite) but the length actually works. i have a bit of a tummy  so ordered size 4 - fits great. really love the colors - so many tops will go with this skirt  so it will be easy to vary the look.
I ordered this on sale  after reading the review  but i was disappointed when i tried it on. the color is darker in person  which is better for me  but it looked dull on my skin tone (pale). also  teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck. the overall cut is almost flattering  a little long still for me in petite  i felt like i was trying on a regular size. so not for me. for reference  i ordered the 0p (or xsp  not sure right now). i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5
I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.
This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.
It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.
This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great  love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.
I love the cold shoulder trend  and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue  which is really more like a very light mint green. however  i think the material is pretty thin (though soft)  and the keyhole sleeve area  right by the twist  is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small  but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds  32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price  thou
I tried this shirt and really loved the feel  and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery  and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me  but i'm between m&l  and sized down  so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!
I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.
I really like this shirt. it runs somewhat big but i love the oversized effect as seen on the model. i normally wear a m in shirts and the s was spot on. the only quality issue is with the buttons..they are a bit flimsy when you unbutton them. other than that  this is a great shirt and the price with the promo is just right.
I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute  edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!
I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!
Even following the care label exactly  it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
Love love love this tunic. it has panels that don't really show up in the picture but the panels make it lay really nice. it's great over leggings and skinny jean cords. could even wear it with opaque tights. it's great for work  play or evening. i bought the navy blue with the heart print. i love it so much i'll probably get the green and the red when they go on sale. this is a pricey top. for reference i'm 5"3 128lbs. 32ddd fits great all the way around and the length is perfect - mid-thigh an
Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring  summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1" 115 lb
I bought this dress in store today in a size 4  i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress  there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
I ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them "wine  side zip pants." they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back  even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.
This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
I loved the lace detailing all over this dress and the fact it had pockets and was mostly cotton. it just looked so inviting  so i grabbed two sizes to try on (10 & 12) that 99% of the time fit me with retailer clothes. here are my thoughts: __________ pros: - lace detailing is lovely all over. - everything runs tts except at the bust (see below). - breathable fabric  comfortable. _________ cons: - i'm a 36c and could not button the top two buttons of this dress in a size 10 (i'm 5'9  hourglass  a
I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12  although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi
This is the perfect day dress--loose fit  comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type  but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller.
I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit  light enough for the beach. they have my size finally! i'm a regular 12 and m worked well for me. can't wait to wear these with a nice top.
I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.
I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it  tried it on  sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first  it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"  140 lbs.). the size was good  but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally  and most importantly  it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l  5'8" 175lbs  am busty. very nice fabric  prone to wrinkles.
I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
Love this vest!. it does run large so definitely size down. i'm 5'0  110 lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think that's the style as the shoulders hit where they should. it is such a fun and unique piece. i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots.
I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all  it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.
I'm not sure what cup size i am  36b or 36c  but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public  but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops  but the medium worked for those too.
Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.
Very cute print! love the mix of the colors on this sweater. looks great with jeans!! throw it on over a tshirt and you are set.
Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing  and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also  really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an
I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
I can't stop rubbing the faux fur. faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful. it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top  above my bust. its roomy so size down if you want it fitted. i'm 5'1" and 120 with a 34 c bust and a short torso and i got a small. i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight. the hood is the best part. it's so drama
Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty  but the shape isn't flattering  at least not to me. might work better on a teen?
I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy  oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu
I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves  so current. unfortunately  it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small  and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair  so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!    i am keeping it because i love the style  but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.  i got the x-small and am a 3
This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.
I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!
I love this dress. the pattern/print is very different than most of the dresses i own. i'm 5'1" 106lbs and the 0p fit perfectly. it's a delicate dress. its very fitted in the skirt portion. the top is more of a knit fabric that has some give to it.
This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.
Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like "gumby the cartoon character"
Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.
Comfy and lightweight - beautiful blue color. sleeves are a bit long but not a bother to me.
The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs  the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally  this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas  and the waist tie ties way higher than
I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan  but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it  and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.
The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely  and in general  it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price  very disappointed.
These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise. other than that  they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting. i'm 5'6" 107lb got a size 25 and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isn't too big just not constricting. i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it 100% plus the length is perfect
The dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath. it was just too big for me even as a swing dress.
I was so excited to buy it online  but it come in a small plastic bag  and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got  so i had to return it
Its a beautiful print and design. the shirt overall is a little short but untucked it can work. i dont know why everybody is making these short square little tops. overall  i am intrigued with the whimsical print and i like that enough to overlook the length.
I wanted so badly to love this dress  but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated  and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though  the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning  but alas will be returning.
Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package  i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show  a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6"  135 lbs  and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l  thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking  maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl
I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty  but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.
The look is frest  crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!
This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!
As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top  the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece.
Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front  but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft  but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look  but sadly this is going back.
Very soft  cute design  great over leggings!
I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.
I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.
Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it's a 10
I was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on. the small was huge (im 5'8  130lbs)  the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body  making it feel tight/stretched against my shoulders. i love the print and style  and would have bought it if it was $100 less. however  at the current price  it needs to fit perfectly  which sadly it did not.
Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.
This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely  rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit  but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"  140  straight athletic build  size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.  i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store  i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!
It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
Based on the photos  i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline  fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering  but the fabric is thin and clingy  making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was
I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a "petite" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th
I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight
This top came down to my hip bones  but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for "regular" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice  and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing  i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model  but n
The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to
This is a very cute shirt with great details. however  it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.
Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.
This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea
Love the buttons because i am currently nursing my 5 month old. easy access. i'm a 32dd 5'9 147 and it fits fine in the top. got a size 4... love how it flows over my pear shaped hips. i thought it was a sunflower print but actually moths! haha very cute. wish i would have waited and got the sale price... bought my it in may for mother's day!
This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
Not usually one for a turtleneck  even a mock turtleneck  but this so soft and did not fit super tight around the neck so i bought it. then i bought the other one because i loved it so much. my only gripe is that i wish it was a smidge longer. i am 5'5"  135lbs  curvy/athletic build  34c and the small fit perfect.
I love this dress! would like to see one.september make it in sky like their meda lace top. runs a little big. i normally wear a l but the m fit perfectly.
This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.
It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine  but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.
I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.
I bought the ivory sweater. lovely color and softness. the zipper is a great  unique feature that i love. the bottom has a wavy shape with extra fabric - definitely creates a bell shape.
Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.
I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.
Very comfy and easily could dress down or up!
I saw that there was metallic detail when i ordered it  but i wasn't prepared for the entire thing to be metallic. it fit tts  but wasn't what i was looking for.
Love love love this dress! quality and fabric are terrific  design is a little 50s throwback! fits well and flatters the body!
So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.
Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.
This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders  which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great  modest and cute swimsuit.
My only wish is that the front waistband were more high-waisted  but other than that  the pants are darling--flattering  vintage yet on-trend and made with high quality fabric and tailoring. i am 5'2" 125 pounds and i bought a size 4. they are a perfect fit.
I'm in love with this dress! i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i haven't seen a body that it doesn't look good on. i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didn't at all. this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet  i highly recommend it!
This dress is beautiful. it has lovely colors that should compliment many skin types. i bought the dress for my daughter as a graduation gift. i have not given it to her yet so i don't know if it fits or how it fits.
This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
Love the top design  not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium  sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8"  athletic  150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!
I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2"  34b  tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on  it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store 
I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
I was on the fence about ordering my normal med  but so glad i did. it fits sooo well. i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin. its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels. i don't like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath. this was a great buy especially with the sale.
The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price  i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing  so i am debating whether i should keep or return.
So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.
This is very cute in person. i love the colors  a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine  with the ruffles  but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me  i would have to wear with higher rise pants  or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy  so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list  didn't get it yet ...though the day it showed up at my loca
I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!
Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!
Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.
Love this dress! the neckline is gorgeous
This is a very comfortable shirt    great basic to have in the wardrobe    it runs a little high on the sides
Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it's a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it's lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there's the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it's lined. although it's so cropped  i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that's longer.
I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.
I am usually a small sometimes medium. purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy. it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me.  confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool.  i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy
I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.
This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple  black  stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it  but just not flattering. i am 5'2" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm "curvy" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat  just not for me.
This sweater just arrived in my mailbox and it's already my favorite piece of clothing. it is the softest thing i own... and it feels so luxe. as the reviewer below noted: yes  it has pockets. they are slit-style pockets (probably why you can't see them in the photo) and the opening is trimmed with the same cable detail featured on the front of the sweater.  i'm also a professor... but i still get mistaken for a grad student so i don't mind appearing "professorial." i'll probably wear this to th
Love love this dress! i got the regular size  but the length is more on the petite side. it's shorter than what i'm comfortable with  so will probably return it.
This is such a unique and beautiful top. it will be a go-to in my closet all year round. the red embroidery is amazing. meant to be a loose fit. i'm 5'7" and 120 lbs and ordered the xs. fits perfectly.
I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!
I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
This top is really pretty  however i found it to be super small. i know meadow rue tends to run small  but this small was like an extra small. i'm not large chested either . if you are super straight/thin with a long torso this is the top for you.
This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick  it is soft  and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my
I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute  having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings  seaside strolls  chilly restaurants  or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
Ordered the xsp (5'4" about 118-120#  athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes  too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back  not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks..
I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i'll still need to return this top.
I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3"  120 lbs. 34b  and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut  not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade  with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea
Some of the reviews about this being cheap fabric made me nervous about purchasing...but i did and i love it! the material isn't super thick but i like that as i tend to run hot. it's super soft material and feels good on!!
I didn't know what to put for "runs small  true to size  or runs large " but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl  and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time  i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large  based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad  for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you  go for
I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.
I wanted to like this romper  it is very cute and colorful  but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.
I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft  comfortable fabric  as other reviewers have mentioned  and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace  nothing sharp  pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.
If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it  as it's not terrible  but worth noting. that said  its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.
The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
I ordered a pair online  they came today and i am in love! the fit is great  i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom  i am a tad short (5'3") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase.
This is a great top. soft and cozy fabric  nice and sturdy feeling. it's heavier than i though it'd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring  and even a chilly summer night. i love that it's long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings. the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug  however  i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt. the best part... it can be cleaned in the washer and drier! thrilled with this purchase!
So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small   but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!
I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing  the length is great (i'm 5'5" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee)  and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron.
The print is unique and fun. however  the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.
They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.
I got this dress in neutral motif. looks very cute and the size is perfect.
This is a very nice top  but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size  and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft  the colors are nice.
I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing! super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates  yoga  playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls.
I love these jeans ~ the are so soft  so comfortable  nice fabric weight...not too heavy or stiff at all  very flattering  best of all they move with you  but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day ~ i am on retailer site now to purchase another color~
I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though  i love many of retailer shorts  these are one of my favorites.
I have many left of center tees  and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color)  which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long  the cotton is thick  and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me  though  because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me  though.
I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going  but it was not  it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference  i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me  not "cool" long like some other sweaters this season.
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.
Can be a bit itchy sometimes  i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!
I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5"  130 pounds  usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model  but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.
Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.
I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that  it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo  it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7" and 145lbs with 36" 30" 40" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful
Very figure flattering!! i am 5'6" 128 lbs 32b chest and size xs is perfect
It's a t-shirt. a very cute print  nice cut  very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore  why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it  but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.    for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer  and the medium fit well.
This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big. this went back  will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp.
This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i can't wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin  and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also  it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7"). other than that  i love this dress.
I wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no  i didn't buy too small  and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
Love these pants. they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose t-shirt. i usually wear a size 26 or 27 but went with a 27 on these. they are very flattering and edgy. love them!
I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall  which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso  the xsmall was better  but looked overall too short  as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9"  however the model is supposed to be 5'10".
I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
I love this tee. it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft. it runs small  especially in the arms. i suggest sizing up. the tee looks great on. it is slimming and super comfortable.
I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy  but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments  i can't see anything. in fact  that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required  so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds  5'4"  34b  28 waist  40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it  but the salesperson suggested i try
This is a great top. i love how it's loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isn't shapeless. the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personality.  i usually bounce between a s or xs. i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s.
Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(
These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.
I thought these would be nice  and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also  the jewels make the jeans feel heavier.   fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans  slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer  as not only am i short  but i have short legs for my shortness!)    so if you want that styl
I'm 5' 5"  150 lbs  32dd  normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast.
I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy  which is nice - in my experience  it is not too constraining  contrary to other reviews. however  i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note  it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.
Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge    does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me    extra small is like a medium    not a sky color   like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath    better for taller larger sized people
Fun and elegant!  this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials  as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.  it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece  which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear
I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m
This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print  but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on  however  i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin  young girls  but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats  the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore
1. i'm 5'5" tall  145 lbs  and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath  when zipped up. i plan on wearing tank tops or thin t-shirts under it  and leaving it unzipped. i'm normally a size 10  but at retailer  i'm a 12 in their jackets.    2. thin with a thin lining  but stiff enough to hold its shape. the front zipper also helps give firmness to the front edge.    3. the fabric is white with lots of beige embroidery and lace holes.    4. i have a feeling thi
The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique  especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"  135lbs  34c and the small is perfect.
1. i'm 5'5" tall  143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32 -40 and the medium fit me well.    2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand  where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.
I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
Love these crops. fitted through hips with full legs. at 5'7 and 125  the 27 fit perfect. these look great with block heels and wedges. denim is lightweight  perfect for fall.
Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me  and was not flattering.
I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!
Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name.
I just got this shirt the other day  and already love it. it fits like a basic tee  but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom  which makes this really comfortable.  my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back  but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too  so the quality feels nice.
This dress is perfection! very flattering and pretty.
This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.
This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!
These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!
I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful  however  the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  so i ordered the size s  there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs  i will have the same problem.  below the bust  the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms  and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket  but it's just too sloppy.
I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame  but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!
I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black  army green  and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.
This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said  it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference  i actually love the fit and thought it was tts  though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a
Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan
These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants  definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.
I sized up to my higher size choice and it was snug. not for athletic builds. top was fitted and thighs tight which caused the belly area to pouf out. good for very thin gals. also good if you are long waisted.
This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style  not meant to be tight to form.  that said  the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2  145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.
I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body  however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.
I absolutely love this. i'm 115  5'6" and the xs is roomy because of the style  but it drapes very nicely and it's a perfect fit. with my new loafers and cropped pants  i'm all ready for fall! he slightly felted knit is a nice touch. it's also really soft.
I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as "runs large" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo
This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top  slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size  though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.
I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic  she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top  but if you stand upright  it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m
Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look  but still nice enough to wear to work.
I love this dress. wearing it is the equivalent as wearing your coziest t-shirt. there is stretch up top if your chest needs it  the neckline is modest  the stripes and geometric pattern are flattering and vibrant  but not gaudy in the slightest. the length is perfect with the shortest part at my knee. silhouette is tight at the natural waist and flares out in the most flowy and flattering way. i got the large. i am 5'7" and fluctuate between 170 -185 lbs.
This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can
I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however  i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater  it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice  but it was large around the torso  yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
I ordered this top in my normal size medium  and it was very large. i am 160 lbs  36b  size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty  that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight  but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck  but i am small on top  so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!
This is a lovely dress with a soft fabric that drapes over the body. the pattern is soft and feminine  very much like the picture. my only issue  which is why i didn't give it 5 stars for my overall rating  is it's a bit snug around the bodice. this could be because i'm a lifelong swimmer however  my bra size is 34 b or c depending  so this shouldn't be an issue for this dress.    other stats: 5'7" 117 lbs and i got this in an extra small per recommendations of other reviewers. the small would b
This top is unique and beautiful but the fit does not work for me. i am tall with broad shoulders. the shoulder and upper arm areas are too tight  but the rest of the top is loose and flowy  so if i go up a size it will be too wide. the length and arms are also much shorter on me than pictured. i don't see this in the description but it comes with a cream colored cami layer  and the sleeves have a roll/button tab function. the brand is meadow rue. this will be really pretty on someone more petit
I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute  but missed the mark.
This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag  with only a quick ironing. unfortunately  the first time i washed it (cold water  hang dry)  it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy  is much shorter  and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately  after i had purchased and washed!)  i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only  because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
Tried both colors....gorgeous  but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is. [the black color will also need a cami -- strong sunlight or a camera flash will be revealing.] a lovely layering piece under sweaters  vests  jackets. so pleased!
This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.
I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me.   i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.
Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
Very nicely made sweater which fits well. i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase. the small fit me perfectly (34d) can't wait to wear it this fall!
Great dress  love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel. the dress is well made  too!!
This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.
The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however  the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.
I wanted a casual  denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4  117lbs and the xs fits me true to size  hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .
I love the color and the cut! it fits well and i have a large bust. hangs very pretty.
First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.
I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality  worth the money!
I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish  modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored  conservative  and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs  i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is "blah"  average.  the material is textures and crinkly  not slick. the top is cream/ivory color
When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well  and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable  but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
This is a very lovely t-shirt  because of the color and design. it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across. it's perfect for leaving it untucked. the petite fits really well  no too long or too short! my only complaint is the the material  while really soft is also quite thin so i'm not sure how durable it is.
I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length  which does not work with my mama belly.
I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering
I'm so glad i tried this dress on to see how lovely it is. definitely a keeper!
I really like the style of this top  and it's delicate but well made  but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer  but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length  and ordered the xxs petite. also  you would have to cut the tag off if you d
I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.
This top comes in 4 lovely colors  too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone (purple)  though i might have gotten away with the silvery grey. fit: nice falttering line  flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist  so if you ahve a problem area  nice coverage. feel: super soft - nuff said ;-) versatility: i am not sure it will look great with everything on my body type  but definitly a nice pair of jeans (flare or skinny with boots) a and may try the pencil skirt look like the
This dress looks great with bright color  but size runs small.
Crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around. the waist section  where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didn't lay well. i am 5'4"  120 lbs  32c  26" waist  and 32" hip usually wear a 0 or extra small in the maeve clothing that isn't a fitted style. i bought the s  which fit well except for the waist issue described above. this is a fitted dress. i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received. it is a great style idea.
Beautiful dress  wonderful fabric  very well made  just runs really small! so sad  i wanted this dress for a special event!
Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that 1 front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it's the "retailer unique touch". i don't mind abt that. it's too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really didn't need another itchy swtr  so returned. no worry  retailer has plenty of other items of interest!
Great style and quality. however sizing runs smaller than anticipated.  i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me.
Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.
I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5"4 and ordered a small petite. not too short  but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!
The design of this dress is darling and so unique  and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3" and ordered the 2  and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that  but this one's going back. shame  too  because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut  but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high.
Beautiful dress  but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.
I wanted to love this dress  and i don't. it is soft  it is flattering on the model  and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back  causing the drape along the bottom to look odd  and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband  but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again  very often.
I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn't fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty!
Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress  i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
I purchased this blouse in black. love it. this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail. it is perfect! my only wish is that it came in a colors. i would add navy  red  green  white. i'm tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out. buy it - you won't be sorry.
I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
This skirt is a show piece! the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering for different body types. i got my usual size  even though i have a smaller waist and larger hips and thighs. the skirt looks cute with the split-back buttondown by cloth and stone. you will not regret buying this piece!
This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.
I love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes...
I really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red  size
This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!
I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different  awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy  athletic build  with broad shoulders and small waist  for your reference.
The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans  and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky  but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in  or out and about for casual outings.
Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.
The small  zipped and laid flat  measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes  11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0  and not by just a little! too bad  because it really is very pretty.
After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool  i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine  and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer  rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved  high waist is flattering. regardi
Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small  32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.
The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality  but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!
I love this top  wish they had it in more colors  i would buy more!
Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.
Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated. my husband loves them on me. for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer. i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t.
These are nice and light weight and comfortable
I wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.
Superb quality and design. i am a 34d and 120lbs. i am a size 6 to 8 but mostly 8 due to my hips and top. i am pear shaped and 5'6. the dress was a little loose but i just need to get it a little fitted but you can hardly tell. i love the floral patterned so intricate. it truly looks like a princess dress. it is little heavy and at least it's not too tight for dancing.
Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit  flattering silhouette  comfortable fabric  shape enhancing cut  and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3" 140# 36dd
I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately  xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee  but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable  hte weird part is the fabric  the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
I thought this top was so pretty and airy  but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
This is a beautiful skirt. i wanted to make sure that i received a size that fit so i ordered two different sizes (pxs and ps). i typically wear a pxs but since the description mentions a side zip and it looked as if the skirt was to fit higher on the waist i thought i should also try a size up. as i mentioned it is lovely. light airy. i just wanted something easy to throw on and look put together with flat sandals and a tank for the hot weather that is coming and for an upcoming vacation to the
I had just bleached my hair really blonde and was in the mood for something pink  so when i saw the rose color of this sweater in the store it fit the bill. nice and easy to wear  a wee bit scratchy but not too bad.
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue  which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss.
I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small  but returned and exchanged for a medium  which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
1. i'm 5'6" tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.  2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size.  3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.
This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but  the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though  because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p  am 5'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect  the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i
This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.
When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6  5'8" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!
This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.  i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.  i need to return it!!
I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it  but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on  i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!
I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.  it is a pretty heavy  nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9" frame.   but - it is not white  it is beige  and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back  even though it was a great buy on sale.
I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.
These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.
I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves  which are fine  but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side  but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan 
Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red  but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit  flirty  flattering  very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned  the fabric is a bit heavy for summer  but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment  no biggie  i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering  chest area not too snug  and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs  26.5 in
Nice quality  but enough material for two sets of tights. can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look.
This top looks exactly as pictured  it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8''  128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.
Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure  and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
I was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit  it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet  as the weather is still very warm  but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft  i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing  i hope this is just an overlooked pos
This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering  yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper didn't work well. it just wouldn't zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?  the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it  so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.
After trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4") and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone.
This is so beautiful! i loved it online  but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!
This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal  but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit  the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made  but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews  and it's too large  and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick  (5'5  105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips  making me look a little curvier  which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing  and this piece will spruce up most outfits !
Usually wear a small  sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small  if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws  so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great  medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.
I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely  but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned  this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well  i also didn't love the collar  which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po
My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still  a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!
I love these jeans! i am always reluctant to change brands  but these are the best! i was pleased from the minute i took them out of the package. the fit is perfect: very skinny  but not too tight! they retain their shape over several wearings  too. the color is a great dark navy. looking forward to a long relationship with these! it's love!
I'm 5'7"  135 lbs  slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.
I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that
I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same  not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted  generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom  peplum"ish" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish  118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day
Love this skirt - it looks precisely as the photo depicts. the metallic stitching may be a little bothersome for some in terms of itching/scratching. i&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; 135# and the 6 fit perfectly (pear/hourglass).
Such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery. it's very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately. i ordered the 6p because the 8p was sold out and although the top fits quite well  its just too snug on the hips. if the 8p was available i would definitely exchange it for that.
I don't usually have the best luck with pants from retailer but something made me try these on. i am so glad i did! i love the fit and the fabric  they are so soft and comfortable.. i loved them so much that i bought an additional pair of the grey wanted the turquoise but they were sold out of my size so i settled on the sand... i will definitely try other styles of the pilcro.
I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos  and have purchased many pairs. however  the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved  although they have the exact same name. they are now "boy cut"  and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say "boy cut". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri
This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks  lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me  tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.
Bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you.
Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great
I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small  i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length  short but not too short.
I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8"  180lbs  36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!
This sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also  there are no bra-straps holders  and my bra straps did show up a lot...
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
First off  the moment i put on  i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall  xs was a good alternative to medium petite.
This shirt is soft  long and is the perfect pair for leggings. i am only 5 ft. tall so this is extra long on me in the front and back! i bought it in 3 colors and hope to get more. i bought a large and love how it covers/hides my trouble areas!
The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.
Picked this up end of season sale  but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto
5'7 145# (athletic) 34c. as info  got my usual m and this is everything the previous reviewers have said. the sleeves run long  a bit bunchy at the wrists & cuffing makes them look normal length . maybe it could be just the one i've received & i know its a tie waist  but when i move it opens as if the body is a tad small. it does fit like the photo but opens with ordinary movement. pull it tighter & double-knot it you say? it only reinforced my belief that i needed to size up. i re-ordered in a
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out  however  its not. its soft  comfortable  stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.
I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa
Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable  fits well (slightly large to size  but i prefer that)  and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.
This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
Great jeans  great cut  great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26.
Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice  and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush  and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress  will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work  with heels for evening. oop  my usual size  fits perfectly (5'4  110 lbs).
This cardigan is very soft and feminine. it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere. i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room. if you don't mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater.
I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer 5 years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size  i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store  but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm  perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft  so soft  not bulky at all. if this is your s
Gorgeous fun dress  but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra  but i think its a winner for someone.
But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)  probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires "truth in sizing"
It's not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.
I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!
I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall  great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals  which look like sequence online are high quality  as is the fabric and craftsmanship.  a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!  you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!  ordered my usual size and fits perfect.
I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.
I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.
This shirt is really cute. it's shorter than most - and it's supposed to be that way. if you don't want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt isn't for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it's different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5" and 120 lbs.
I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles  this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge  ordered an xxsp  the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said  "that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan
I saw this dress online this morning  went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest  but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts  and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest  and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!
I love this top.the only thing negative is how thin and cheap the material feels.
The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise   the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.  the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy  and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5'7 and 115 lbs  and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit  but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short  but i didn't feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the
This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size  typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed  small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on. too bad  but it went back
My v-shape figure (broad shoulder  narrow hips  waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.
Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return  sadly.
Great quality and cut! they are so versatile  which i love! highly recommend these!
I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items  this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day  she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach.
I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea  but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on. ---------- these fit tts  and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me. ---------- as an aside  these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss
I ordered this when i first saw it on line but it was backordered. it just arrived today and i am so very happy with it. so feminine  kind of vintage yet modern. the epitome of the retailer aesthetic. i typically wear a 0p ( 32 a -26-35: 5 ft 2 in) in tracy reese and the 0p is perfect. i gave a 4 for quality only because it is polyester  (however that also keeps the price down). it seems that every summer plenty by tracy reese comes out with a dress that becomes my go -to favorite and this year is
Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!
This is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it (delicate  cold water  line dry) it shrunk excessively in length. i'm very disappointed.
This tank is very loose fitting  which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps  i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling  which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.
I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh
This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7"  and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.
Love the style  weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed
I love the overall look and feel of the dress. my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and i'm not tall. i ordered a small and i'm 5"4 130 lbs bottom heavy. the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well; however  i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise.
I've been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size 2. i'm typically a 2 or 4 in dresses and the 2 fits perfect. for reference i'm 5'6  34c  130lb. i think it runs on a larger size because it's a shift dress. i would recommend sizing down. a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner!
This shirt is purportedly made of silk  but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.
Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends  vacations  and just to be adorable in!
These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top  but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.
Ordered this as a gift.  she said it is great!  nice fabric  great fit.
Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!
I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many "bandage" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
This is a gorgeous dress. i got the red version. it's stunning...the zipper is trash however. i'm scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer.
This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.
I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars)  this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.
Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.
While the cut  drape  and shape of this dress are very attractive  seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however  the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly  thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.
The first time i wore it  felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax  shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.
This is such a darling velvet dress. understated  yet eye catching  i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder  but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.  i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and can't wait to wear it!
These are perfect for pulling off a finished look  proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial  lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!
Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!
Bought this as "transitional" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting.
I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
I bought this top when i was 6 months pregnant and wore it the rest of the pregnancy. i am 5'4  34d and 135 lbs. i got all the way up to 172lbs and a chest size of 36dd. now that i'm not pregnant...i don't think it flatters my "new figure" anymore. ha! but i seriously wore it all the time when i was pregnant...so gotta give it at least 4 stars.
I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.
Was very disappointed with this dress. it's very baggy  no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :(
I love hd paris styles & this jumpsuit appealed to me online so i ordered a 6p. i am usually a 4 or 6 in regular sizes at retailer. i decided the regular size may be too long & too much fabric for me. i am 5'3"  118#  36c. it was easy to slip into it  zip up the back & tie the black ribbon in the back. it doesn't say in the 'details' that it has a built-in bra which is a good feature. the bra cups are a little small on me but not a deal-breaker. the length is fine falling just above my ankles. i j
I'm really pleased with this jumpsuit. it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. the navy is lovely. i'm normally a medium or size 4-6. i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy  especially on top. i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted (as worn by the model) and the pants were still long enough. i'm glad i didn't give up on it.
I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it  but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.
The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size.
I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live
I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the "orange" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure
The tank is very structured  thick yet breathable  not see through. the coral is much brighter in person  and the white is more like a light cream color. the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because it's such an unusual color. size regular xs is fitted on me (not too tight  not too loose  but over the course of the day  it stretches a little) and the hem falls at the upper hip (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big. the knit a
I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store  and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material  lined  and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet  i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale  i'll order a small  to see if it is more flattering. but at this point  it's a no-go.
Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it! (as a side note  it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
But the back of it  by the waist  bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger  it will be too long. but i love the skirt  it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured  just below the knee in front. the waist is snug  bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs  26-27 in waist  short legs...)
Retailer  take me away! this dress transports me to an island. i ordered a small and exchanged for an xs  i could have probably even done an xxs (thank you vanity sizing). i'm not tiny. i'm 5'4'' and 130lbs with lots of baby left overs.   i love the details of the dress and so many people stopped me to compliment it. and  while a few people thought i was pregnant while wearing this dress (because women obviously only wear flowy dresses when they're pregnant)  i welcomed the seat offers with wide o
I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality  but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it
I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big  hangs just right  arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans  shorts  or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh  slimming too!
I knew i would love this dress  it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves  these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but  the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4  or s/m this was a small. will return. if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.
I first saw these in store  but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be!
I was expecting a lot more  but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose  just too loose  as it runs very very large i returned it
Beautiful dress  just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.
This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.
This top is adorable on. the online picture doesn't do it justice. a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on. i got it in xs - black. i am 5'2" and 115 lbs. it has the perfect drape to it. it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little. this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months. love it.
This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.
As other reviewers have said  this shirt runs a little short and wide. i usually wear petite  so the length didn't bother me. the sleeves fit me perfectly (which is rare in regular sizing)  so others may find that they are too short and tight. to fix the boxiness issue  i just stitched 2 of the seams in the back together to give it more shape. since i bought the black pattern  my diy fix isn't too obvious but this may not work for the other colors. it needed a little work  but it was worth it fo
I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me  this dress fit terribly. however  the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3" and about 117 with a really short torso  and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller  or maybe with a longer torso  i could see this dress being really lovely.
I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too  very reasonable. i want one in every color.
But like other reviewers said  it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3" and 110 lbs  i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material  it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this  but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed  because the material is beautiful and i lo
I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version  but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.
Gorgeous fabric. love the crochet back of top & cut out sides of bottoms. runs small. i'm 34a - small top fit. 26-36 - medium bottoms fit.
Like a previous reviewer  i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots  so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops  however with a 34d chest (5'5" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t
Dress is very flattering on  not tent-like at all!
This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles  it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!
I like the feel and color of this blouse. however  i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse  it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the "curve" is not even visible when i wear it.
I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made  a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they haven't stretched out...highly recommend.
I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.
I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.
This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.
Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!
This is all around  a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least)  but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs  but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.
This multi-season dress fits beautifully  the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight  drape and swing to it. the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but it's probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer.
Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!
I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink. the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso  so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s)  it covered my flat hips  fits just like the picture  but now my hips are showing :( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
This dress is beautiful on  is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy  it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer  but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.
I just love these! i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size 28. they fit just right  just like my other pilcro jeans. i'm only 5' and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but that's typical. i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good  not over-the-top. i'm so glad i got these! and the sale price was a bonus!
This dress is very pretty colorwise  but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips  but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
I went into the store to look at a few certain items. this wasn't one of them but it really caught my eye. i got it in yellow. it is such a great sweater. tts
These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.
This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft  comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.  i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!
I bought this dress for my sister's bridal shower  and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual  but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!
I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.
This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online. when i went to a store  though  the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy  and i wanted to give it a chance. i tried it on and it fit like a glow! i am a 5'1''  100 pounds  and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit. the length was great for me (petite size) and did not need altering. the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress. definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a
I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.  on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4  112 lbs  bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store.
Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7"  127  and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase.
Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.
Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small  but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5"5  135 lbs  with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well  slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom  with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress  it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky  so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet.
These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.
I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me.
I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
I love this t-shirt  i feel classy  stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted  it is bellowy in the peplum  but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!
Love it! as a previous reviewer stated  you can actually wear it reversible. so happy i purchased it!
I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.  it runs quite large  in my opinion. i'm 5'7" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light)  but i don't think this is a problem  necessarily. had it been thicker  it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip
Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months  and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length  i feel a great length when you're only 5'1  will look great wi
I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5"4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.
This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
The shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.
I love the feel and quality of these pants  however  they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist  unfortunately.
I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.
This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful  but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs  and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.
The top fits nice  but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.
I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!
This skirt is stretchy and really comfortable. i love the color. the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly- on me at least. very flattering for the behind though.
I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however  i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it  the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch  but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it  so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this  i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.
Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8"). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to
This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside  while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy  but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest  and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front  so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4  140  34b  and i got a small petite  because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh
I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously  i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!
I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.
This dress is to die for. it's exactly as pictured  beautiful quality and extremely flattering. all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress - i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun. but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress.
I ordered the xl in the green motif. the shirt is fitted through the body. i'm a pear-shape so it's tight around my hips. it's cut straight down. i'll need to wear this tucked in or belt it/pull it up a bit closer to my waistline so it's more comfortable. the colors & pattern in the green motif are prettier in person. i love orange roses & haven't found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it. i used my birthday discount to splurge on this. i think it's over-priced for what it i
This is a beautiful dress. the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture  and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful. the waist is very fitted but it didn't feel uncomfortable. i didn't think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned. i do think it is a bit short on the front (it is a high low dress)  but at 5'4" that is not a problem for me. it was true to size for me (135 lbs  34c).
This is definitely a cute top! i am 5'1" 34a  and bought the extra small. it fits well  very flowy. a little shorter than i like  but it still looks cute. it's thin  but soft and comfortable. i wore it just like the model  with my long jeans and some wedge sandals and it looks great for a spring day!
I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s
Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did  there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot  the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem  since the shirt can be tucked but i will have
I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture  the sleeves are a bit long  however i am 5'2.5 and 107 lbs  i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!
I know it's for warm weather  but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6  because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me  but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.
I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.
First  i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering  forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it  and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together
Sizing is just getting unreasonable  and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model  but on my 5' 4" 115 lb frame  the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally  the shirt looked like it shrunk in length  and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i
I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background  with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does "really pop " and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . .
Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase  especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.
I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.
Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"  150lbs  size 12 is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale.
I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one. unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
This came in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size  so i ordered a s & m. i tried on the small first and it fit perfect. i never tried on the medium. fyi  i'm 5'5"  125 lbs.  & 34a in the chest. this jacket is a keeper.  it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.
I really love this top. it looks so sweet and beautiful and is perfect for dressing up a pair of jeans. if you are on the short size it may be a little long so keep that in mind. i love it!
The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a "statement sweater". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference  i am 5'9"  150 lbs.  34dddd  and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and  with my height  i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks.
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
I tried this on in the store  and the fabric is lovely - so  so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric  so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.
I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
This top looks beautiful online. when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back
This dress is amazing! i have to say when i picked it up to try it on i thought it would just be an ok dress but i thought might as well try it on. to my surprise it was more than perfect! the waste cinches in when it is zip it up and the blousing in the chest fits lovely.
I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.
Although the weather is getting warm in ca  the gold color and cut of this shirt made me want to buy just one more long sleeved item--and it didn't disappoint! i'm actually looking forward to next winter so i can wear it again!
I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice  but the very first time i put it on  it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem  except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o
I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it.    i will be returning this.
I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though  because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that wasn't the case this time around. i'm 5'4" 130-135lbs  depending on my appetite!
I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits  but for the sale price  i can overlook this.
I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.
If you know the meghan trainor song (and who doesn't?)  you'll know what i mean! i could tell by the photos online that this skirt would enhance curves  and i am fine with that. however  it is very snug in the rear. i can honestly say i had made it to my 40s without ever once wondering or worrying  "does my butt look big in this?"--that is  until i tried on this skirt. however  i chose to keep it since we were going to hawaii soon  and i decided it would be fine as a casual skirt and cover-up. i
I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist  but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin  and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference  i am 5'-7" 155lbs  usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large.
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
This dress is really beautiful  cheerful  the color lovely  the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style  fabric  and color. i am 5' 5" with long legs and a shorter upper body  so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size  but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely
This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.
They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
I got this dress today. i was super excited and hoped to use it. it runs so  so small. i'm returning and ordering up.
This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said "wow that's very elegant". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality
When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.
I've had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale  i picked up both colors. they fit me like they do the model  a little loose and swingy  but not overly so. the colors look spot-on like the picture. i am rather top heavy  (34dd) but with the colors being darker on the top portion  i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much. i am 5'4 and weigh 149  the medium worked out great. the knit is soft and it appears to be made well. the only drawback is a rough
This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7"  165 lbs  34c  and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:  the bad: when i tried it on  i found the bust to be too small  and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also  the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.  the good: the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl
I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!
Cute top  i actually got a lot of compliments on it.  the white is slightly see through  which doesn't bother me but could bother other people. all around cute casual piece.
This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little "off". would have loved to find the ivory in my size.
Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size  which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure  but so cute! fabric is super  super soft. i want to wear these all day long.
Perfect for the change in weather  this sweater is very thick and a tad big. i would say it is true to size  but if you're like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear  don't. there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome. the color is a bit different than that shown; it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined. just a note  the pin does not come with the sweater; the closeup made me think it did  but it really doesn't matter. the color
I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.
Very comfortable to sleep in. doesn't bunch up or twist. love this.
I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy  yet unshapely. after the initial wear  the product begins to stretch out  and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft  but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely  but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
Don't get me wrong  this is probably cute on someone else  but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed  it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this  size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.
Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..
I am 5' 10" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run
The print and fabric are great  but this dress has odd construction  or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway  i'm 5-5  weigh 125-130  36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo  but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped  but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress  i think a medium would make the top too big  so i
Bells out to much i had to send it back
I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.    the birds of paradise are just lovely  not exactly the same on every suit  but still nice. i just
Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4"  105 lbs and generally consider myself proportioned  but curvy on the bottom  and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams  but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable  forgiving  and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps  because at the ti
I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans  but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.
This dress is so pretty  a true cinderella dress  that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics  but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14  which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand)  the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
Well first off i knew a jumpsuit was going to be a gamble for me- i have a long torso at 6 feet   but i just loved the print and the style and typically all things sactuary so i was willing to risk it. sadly the torso length was an issue and it seemed to run small to me-i ordered a small which usually would fit fine  but ended up pulling across my hips and with the patten being what it is... well on me it just wasn't flattering or comfortable.
I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.
This skirt is super cute and versatile. dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater  tights  and boots. i'd say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side; definitely doesn't run small. love it!
I'm a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so  i ordered this in a small  and the top was a little loose  but it was way too short. there's no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i'm 5'7"  and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape.
I love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly  too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am 5'4" and a size 2  and the 26 fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build  rather than curvy.
These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing  these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.
Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering  feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top  6/8 on bottom.
I just recently received this dress in the mail. i went up a size to a 10  i am usually a 6 or 8. it fit perfectly. the top is very fitted and the bottom flows nicely. i really like this dress and am looking forward to wearing it to work or out.
It's like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it. very sad to return this.
I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out  not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it  i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short  it fits well.
I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy.
I almost ordered this dress yesterday online but did not. i went into my local retailer today and they had it in stock. tried it and completely fell in love with it and even my retailer lady in the back was amazed! i am 5"5"  115lbs. and went with the xs petite. excellent price point.  gorgeous in "neutral"....  tts  highly recommend!
I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor
What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif.  no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned  for reference i'm 5'2" 107 lbs average proportions.
I hesitated initially buying this because of the unique fit in the neckline and shoulders and because i have broad shoulders. but if you adjust the neck  sleeves and play with the overall fit of the shirt  it works. the boxy airy design has to be paired with something that flows with it (i.e. linen pants) or trusty denim. otherwise you may have a battle on your hands finding a complementary pairing!
I liked the top  it is cute  but i didn't keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options. however:  color: it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top  but that is not necessairly a bad thing  it kind of gives t personality.  lace part (this is where i have a similr one  tank all alce like that): darker ivory  drkest part of hte shirt. cut to neck is flatetering  and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of.  body: true to size  i
This sweater is a great  comfy fall or winter sweater. in several of the pictures the neck is folded down  so beware that the neck has a bit of a turtleneck/mock neck look to it. it can be folded down if that's not the look you're going for. cute sweater!
I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute  the "swing" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops  but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent.
I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
I love this shirt  bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short  it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!
I recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big  lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a "short" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so  it's not as "loose" on the inside as you would think. this "short" is not a bad thing...but  it's something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon...
I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful  and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous  but this one fits tts.     my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.
Haven't seen a top as fun and unique as this without being "too much" in a long time. i typically like a little longer with skinny jeans/leggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind. it's the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out (not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo)  the "bell" at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties. the color is beautiful and i
This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.
While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.
This skirt was cute on  but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically  a-lines are flattering on my figure  but this was a miss.
Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days  while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.
I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
Loved these pants when i bought them but was not expecting them to "grow" a size within an hour of putting them on. i think it's an issue with pilcro. great styling  nice fabric  but buy one size down!
This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!
Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!
I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.
This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.
This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans!! soft  sexy (without being skintight) and the perfect color of blue!! i am 5'3"/108 lbs and the 25 was a perfect fit!! these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing (think legs that look a mile long!!) with booties one night and nude heels the next!
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy  just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
I am petite  5'2  and i ordered the xxsp  i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large  it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.
I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!
Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas  so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect  since the colors aren't look too summery  but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy  but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops  this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.
The neutral color was at my local retailer  which is a rich brown/mocha  much nicer looking in person. like others  this is quite sheer and thin. however  it is so stretchy  breathable  and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead. for my 5'9"  36c  hourglass frame  i found the medium to be rather body hugging. it was not at all loose like on the model. for me  this is fine because i will layer  eliminating issues of sheerness.
This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and  it's extremely comfortable!
This runs way big  i'm a size 8  purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.
The perfect pair. i am 5'6". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long  it can go nicely with leggings and boots.    material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite.
I like the style and the design of this culottes  but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface. i had a few loose loops for just one wear... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping   but not good to go to the park or play with kids...
This is so retailer - pretty in pink  unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink  and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips  just like shown on the model). the top has structure  not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms  like me. this top has everything: flair  bright color  unique print  but al
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length  it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color  it's just as pictured. like someone else said  you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!
I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing
I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
I wore this dress to a baby shower. it fit nicely and i received many compliments. i liked the weight  it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet.
Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.
Purchased this today at my local retailer-been eyeing it a while-thinking i would wait until on sale-until the salesgirl whom i know said it was their second shipment and all have sold out. knew i needed to splurge. i tried on the small and x small and wound up going for the small. i did however try on 3 smalls and two of them were way to roomy  but the third one fit like a charm-it was quite a bit slimmer in body than the two smalls  strange but true. i do have room in it-i am a 32 c to 36 b and
I loved this blouse  but had to return. i am 5'2"  127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy  which is fine  but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material  it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.
Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.
Didn't like at all. itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl.
Fun   flirty  feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.
Tried on this maxi dress recently  hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.
This dress looks simple  but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool  saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.
I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place  which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off  immediately. i tried them on again a second time  still hopeful  with the same outcome. sadly  returning.
I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material  but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau
Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.
Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4  112 lbs  broad shoulders  athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large  but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed  i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.
This wrap is awesome. soft material  perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!)  and warm  great for layering.
For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size  i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.
I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"  115lbs i prefe
Very cute jumpsuit  especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3  115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!
I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however  when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror  i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning  they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3"# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh!     i thought perhaps it was my perception that day  so i waited an
Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact 
They are really cute. the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice. the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down. i bought 27 p my usual size and sent them back for a 26 p because the waist was big.
This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.
I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
The cotton  the print  and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful  i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a "puff" to them that i don't notice on the model  and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else  it's nearly empire on me. and  there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig
I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however  when i received it  its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally  i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2  30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted  but its definitely not.
I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut  length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.
Very nice design and color (beige). however  i am 5'1"  118# (athletic# and i thought the petite small was a bit too short #even for this cut) and just a bit too tight in the upper arms when wearing over a light-weight long sleeve dress. may work well over sleeveless. will see if a regular small fits better  but then the sleeves will be too long and not easily hemmed like the petite sleeves can be. the fabric is a bit felty for a boiled wool  but not a deal breaker.
With the pleats  probably need to tuck in shirt. these were too big for me  so need to return.
I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
Well...this is "on me" as i saw this hanging in the store  but way off on my size which is xxs petite.    i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.    both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no "flow " just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.    this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes
I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress  twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print  i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s  with tights and boots  but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders  so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not
I have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often. however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all.
Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.
I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.
With a skirt so vibrant  it's hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store  following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (i'm 5'4  slender build)  the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i don't necessarily mind a shorter length  but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep  but the quality of the material justifies it. the one
I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on  good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me.
I tried this on in-store. it is super cute! i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasn't sure it was completely worth the price. if you are in-between sizes  take the larger size.
Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.
This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top  felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .
This top is comfortable and flattering. i really like the simplicity- a wearable basic summer top  with a cute twist  just enough to make it contemporary  but not overstated.
I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but  this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored  but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.    now  the fabric is stiff. and  it's sheer. but  the pockets land where your breasts are. so  i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however  if this is for work  i'd put a cami under
For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.
I tried this skirt on in a size medium. i am usually a small (4-6  39 inches around the hips and butt) but there were no size smalls. the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose. the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined! overall  the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it. the only thing i might say is that is is quite long--closer to my ankles and i'm just shy of 5' 9" and leggy to boot (i wear a 33" inseam with flats). with tall boots on  you saw j
I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately  the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size  i am 5'4"  130 and ordered the 6.
I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.
I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.
I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color  and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus  it's cream  not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size  but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it's great for wedding guests  cocktail hours  or even work.
This dress is absolutely beautiful! i love the colors and design however there are two issues with the dress for my body style: 1. it's not made for busty girls. i'm a 34d/dd and the small would have fit well (i'm 5' 6"  147 lbs.) but my chest did not fit. so i tried the medium but then the overall fit was worse  which led to another issue: 2. the waist and pleating made me look a little heavy because i still have a small amount of baby weight/spare tire around my waist  which was highlighted wi
My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric  i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders  so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins  beads and rosettes decorating the bodice.
I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it  hoping that it'll fit me.     i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper.     i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress  i don't mind it.
This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim  & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms  and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light  but i love in so cal  so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies  heeled clogs  and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4  140lb  34b  and the 8 fits perfectly.
This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large  but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
The shape was not as nice on model  seemed like a lot of extra material.
This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy  with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover  and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)  the first time i wore this top  i paired it with denim shorts  and the hemline completely covered the shorts  so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover  i'd just go with yoga shorts benea
Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust  this fit nicely and moves well  it's not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale  but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i don't regret getting it at full price.
I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me  but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front  back  or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap  and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d
There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
I'm a short girl  but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me  i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad  which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still  it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.
This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings  boyfriend jeans  and flare jeans. be careful  it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great  but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows  shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully  it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.
I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!
This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling  which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone)
I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front "collar" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.
I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body  it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way.
It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.
This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!
I am about 5'6"  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight
Very cute top  just as pictured  nice soft material  color is bright and true to size. wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments. highly recommend!
I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it  however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever  though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me  and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky  which it does mention. maybe a little expensive  but i did use a coupon.
I'm 5"1  115 and bought the small. i buy most retailer tops in xs but the small fit well - not too tight and is flattering. the colors are as seen and are a soft muted color. the material is thin which is fine for hot weather and i haven't washed so can't say how colors will hold and how well material will hold but have high expectations for retailer apparel. this will work well to wear with shorts or a navy maxi skirt. adds a nice touch of color for spring and summer.
Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos  the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit  i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"  128# with a very small
This is a perfect jacket over any shirt  tee  or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!
I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail  i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape  material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.
I had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit. i'm normally a 10-12  preferably a petite. i ordered this in a large and i couldn't begin to zip it up. it also ran extremely short in the crotch area. very pretty print but it's going back!
Just to back up what everyone else is saying  this poncho is perfect. it is indeed super soft! casual and fun. i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured. this poncho is not tight around the neck  yet not lose. it goes right over your head without messing up your hair. i love the sleeves. they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it. a great alternative to a sweater. i ordered the petite xs/s and i'm 5'3. hits right at bum.
I somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons. it looks fine on  i'm just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath (why i got it). otherwise  just as pictured. i'm 5'7" 125 lbs and got an xs.
This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow  but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine  especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric  but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally  the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!
Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.
I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie  this item was too small  especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful  but unfortunately  i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.
I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant  it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.
This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite  but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute  and versatile dress that
This dress is a great color  fabric  and the style is very flattering! i'm wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall! dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church!
No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.
Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric  this is a great special occasion dress.
I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i couldn't wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket  light sweater  wedges  then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.
I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.
I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!
Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket.  the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall.  runs tts.
This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!
I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.
This bunches up too much  and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it  it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top  i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.
I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well  no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.
Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.
Cute  cool dress for hot summer days. very roomy. has pockets!
This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric  it's very boxy  & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(
Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on  the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.
I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.
I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust  had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose  but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering  especially for those of us with an athletic build.
These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year  machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer  bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...
I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small  but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large  so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.
I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!
I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.
I thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that  the dress is as it appears.
My main complaint  is that the button holes are too tight for such delicate buttons. one button shattered when i tried to get it undone  and what's even more crazy  is that mine did not come with any extras. so i guess i'll have to go to the fabric store to find a match. (i'll be sure to get a bunch just in case) a couple of minor notes; it smells like chemicals  and i won't be able to wear a bra  because the chest is a tad tight. however  the dress is cute enough  that i'll deem it worthy to we
So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
Great fir and very flattering. keep in mind that it's a little low cut. some bras may not be low enough or may show.
I ordered this top in the pretty  sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that  which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline  i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e
This dress is awesome! love everything about it  except the colors! the pink is ridiculous  it is like pepto on crack  there's no way  outside of being a bridesmaid  i would ever wear that shade of pink. nauseating. i would order the turquoise  but i don't think i want that either. plus the pink was the only color offered in the store  even though i saw the dress offered in black online at one time. why wouldn't you stock the black in-store???? i can no longer get it.    you need to offer this d
I purchased this top in the black and tan color  loved the fit  style and fabric. however  it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front  which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
The dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable. i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest. it's a good basic to have on your closet  but i ended up returning the one i bought. it didn't feel special enough to keep.
Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long  not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!
Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print! it does run a size small if you ask me. the size 10 i got fits more like an 8. the corduroy belt really sets the waist off.
I agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large. i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however  the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely. i'm 5'8" but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress. the dress is a very dark forest green (not black). see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that  due to the material  it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t
I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen  but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.    at first glance  i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy  single layer of unlined  unstructured fabric  to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt  i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch.
I tried it on and it fit like a glove. it was a little strange having a different fabric on the back  but it worked and i am keeping it.
This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.
I love this sweater  it is well-made  the colors are great  adn the feel is very soft. i just love troubadour  never knew of it before this season but already own a few pirces. i tried on the blue version  fits true to size  i don't hink i need the petite. the nexl ;ine was more falttering than the pcture shows. i love hte sleeves too. i think overall the shirt is a bit of flared out style  which i love.
Loved the material  but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5" and there was atleast 5" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans
Very high quality dress. there are two layers  (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight  making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.
I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy  sleeves way too long  etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line  you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
Received this and love the style  but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso.
I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky  loose fitting  professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.
Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.
I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on  the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.   if you have a tiny head and pencil a
Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.
I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little "throw on" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger  i may have bought it just for lounging  but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me  but cute for teens and early 20's.
Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3").
This is the best! i have the black and striped version and wear them weekly. great layering piece and also for fitting so they look great with skinny jeans. i love the snaps. i saw this at full price but waited for the sale so that i could get more than one!!! now i just need the gray one...
This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!
I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it  which can be true for a lot of "swing" dresses as some give off that "baby bump" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short  even for us at just over 5 feet tall.     when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels  it falls perfectly and
I ordered these with high hopes. i have 2 other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore. i was disappointed. the fabric isn't soft as i expected. the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band  but this might be due to folding while packaged. i tried these on several times - wanting to like them but just couldn't. i am returning them. the colors are beautiful - especially the bands on the bottom. they seem made well. it might just be that i am between sizes. i am 5'4"  115. i tri
I really wanted to like this shirt  but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.
I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit  very thick  rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky  the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2"  34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long  way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size  may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
The shorts are very cute  very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1"  115 lbs. they are going back.
Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only  but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2  32c  107 lb and the xs petite fit very well  definitely form-fitting  not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look  actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest  and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.     the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.     the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a "1920s circus diaper" look which is not good.     they're also really tight compar
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.
I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"  it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.  also  it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.  too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking.
It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.  i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite  i'd try it.  it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
This shirt is true to size. it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable. it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner.
I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big  it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
Hi there    if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft  a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better)  and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans  and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized  but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so  if you are ti
Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso  this would work great. if not  unfortunately  its not great - tear
This top is really pretty. it's a very strong embroidered lace all over (front and back) with small holes. but  the description states there is a polyester lining  and this is unlined! so there are holes. but  i do not think this is immodest and needs a cami. just wear a nude bra under it. the holes are not revealing at all.    the sizing is tts  and is as shown in the photo. i bought an xl because if a top isn't stretchy i need to wear a 16 or 18. this fits me  only it's not as loose in the bac
This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10"  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it 
I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.
Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large  however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok  but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist  but  alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!
I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on  it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
I bought this top in black  and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me  but this top is definitely a great length.
Very soft and comfortable  great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large  but not drastically. for reference  i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.
I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.
The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.
I love these pants! best fitting pants i've ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don't stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn't plan well and stock enough. i bought the black  want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants  i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity.
I ordered this dress  expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large  except in the bust which fit well.
Tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems - 1. not made for c cup bra women or larger and 2. the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest  so when you see yourself at a profile view  there's these ruffles that look like they're coming out of your chest. just sayin'. not for me.
I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference  it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so  i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo
I'm not in love with this  but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s  and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b  26 inch waist  120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso  and i realize the design is for it to be flowy  as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model  which is
I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price  they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim  pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right  and the tag sewn inside  was sewn with red thread and showed through  very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
These are some of the cutest jeans i've seen in a while. i ordered my usual size 28 and they were too big. i'm 5'9" and about 140 lbs. i always were a 28! i reordered the 27  though  and they fit perfectly. the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach  which isn't the case in other jeans. i think it's due to the high waist. they fit almost like a pair of pants. oh well  i'm keeping them. i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable.
I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
I ordered the green and lilac. the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option. i found that it ran true to size  but was a loose fit. the lilac color had white streaks from the the-dyed effect  but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on. for now  i am keeping the green one  but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model. i do like that it is 100 percent cotton and very so
The fabric is very nice on this wrap  but it wears like a blanket.
Great coastal sweater. color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral. the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up. i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans.
When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal. however  that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas  not very flattering  so back it goes.
I love this top- it's loose and flowy  yet flattering  and the colors are fun. the armholes are cut a little low  so a cami is necessary. after one wash and lay flat dry  the wrinkling is substantial. hope i can steam it back to its normal shape.
I tried the red version at store  it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual.
Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(
I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine  just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...
Tried this lovely with high waste  wide leg  black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more  but not quite!    size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small  occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5" tall  130 lbs  34d  35-29-37  long torso  narrow shoulders  and short arms.    fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t
Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.
The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit  they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.
This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!
My stylist didn't love them... they are well made  the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty. the hem is loose-fitting  perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering... the material is airy  nice for summer  i think you should give these a try    for me  perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate.
Imo this top does run small. arms were tight in the size xs and just a bit snug in the s. top is definitely versatile. i don't usually wear peplum tops due a larger chest (34d-dd) and they usually look like maternity tops on me  however this one did not. the problem with this top is the fabric in the back of the top is shearer than i'd like. you can see every bulge and bump of your bra. i felt you'd need to cover your back with either long hair  jacket  vest or cardigan. not a deal breaker becau
As with many of retailer's tops these days  there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well  though. the white color is cream  which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body  order down a size!
I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
This dress is lovely fabric  generaly nicely tailored  but weirdly large around armholes  which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.   dress was generally a a bit too big on top  oddly both too long in the torso  and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12  fairly busty but not extremely  and with a slightly short torso  which is party the problem (th
Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i'm usually a 10  but still a little snug.
Very pretty blouse with nice detail. needs to be worn with a camisole however.
These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand  mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever  i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
This was a really nice  soft lightweight sweater  perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem  it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price  but the color was really pretty and on sale  i would def. go for it. for reference  i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.
This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!
I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans  black loafers (or boots)  and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#  34d  5'4" and the s fit well.
The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
Material is hard to wear a bra under it
I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and "idea" of dress (looks stunning on model)  but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly  has to be returned.
Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!
Contrary to the first review  i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow  like on the model  but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.
Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.
Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this.
This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips  and the dress (size m for 140 lbs  5'8") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric  like other reviewers - honestly  even if there were a snag or two  the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible  depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f
I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9  140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected  making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed  as the color and concept were great.
This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :)
I purchased a petite size which fit great except for the slip. the slip is at least 2 inches shorter than dress. super comfy and flattering! perfect for fall with at pair of booties.
Cute dress. i say true to size - but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly. it's lined so there is no need for a slip. very comfortable and cool. i am 5'6" and it is 3" above knee. i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only 1/2 over!  a great priced dress which holds true to retailer's quality and uniqueness of items offered.
I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately  it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and  it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly  it is going back.
It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
The red is so pretty in-person. i love the details on the sleeves... only complaint is the fit is pretty boxy and couldn't size down because it is borderline to short in length. did buy it today and we will see if it work out!!
I own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material. this one missed the mark. not soft and very thick. not what i was expecting.
I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them  but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!
These shorts are perfect. not too short  but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my "hyphen" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose  order true to size. they do stretch at the waist  so if you want them to fit true to size  order one-two sizes down.
I have mixed feelings about htis top  it is a nice shape and comfortable  fits triue t o size  but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs  3-dd chest).
This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(
The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big  it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics  not sure if it is because it's new.
The design and workmanship of this dress are outstanding. the fit may be tricky for some. i am small busted and the bust and even the neckline are very tight and fitted. still flattering  though. i typically wear a 0 or 2 in dresses and purchased this in a 2. i could have worn a 4. 5'8 127lbs. the length is perfect as i purchased this in navy for a wedding. the navy cami slip underneath is top quality with adjustable straps and snaps to hold them in place at your shoulder. overall a sweet and dr
I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it  but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color  but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy  still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom  wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered. they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on!
Bought this shirt in mid-july  washed twice (cold  delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart
I love the print and design  the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist  and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top  the colors are vibrant and shiny  totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits.
My normal size 32 fit tts. the length is great (i'm 5'9). i love the button detail on the bottom  makes them a little unique.
This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing  even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high  it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely  not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6
This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size  and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.
These pants overall are very comfortable  but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short  and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter  so if you have long legs or like more draping  you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh  a bit puffy  i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality  and cute design.
These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans  but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.
I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back "x" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an "x" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.
I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily  newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice  classic fit in the front  i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied  it keeps everything together and is very comf
This dress is beautiful in person  the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses  but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room  but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part  it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we
This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!
This wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings. the rise is higher and the fit is larger/bulkier through the waist and hips. i love pilcro legging jeans  so the fit difference is kind of disappointing. i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size. i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own.
This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches  it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style  not trendy so it wi
There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...
I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer  but will never again buy another sweater here.
I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine  whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short  as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh
This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it's really stretchy fabric too. i'm a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted  so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.  the other thing that's nice is that for short people like me (i"m between 5'2" and 5'3") it doesn't drag on the ground; in fact it fits me
I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!
I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.
Great turtleneck  very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.
Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt. i highly recommend it!
I really like this dress. it does not bother me that it is not lined. i feel very feminine wearing it. i plan to get a shrug to wear with it.
Like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose  billowy  and perhaps
Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.
I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer  i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!
Great dress  can be styled up or down for more casual look. it ran a bit large for me  especially up top; the armholes were droopy unfortunately. i ordered the s but returned  the xs will hopefully be better. for reference  i'm usually a s  5'5" 127lb.
I can't wait to wear this but it has been to hot in the south.you can wear this so many ways.the material is wonderful  and the pattern better in person.
This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down  as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!
This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!
This is my second jacket from this brand cartonnier and i am thoroughly pleased.     i love the quality and texture of the fabric of this coat. i think the styling is super classic with a little bohemian edge.     i am 5' 3" and 120 lbs and the size 4 fit me perfectly.
Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas  my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top  but the way it cuts  you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me  but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.    i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p
I fell in love with this dress online  but it just doesn't look as nice in person. first of all  it's huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this  and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however  after seeing it in person  i didn't love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit.
This top us flowy  breathable  and feminine. the fabric is light so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric. it is sheer so a cami underneath is best. with flowers  less structured tops  i size down to a small or 6. some other tops i'd go to medium or 8.
This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for
This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.
Oh boy...i didn't get this one  and it runs small. too bad.
I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.
This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs  which i nesrly always wear  but i measure 35" in the bust and it fits well  but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value.
This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item  and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10  ordered a medium
Was really looking forward to this sweater  but it's not a cardigan  it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made  and extremely soft  but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as "batwings." that should have been depicted in one of the photos.
This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.   as for sizing  i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine  although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue
Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also  i found the fit flattering at the hips  following my hourglass shape withou
The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.
Sits slightly below waist  i bought size 30p  length is good no alteration required for petite height 5'4 and 136lb. material is good and i recommend them.
Love these pants  and will wear them all season like a uniform. but  the quality is a little low. made in china  and the black dye may be coming off on white clothes and my skin. i haven't washed them yet  and a little scared to. super comfy  stretchy and still classy despite the quality issues.
I like this comfy top. i bought it to wear with a cute pair of gold charlie cropped pants i bought from retailer last fall. the only thing i don't like is the odd length of the sleeves. they are somewhere between elbow and 3/4. i am a true xxsp in most tops  but the sleeves end right at my elbow making it difficult to wear them unrolled. for reference i am 5'1" and 107 lbs. a larger size would have been too wide and roomy. overall  i am happy with my purchase.
I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe  but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me  it completely irradiates my shape  including my neck. this will be returned.
These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly  and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!
This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am  it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.
I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
Reviews said it ran small so i ordered a size up  was large on me. nicely made  but wanted something a little smaller.
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!
Nice color and great work but runs little large.
I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work  cocktails  and once  two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters
Pros--this dress is so super soft and warm...i feel like i'm just wearing a winter throw when i have it on.  cons--way  way too big. i returned the small  which easily should have been a large (with room to spare) and got the extra small...it's still way too big. they definitely have this dress clipped behind her back so it doesn't look so huge and there's a reason there isn't a video showing how this dress looks when it moves...because it is ginormous and they know it!  but i still kept the xs
Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best  tight in the hips  extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric  skip.
I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone  with leggings  or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.
I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
This top looks adorable in the product photos  so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off  but like another reviewer said  i found it to be like a tent on me  billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress  but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"  120 lbs and tried the xs.
Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3  117 lbs  34 b cup  and took an xs. top fits comfortably  no tightness around the chest  and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through  so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet  so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!
Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love  love!!
This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!
I got an xs in this suit.  i am 5'1  100#  a32.  this was much much too small.  it was very tight around the chest and i am only a 32a.  it is  however  a good looking suit.  i suggest sizing up.
I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because  while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso  it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.
These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p  but they were sold out in the gray color  so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big  at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.
Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side  which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater  buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white  which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt  for the "sweater dress" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket.
My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it  and the little  fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green ) and the double stripe jacquard skirt  but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable  with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
The fabric is beautiful  a bit sheer  but overall lovely. however  the sizing is really off. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14  and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very  very nipped right under the bust. so  if you have no bustline and a super small waist  this top is for you. if you are like me  high waist and straight up and down  this is a pass. in fact  it is really h
Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin  lightweight  and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..
I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.
This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.
Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good
Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs  but i am glad i chose this one. first  the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier  which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and  the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.
These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.
I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine  but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips  so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.
The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch  the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.
I love the colors in this top  but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.
I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.
I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!
The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings  as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable  which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too  since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain.
It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.
I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi
The top is really cute  but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy  i didn't like the fabric  and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.
I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion  it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits  so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color  there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction  so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging
I wasn't sure about this dress  and decided to give it a shot based on reviews  could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length  and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest  but none of that is an issue.
I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.
I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model  it's a little bit frumpy  but it was so pretty that i tried it. however  on my short frame  it's even frumpier. the quality is very good  the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"  110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p  but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a
The most amazingly versatile cardi you'll ever own! it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt. it's soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars! definitely worth the price.
The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.
This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed  except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5"  122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else  but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also  it is quite low cut  so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason
The look  quality  and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny.
This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer. the fit is great. i'm 5'8" and 145. i ordered the small and it's perfect.
This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist  feminine hips.
I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs  and 4 was the smallest size available  so i ordered it. when i opened it  it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.
This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.
I'm between a s & m.  on most swing tops usually s which i thought i'd be in this one but not the case. a m fit but i thought i could probably even wear a l which i never wear. but it is gorgeous. this is one of those shirts that keep me coming back to retailer. this is a perfect fall top! great tan color the beading is so so pretty and will really look great under sweaters. this top looked so great with my louis vuitton bag it was just too good to pass up so go to your local store  find th
I am usually between a s/m.  bought it in the small and glad i did.  the blouse is billowy.  had some trouble at first getting the top to stay "off the shoulder" because it raises up when you raise your arms (obviously).  stretched out just enough and is now comfortable.  the black lace design at the bottom is different and pretty.
Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.
Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.  perfect dress for fall.
First of all  this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute  but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit  i am 5'6"  123lbs. 27 inch waist  32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned  the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my
Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"  about 130 lbs  and the medium fits well. it is long in the back  but i like that. if the front were a little longer  i'd prefer that  but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing  very appropriate for this holiday season.
I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i wouldn't spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesn't make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!
This is a soft  light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry  which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect.
Love love love! i'm 5'8"  122 lbs  34b  and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses)  but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms  showing about 2" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y
I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs  though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute  the cut is just very strange.     for reference  the black and white is the small  the taupe is the xxs.
The fit  once you get it on is as flattering as can be. its beautiful quality is undeniable. the problem and it's a big one...you can't get it on without destroying your nails. the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone. 'dear designer  you forgot the zipper. sincerely  women everywhere'. i loved it so much but just couldn't buy an outfit that was going to take me 20 minutes to put on and since it is a jumper it would be a process throughout wearing
What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h
This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.
The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality  but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape.
I really like the soft  flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs  the s was too large  so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets  elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides  slip underneath  and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
This is truly a beautiful dress! the delicate fringe-like fabric throughout makes it unique and and the column silhouette with slight blouse-like top is elegant! perfect for summer with comfortable stretchy slip that comes with the dress! the material on the waist line stretches and is very comfortable. the bottom is pretty narrow so you need to take smaller steps. it does run large  i am 5'3"/135lbs/34b and an xs fit perfect throughout as well as the length! only not so positive feature is how
This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality  and they've always said i could bring it back)
This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price  but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest  but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest  so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
I am 5'7  115 lbs  and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect  and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great  but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom  but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head  but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price.
I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles  even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.
These pants are elegant and chic. great for tall women. wearing to a yacht cruise  can't wait! would have loved to wait for the sale  but i had to have them and i am very pleased.
This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy  the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0" and ordered a petite small. probably returning.
I loved this coat in the picture  and couldn't wait to get it. sadly  it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable  with gorgeous embroidered detailing  but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio  i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist  the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened.
I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldn't believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine wasn't available but because of lace and side zip  it still doesn't look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange  but i couldn't leave the dress behind.
I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos  so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7"  130  straight/slender build)  so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit  size down. either way  get this!!!!
I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite  one 00. the style  color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall  however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall  160lb  i usually wear size l 8/10  but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves  i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it  there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno  nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short  and i'm 5'1". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist  or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it
This product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey. props on the draping though  that was lovely.
I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy  and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd)  so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews
I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it  it is too hot to wear in the summer  putting a tee under ruins the look.  i am very flat chested so it hung well  but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.
I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh  & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29  as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please  or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale  i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"  117#  slender legs  skinnys are either
I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress  too cute!
This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft! looks great with booties and flats! can be paired with so much! jackets  scarfs  long necklaces! so glad i bought it! i did down size to a small from my usual medium! and got the regular instead of petite! fit great
I love the design and color of this cardigan  and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately  it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"  105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties  as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring  but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel
I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.
I absolutely love this dress. i bought this right before traveling to italy for vacation. it was perfect for the hot weather  flows nicely and was comfortable for a whole day walking around. i am usually a small  but this just felt to loose on my chest. i went with an xs.
....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad  sad  sack. the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me.
Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.
Great fit  the fabric is supple and of good quality; has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable. can't beat that!
I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them.   im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight.     the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.
This sweater is so cute and seems high quality. i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste  going down just below my mid section. i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it.
I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful  bright colors; tried it on  and it was becoming  comfortable  and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago  have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.
Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4  weigh around 120 lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
I liked this dress  but had some issues. i am 5' 3" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear  so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren't for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it.
Great idea  but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked  but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price  it did not justify a place in my closet?
Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky  although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!  but it's a keeper
Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!
Like the other reviewer mentioned  this jacket has a very trim fit  so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.
I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown  rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested  it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.
This skirt is so gorgeous. the picture doesn't do it justice. several layers of mesh. i am 5'10" and this skirt is very long  which i love. so glad i found this in my size for such a great price. highly recommended..
Super cut but easily wrinkles. eg. i ironed it  got dressed  then bent down to tie my daughters shoe and the whole front bottom was super wrinkly. i thought that it'd go away but it didn't... just got worse by the time i got out of my car at work... front and back were noticeably wrinkled all day.
Purchased this top online  and when i received it was very pleased.  it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.  love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.  also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.  with various necklaces this top has limitless options!  the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.  would have liked it to have a green tones  however it is still a fantastic f
This dress fits perfectly and true to size. the waist detail and flair is fun and flirty. it's probably my favorite dress i've ever bought.
Adorable  old school retailer; the only gripe i have is trying to get this on. the slip is similar to putting on a straight jacket. once you figure it out  then it's gorgeous. just be careful and lay it out carefully before you pull it over your head.
I bought 3 shirts in gold  black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.
It's not often you can find a dress that is warm  cozy  timeless  and sexy at the same time  but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s  and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be  depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place  so i'm not always adjusting it.  i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots
This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.
I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them  they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them! (i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose). my local store was willing to offer me an exchange. kudos to retailer's wonderful customer service and standing by their products! i actually wear mine un-cuffed with boots and it looks super cute.
After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the
I am 26 weeks pregnant and bought this in an xs to wear to my shower this weekend. i am delighted with how it looks on  but it really might be too big for someone who isn't pregnant.
At 5'4"  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!
I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.  very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.  the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online  was slightly disappointed with that  but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no "oh she is wearing that jacket again"....  the forest green is rich and elegant.  the fit is true to size  but this is not a fitted jacket  it falls more straight  but the peplum is a gorgeous accent.   a classic with impeccable quality!
I love pj's and other assorted lounging pieces  and this one is exceptional. in fact  i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store  and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.  the fit is tts. fyi: 36c  short waist  broad shoulders  5'3"  i normally wear a m/l in a chemise  and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room  but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves  without showing bumps
This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made  either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal  salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.
They were way way too small! i bought a 32 and they would probably fit someone that usually wears a 28. i was so sad to send them back because i loved them.
Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.
This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown. unfortunately  when i tried it on  it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to. i also didn't care much for the waist ties on the side. an elastic waist might have been better.
Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!
I saw this dress but was hesitant to purchase it online because of the reviews. i went to the absolutely fabulous new walnut creek store and though it wasn't on the floor they found one in my size in the storeroom.  i tried it on and was immediately enthralled. i am 5'10 and the dress flowed like a dream. i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings. i can't wait. it is lovely. you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder
This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!
This romper is really cute. it's flowy and wide at the middle  which i like. it's comfortable. i ordered my usual size small and it was too big. i'm hoping an exchange will do the trick .
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
This coat is so lovely  it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color  the style  the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons! like other reviewers  i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning  the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night  i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas  i am as yet
This dress is wonderful! word to the wise  it says that you can machine wash the dress on cold  which i did. the dress came out fine  but the slip is now basically a shirt. there are no washing instructions on the slip  but i assumed it would be the same. it is not. it still looks ok under the top part  but i will have to wear a half slip under the bottom.
I purchased this in the "purple" which is more blue than purple  but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful  rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles  but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet  so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am
I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut  however  it was way too short. i am 5'6" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it.
I am a huge pilcro fan. however  these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
Just received this in the mail  tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l  but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch)  in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy  stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s
The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
First off the prints are gorgeous - i ordered three. i wanted to love them but unfortunately i found them short and wide. so back they go..
I ordered the red color way  and the bird print is very cute. that said  it is cut a-line and not like a regular button down. through i found it tts and good quality  it was shorter than i would have liked. this exaggerated the a-line shape. i didn't completely dislike it  but i didn't love it either.
This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).  so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v
The embroidery is actually navy blue  not black like it shows in the photos  which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)
Was excited to receive this top in the mail  and wasn't disappointed when i tried it on. beautiful colors (true to image) and pattern -the blue back does extend into the front  but does not look unflattering in the least or leave for an awkward fit  imho. very happy with this top  it looks so cute from the back  too~
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!
These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?
This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful  vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty  swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs  but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly  the arms were cut too tight  the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet  that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the "hem" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.
Super soft fabric  however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl  normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it.
This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs  hourglass  curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite. (i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available). the dress lo
So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.
This is a lovely dress - however  there is a weird flap of fabric under the bow that doesn't sit right. it feels a little like a bib. if i could get it to sit right  i would keep it. every angle of the dress is lovely except for head on - which is a small problem.
I am ever in search of a light  white  summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers  and each of them is the scratchy  starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.
I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"
Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy  making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!
Based on reviews  i was concerned that this dress would not fit in the chest area. however  i find that i have ample room there (i am a full c). it is a tiny bit tight in the waist  but not uncomfortable or unflattering. i will go ahead and say that it runs small for that reason. the straps are a little long on me and will need to be taken up. also there is no zipper so getting it on and off requires unbuttoning the buttons  so it's not fast.     overall quality is very nice and it is very prett
I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
Love the top  it fits wonderfully  and it's lightweight. my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things. other than that  it's a great spring top.
I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.
A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!
I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition  the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues  i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k
I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun  swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!
Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.
First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out. the color looks nicer in person.  it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me. the jacket is very soft and well made.  the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal. can't wait to wear it when the full is here!
They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection  due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality  the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.
I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
I think i've made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits & rompers this season. i now own three (including this one in my usual size small: 32d-31-38). i passed right by this on-line but it drew my attention in the store. i didn't realize it was chocolate brown and ivory (i'm a sucker for brown). i tried it on on a whim and it looked great. i am tall--almost 5' 9" and it looked great. i will say it shows off my bottom (for better or worse) more than other jumpsuits. it doesn't give me a wedgie but a
I almost missed this  i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.
I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(
I have 2 of these now by the same designer. it's comfortable and will be a staple in my closet for summer  early fall and spring. it is a little on the long end but with platform heels  it's perfect.
Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin  so it works as a swim cover  but definitely not a dress for anything else.
This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.  all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i"m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.
I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model  but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!
Then this one is for you! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt  as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale. based upon the pictures  i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail  but it is actually masking this skirt's ugly secret:  a pouch. yes  it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen  which does not lay flat. the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots.                 this one
I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!
I bought both of these tees and they are perfect under my new fringe denim cloth & stone shirt and dress ....had to have both! the gray tee is so cute has every color of all my pilcro chinos...what a bonus. looks too cute paired with the denim shirts and is a great fall transition. i dressed up the cowboy tee with a chunky green stone necklace. i bought the small and for reference am 5'3" and 32h bra size and have no pulling so they are tts and only slightly shaped which works perfect for us bus
I don't if it is me  but usually i am a solid size 6  occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light  and while it is a weird texture  it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it didn't really feel "brand new" when it arrived
I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge. glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable. i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length. originally  i had also considered xxsp. while it fit well above the waist  it was slightly too short. for reference  i'm 5 ft 3.5 inches  105 pounds.
I purchased this jumpsuit in the store and i am so pleased with it. i am usually a 10 or 12 top and the large was good. the med was too tight on my bust. love the print very feminine without looking like pjs. cream background is beautiful. fabric is light and cool and i love the pockets. i was hesitant about the short length but i like it. this is a special piece. it's hard to find jumpsuits like this.
This cardigan/sweater/jacket is splendidly soft  wonderfully warm and super stylish. i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings. this piece will be timeless.
Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!
This dress is beautiful  but not made for someone with a 36d. i ordered a 12 and i could get my chest in this dress. i really wish it fit. it's well made and very beautiful. belt does not come with the dress.
These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon)  7% polyester  and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out.   .  these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton  18% modal  2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton  at least in the stevies.  .  i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b
Beautiful color. emphasizes a small waist; top is fitted  so if you're curvy  beware. i'm a 32 ddd and size 10. skirt is roomy. agree with other reviewer that zipper is not smooth. reminds me a little of a prom dress i had in 1987... which could be good or bad ;)
Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.
I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.
I love the dress  fits as pictured   i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper  well made.
This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love
I ordered these in m (5'8" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore  these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white  at that)  so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature
Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere
I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful!
I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably  i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room  would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.
After reading the reviews  i ordered an xs and a s in this  though i usually wear an xs in bordeaux. i kept the xs. to me  the sleeves and shoulders run small  while the rest of the shirt is flowy through the torso. i prefer more fitted shirts  but decided this one looked ok. at 5'6"  the hem hit at my hip. i did not find it scratchy at all. in the pink  with a nude bra  it is not terribly see-through  but with a black bra  it is. i washed it in a lingerie bag and laid it flat to dry. maybe it s
How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.
So  i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms  armpit  thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length  but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and
The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.
Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur
I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful
This dress is adorable  but fit a bit large through the waist. i ordered the 6 and am exchanging for the 4  so hopefully it will work better for me. for reference  i am 5'7  135 lbs curvy. the fabric is soft and swingy and the striped under-layer is feminine and adorable. love.
So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring  as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless  sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect  just wish retailer has more offerings like this.
I bought this blouse with the 30% off price- i don't think i would pay full price for it  but for the sale price i think it's fair.  as the other reviewers have said  it's definitely navy in front  not black  but it's a nice color combination and can be worn with dark jeans  or with black pants for a more casual work look.  it's sheer  but a dark cami underneath fixes the problem.  i think it fits true to size  with the understanding that it's supposed to be flow-y and loose.
Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely "vanity-sized". i'm 5'1  113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you
I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
I wanted this top in a petite xs  but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2" with a 34b bust  and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model  the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model  too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.
This is a very slimming  well-made  nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
This knit shirt is too thin  as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white  and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me  and was actually too long. had to return  especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs   which normally fits me.
This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up  8. (5'6"  135lbs  size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight  i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on  but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for  but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f
This robe is exactly what i was looking for.  it's perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off.  it is a little shorter than it looks on the model  but that's fine for me.  only downside is that it has to be hand washed.
I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer"s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is  for sure  very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust  this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist  but yes  i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on 
This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.
I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but  like the previous reviewer stated  not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes  despite the wash discrepancy.
Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area  waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!
I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.
After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl)  i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it "holds in" anything you want "held in" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold
Very nice sweater  surprisingly just as pictured color-wise  i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders  but this sweater flair out to the bottom  you can kind of see it in the photo  the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit  the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the
This dress is adorable in the photo; however  in reality  it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering  i would have sized down  but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly  i must return.
I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me  but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built
I purchased the grey in a medium  i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops  36 c.. i found it to fit quite well  but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me)  you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer  but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around  you could even see the width of th
This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however  the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.
I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture  feel great on  don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.
This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug  but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over  anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise  the top is great and perfect for summer.
Runs a little large. i'm 5'9''  150 lbs and ordered the medium. probably could have gone with the small. still  it has a tie waste so it works! love the length and print. can't wait to wear it this fall with a jean jacket!
I wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back. upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing. secondly  it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference  i ordered the 3  and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.
After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand  i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights  clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish  soft and very comfortable.
I love this dress. i'm 5'8" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist  so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like  i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.
I ordered the mauve in size xl and it fits true to size. it matched the photos online. all of the details are prettier in person. it's delicate. but  it's washed/dried well. very pretty shade of mauve.
I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.
I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27  which i would say is a pretty true 6.
The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.
Beautiful dress. loved the navy and the low v neck in front and back. but i had to return for smaller size. i am 5'2" 114 lbs. i ordered small and it was a little big and definitely long. i returned for an xs petite and am hoping it will fit perfectly!
I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area  it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).
This is a top-flight notch: an attractive design  nicely made. for me  the fabric is rather heavy for summer wear  but that won't prevent me from keeping it for cooler days. my one complaint is the sizing. i weigh a bottom-heavy 146 lbs. and hoped i'd get away with a medium. but it swims on me...not "a bit too large " but "way too large." i'm returning it and hoping that a small will be small enough.
It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better  probably too short for my age (40s).
I tried on this top in the store in a large and the arm holes were too big. i am busty and usually wear a size 10  so i usually need a m to l. i ordered a m which was shipped to my home  and it fit perfectly. really cute with skinny jeans!
I really lived the detail   fabric  and quality of this tank. however  the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing.
I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
I didn't think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn't show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it.
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the "skirt" is adorable.
I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.
This tank is pretty. it looks nice and is not cut too low. the bottom is "flowy" and not extremely fitted. i always get a lot of compliments when i wear it.
Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!
I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav
I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.
I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design  but when i received it  it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.
This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.
I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8" and curvy  and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however  this pair exceeded all my expectations! first  they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is
I was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.
I tried this dress on in the store  prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer  it would look more proportionate. next  the tie is really difficult to place  but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily  i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined  what a bummer  at least the skirt could be lined. but  it does have pockets  that is sweet.
I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.
I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that  which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!
Cute in concept  so large in reality. i am 5'3"  size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. don't even try if you are a little person. long and lean  yes  would probably look great on you.
Cute style  flowy fabric. it runs big i purchased a medium and could've definitely gotten a small.
This top is fun to wear & looks great with black  grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!
I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms aren't attached like a true poncho. it doesn't work for a petite customer  unfortunately  but on average sized it's gorgeous. so pretty.
Very cute shirt  well made  nice detail  but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
A beautiful blouse;however  i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also  and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.
I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
I'm curvy  and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome  especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips  so if you're trying to hide hips  these aren't for you. i love them  though--they drape beautifully and feel great.
The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.
So  so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
So often you find dresses in a cool  breathable material like rayon or silk  but the manufacturer lines it in hot  non-breathable polyester. which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day (or night). thankfully  someone at antropologie knows what they're doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon. thank you to that person.    yes  this dress is a bit on the short side. with it's modest neckline  it looks like it could be great for work  but it does hit a bit above the knee  so if you wo
I want to love this dress. the colors and the fabric are absolutely beautiful. it is definitely a swing-dress. much wider than i expected...and i sized down. there is also a strange pooch in the shape around the middle. i am keeping it because i am in love with the the colors and print  and it looks very flattering when paired with a black denim jacket  just not alone.
I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn't as r
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.
So soft  light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful  with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside  even though it's just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.  i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s  which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.
This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.
This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.
I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.
I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the "back view" picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model's black underwear.
I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.
This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!
This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!
I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere  more so than i thought it would be. but the neck  there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top  material is so-so.
I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.
Retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint. i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants. the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you can't tell by looking at the photo. i didn't mind it and thought it was actually a plus! i just think it is a bit too expensive  because although it is nice quality  i don't feel it is worth the price tag. pretty
The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra  no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top  because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package  it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated  it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the
I bought this in black. it's a great long length. i have long arms so the sleeve length is great. it's really soft. only issue is seems to sag a little in the middle instead of being flowy. overall a good tunic.
Purchased on sale  would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.
I think this top looks lovely; however  it does not fit my body shape. i am an hourglass shape. the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didn't drape nicely around my waist/hips like on the model. i think top could look great on someone who has a lean  square  or athletic build.    also  this top definitely runs large. according to the retailer size chart  i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements  but this top was much too large overall in a small and still
I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes  typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter  but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser  but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.
New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist  with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm  great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love
These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.
I really wanted to keep this dress  and the material is amazing  so soft and gentle and delicate  the design is great  the front looks nice  but from back looks really awkward  big and kind of too loose!
I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on
I tried this one as a xs and xs petite  and of course  the petite is the way to go for me. length slightly below around the knee  if i pull on the straps  then the hem hits the knees. i wish the blue was still available in petite  now that it is on sale. the waist is adjustable and so are the straps. the material is airy like linen. pretty and flirty  and appropriate for work  can't go wrong.    (115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist)
Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4  34 dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)
I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy  poor quality for the price.
I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right  it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point  but with the 25% of full p
Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference  i'm 5'4"  short-waisted with larger athletic thighs  smaller waist  bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i didn't have to cut off several inches in length  though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag  but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the
Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink  size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly  i could even probably go to an xs  but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.
I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item  or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.
Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out  so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks  i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.
I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return)  i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.
I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
Ordered the pink in a small  but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit  i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!
This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!
This is a very cute  casual sweater. i originally ordered a size medium but i had to send it back because it was way too large all over. i recently received the size small and i'm going to keep it. it is still a roomy fit but the overall design of the sweater is a relaxed fit. the color combination and texture of this sweater is lovely.
I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design  it did not work for me.
Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
This was adorable  but looks much better on the lean  flat chested model. i am only 110 lbs and 5'4" but i am curvy and it just didn't do me any justice so i will be returning. i think this would look better on someone more flat chested  because it really accentuates the bust.
I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.
Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!
My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online  so that was nice to see consistency. overall though  i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks  which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short  and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving  walking or dancing in this dress  which brings me to the question of
The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.
I like the color blocking of this top  but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.
The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
I would have to wear a camisole underneath this  which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear  not something i'd have to layer.
I love this sweater. i didn't buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i'm happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference  too. i wasn't fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made
This polo shirt has just the perfect amount of feminine detail to make it a great addition to my wardrobe. i love the shorter version  and it looks great with both jeans or skirts.
This top is has an awkward neckline  doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw  and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty  but that is it :(
Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!
The photos really doesn't do this sweater justice. when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos. this will be great over jeans or slim pants. i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big. at 5'5" it drapes nicely and covers my rear end. the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms. others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the
The material  deep color and design are gorgeous. however  the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p  and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.
This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls  being only 5"1  the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so
The dress is great for pear shapes. however  i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable  not too thick or thin. however  i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.
I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.
This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!
The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4  which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips  but the shape worked well for my shape.
I had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale. i'm still on the fence. i love the material and pattern but it is really long  and i'm 5'10". it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better. overall i think it is a great piece.
I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size  as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
The waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser. i think these pants are a little large and wide-legged. i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me. i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up. i feel like they would look best on a taller person. i need to get them hemmed.
I was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me. very comfortable and flattering on me. love the look. need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that
I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online  and decided to order it. the fabric is soft  but strong  and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.
I'm 5' 7 and bough a size 8 regular. this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff. cute pattern  but i'm returning it.
This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts  but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
Very cute top! even prettier in person! i ordered it by mistake but i am definitely keeping it! the regular xs size fits perfectly (i was concerned about my twin sisters!)
These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5" and the size 4 fit in the waist  but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on  they're also very poofy right below the waist.
How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper
These are colors i normally never wear...baby pink  lavender  light blue...but what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in. it's my favorite. i also adore a good poncho. this poncho is so rich and so heavenly. super soft  very oversized  incredibly nice fabric...its like a light weight sweater. lots of movement and such a statement piece  it will look great over a white tank top  or an all black ensemble with great boots. this only comes in two sizes but runs large. i'm 5'8 and curvy...and
I ordered this dress in the green  and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size  which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!
When i saw this dress i knew i had to have it! i loved the colors and design. i am a wedding planner and dresses with pockets are my "uniform"  i was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews  but i ordered anyway and am glad i did! it fits perfect and looks just like the photo.
Absolutely love everything about this dress!!! i'm 5'9 138lbs purchased a small. hits just slightly above the knee... has a fun flow to it! absolutely love the chest detail! cute buttons! and the embroidered detail is amazing!
This dress is beautifully made  and has a lovely sheen to it. it's elegant and can be worn on different occasions. it's a very feminine dress. i ordered the dress in a few sizes and a size 2 fit me the best as i have a small bust line.
I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.
Not sure who named this dress  but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric  with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes  leather flip flops  and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!
If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips  the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you. ---------- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops  and went with the m  and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms  i would recommended sizing down a size. ---------- i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5") rise jeans  then yes  you will
These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts  tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.
Fell in love with this dress when i saw it. beautiful design and flow. although it needs an underskirt  because it is a see through. also it is a bit tight on the chest section. i haven't wore it yet  so more to come..
This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?
I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.
Everything about this dress is just right! the hand of the fabric is soft and drapes beautifully  the cut is slender but forgiving  the length is short enough to be chic but not skimpy  and the fringe and hemline keep it from looking like every other denim shirtdress out there. i am 5'7" 125 lb and got an xs. i love the versatility too--as a dress  jacket  under layer  with/without a belt. yay!
Great color fit was very true to size
Love love love this shirt!  great quality .. washes / dries wonderfully!  it is loose and flowy .. it's supposed to be that way - but it lays nicely!  it's longer than pictured which i love - i'm sure i'm shorter than the model but it's truly a perfect shirt! goes great with my jean skirt.. jeans  shorts and dressier skirts.  if you get a chance to order .. don't hesitate!  :)
I ordered christmas presents online this year. they arrived very quickly and were well received! they are ferry pretty!!! i will order online again!!!
I normally wear a xs  but i got a small so it would be a little longer. great quality and adorable!
Material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants. otherwise  a great deal if you get them on sale.
I love this dress! it feels great on. it's very light. the color is absolutely gorgeous! the only thing i was disappointed in was that there was no lining  for the cost of this dress  it should at least be lined.
I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m  and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column  i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it  but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing  and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large  i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference  i'm 5'7''  125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops. i also love that it has pockets :)
I ordered this top in a 14  my usual size  and it fits fine  but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist  almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.
These pants are gorgeous! they are not a denim material  more like the softest khakis you've ever felt. they're very flattering and hug all the right places. i am a 4-6 in pants and the 27 feels great. a worthy investment!
I really like this blouse. you could wear it tucked  but the pleats would disappear. my only complaint is that it's a bit too full round the waist. it would be a good choice for thanksgiving dinner!
Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top  easily dress up and down!
Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy  hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.
The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
The fabric is a little stiff  the back looks unusually long compared to the front  and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
I purchased my wife this shirt for christmas and she loved it! the quality of the shirt is amazing and now she wants them in every color! even though she says she's kidding  i really know that she isn't.! :#  the information i fill out #below) is about my wife  not me!
I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.
They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them  because again  the fit! the style! alas  about the fifth time i wore them  the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo  but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.
Love this blouse  however upon every time i wear it  a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!
Love this top!
Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"  135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is  i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2" longer would also be a slightly better length.
Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
Lovely  warm sweater. excellent quality  fits as shown on model
This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big  as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way  the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.
These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
I'll start with what i loved  this dress is made with a really beautiful  quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b
The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!
I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky  i love the back  how it ties  and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go  just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...     reference: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.  just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!  it is elegant  classy  and an understated sexy!  the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!  the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!  beautiful and flattering fit.  it is a 10 !!!!  i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size  but slig
Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5" 5' 127lbs.
This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
Stretch out fast    5 8 130lb i order size 26 which is my usually size. they fit prefect for about 3hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body. maybe i should have gone down a  sizes. even so i feel like the $$$ and quality don't add up but they are very soft and comfortable  i wouldn't buy them again.
I ordered this online and the colors are prettier in person. the blue and gray contrast nicely and have a beautiful sheen to them. i am usually a 2 at retailer and while that fit  i felt i could size down. i am slender and since it is a shift  there was little room in the waist/butt area. i ordered a 0 and that fit perfect! if you love blue (like i do)  this dress is for you!
Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down  but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however  it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large  but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium  and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre
Fit true to size and very well. hit the leg at a good length. i'm 5'5. they were perfect.
I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"  medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal
I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the "flare" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips. ------------------------- that said  i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby  it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long
This is my new favorite sweater. it is a great mid-weight sweater  that hangs beautifully with an interesting bottom hemline. im so happy with this purchase. im 5-9  155# and the m is perfect.
I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p
Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections  flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.
I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe. i did purchase the petite since i'm 5'2" and it worked out great. very nice style  comfy and flattering. looks great with a pair of boots. one of my go to dresses for sure.
Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!
Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
While i love the design and shape of this blouse  the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.
First of all  i've noticed that maeve is running big  i'm normally a size medium or 6 and two occasions now i've needed a size small and this is no different. of course i ordered the medium and would need to exchange it if i want it to fit better. it's loose allover. the only reason i'm not exchanging it is that the color washes my olive skin color. other than that it's a beautiful dress  it hist at the same spot on the leg as in the model's pictures. for reference  5'9"  36b  29"  38".
I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!
I adore a good vest  so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often  but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it  took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl  and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line  and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin  or even w
This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress  even with the slip  which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip  wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
This dress is so cute  and i received so many compliments on it! i wore it on a gameday  and it was so comfortable. i love the skirt of the dress because of the trendy v's. the top was too loose for me  so i had to get it taken in. this is surprising because i have a decent sized chest and broad shoulders. other than that  this dress is a real winner!
Wore this & got many compliments. true to size  elegant.
I typically do well with jumpsuits but this one did not work. i am smaller on top than the bottom but not by much. i got the xs and it was tight in the calves and short in the waist but the top fit perfectly. maybe a s would have fit better but i got it on sale and s was out of stock. it defiantly did not look like it does on the model. :) i am typically a size 2. the material is really nice. i was hoping for a jumpsuit that could be casual an covered since most jumpsuits tend to show more skin
This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves  but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty  so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open  but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed  which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6" and the length was just right  abou
It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.
I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites  i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.     i'm 5'6  160 lbs  and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length  waist and bust fit perfectly.
If you are afraid of the jumpsuit trend but like dresses  this will be for you.    the cut is flattering  and may not need a bra (i am droppy  but it was fine). the legs are wide enough that one time  i had both legs in one hole  so-to-speak  and it is very flowy. the patterns are both nice  i like the geometric one  but the polka dot is always a classic. the petite size fit me just right (xsp) at 115 lbs  30dd. i like the tie it goes from around the cups to tie on the back  so you can almost ti
The cut is wonderful and the fabric is soft and flowy. it is pretty sheer so a slip is recommended. i wish this dress had a lining like some other dresses i've gotten at retailer.
Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.
Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
I ordered a small and medium because i was worried about the chest being too tight (i am 5'6"  140 lbs  34d) but i was swimming in a size medium. it was huge. the small really fits me just fine. my only issue is that the very bottom of the sleeves is tight. i would like to push them up a little since they are 3/4 length  but they are tight. i am still keeping the small though....maybe i'll do surgery on the cuffs!
I just purchased this cardigan  it is better in person than the picture. the fit is fabulous  it is very versatile. it can be worn with many different options  definitively be wearing often.
This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal  but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up  dressed down  worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too "out-there" (unless you want it to be  of course!). the fit is true to size  and the delicate details are just lovely.
Soft comfortable material- love the carbon color. great everyday casual tee but with a nice bit of detail.  i liked it so much that i ordered a second one!
I purchase this top of "what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope
I love this dress. as a petite woman  it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself  it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus
This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .
Comfy  will be great with a sweater or vest over it.  love the pink color.
Love the warm color and soft fabric - paired with chic tights and ankle boots and it fits right into a more casual workplace.
I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet  feminine  yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year  i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see  near perfec
Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.
I saw this dress several times and never try it. then i finally put it on. omg  i love it! it does run large. i am usually medium. but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color. but the orange one is cuter on me. the length is great. i am 5'4''. it's right to my lower ankle. so i don't need to wear heel. the quality is very good. it's a great weekend dress.
I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing  but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.
This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights  etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you  buy it!
Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs  purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!
The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought
Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material  i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!
When i saw this item online  i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it. the pros: very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo  the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had
This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.
I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size. now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product.
I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.
Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i'm not. going back.
Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.
Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock
I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color  slightly heathered.    what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.    i wore the tank out and about  and it was comfy and pretty. later  though  my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough  it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time  i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit
I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing  since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly  so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design  but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.
The neckline is beautiful! it's super soft and comfy. sadly  my normal large looked very boxy. i am hoping the medium will fit better.
I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn't like the material either.
When i saw this online i immediately put it on my "must buy" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily  my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol
I am in love with this dress. not too dressy  not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them  super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress  which looks easy to do  because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.
This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4"  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online.
As another reviewer mentioned  maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4  and while it fits  i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared  but also short  making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable  i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don
I am curvy/petite. this fits great  is true to size  is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made.
I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.
Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.
Picked this up in the store today  but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo  but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing  but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
I got this vest on sale in the navy color and love it! the quality of the fabric is great and the draped design of it is so chic! really adds a stylish touch to almost any outfit.
This general sweatshirt is cute  stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.
I tried on the 00p in the store as a return  adn though it would fit (super stretchy)hte dress ended up mid thigh for me... gorgeous design and make though  the buttoning is incredible  buttons and clasps to keep the dress closed. love love  wish htey still had my size (0p or 2p ) to try if hte length would be better (or regular size)
I'm usually a small (5'5"  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect
I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
These jeans are excellent! i've been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it. there's lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape. i highly recommend!
The top is nice  good quality  etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
Maybe it's because i'm 40  but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big  obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model  so maybe it's a "younger" top. i would have felt silly wearing it.
I picked this dress up in a size 8 - fits tts. i have a 34dd chest; 145 lbs. and 5 ft. 4 inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size 10 was too big and the 8 fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not  it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about 2 inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday
I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however  it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed  as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one  maybe two sizes.
I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned  it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.
This skirt is nicer in person. the fit is a little strange. the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large. i am a curvy size 8 and purchased the 6 based on another review. the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits. it's too beautiful to return.
I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight  but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long  but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it  which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.
This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
As other reviews noted  this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality  but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7"  and if i were any less  i don't think this would work for me at all.
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.
I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear  i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper  outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all  but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.
I wanted to love this. i have been looking for a poncho-type sweater for our cold midwestern winters. the cream colored one that i really wanted sold out instantly and i missed the window for the xxsp. i ordered this in the xs/sp (smallest size available). i am 5'1" and 108 lbs with small shoulders. the neck opening is huge. my collar bones and a seciton of my upper back were exposed. this would not keep me warm due to so much exposed skin on my neck  back  and shoulders. i suppose i could get a
Cute enough  but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves  oddly placed.
This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have   a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material   like cotton versus polyester  but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.
This shirt works for both going out and going to work  and i can wear it with everything. fits perfect  tucked and untucked  tied and untied. i love it.
Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable  stylish  packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses.
I'm 5'7"  34c  28 jeans  size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots  but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small  which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me  it makes the sleeves less cartoonish.
This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality  but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit  just wasn't as striking as i expected.
These pants are so comfortable  it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.
Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5"130lbs  and 32dd.
I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.
Larger than life in both size and personality. this one runs pretty big however the detailing in the fabric itself and embroidered collar balance that out. it's even more gorgeous in person!   for reference  i'm 5'7"  125lb  straight up and down and i usually go for a 4 or 6 / small. i got a 4  but could have easily fit into the 2 or even the 0.
I purchased the washed-out blue color. it is lovely with blue or black jeans. medium fit great. it is heavier cotton  and ever so slightly stretchy. this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee. it is very comfortable. the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch  and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back. a fun addition to my casual wardrobe.
Maybe i didn't read the description correctly  but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits  thigh-level  rather than just one  as shown in the photo above. it's gorgeous silk  the patterns are vivid  and the pleats are classy  giving just the right balance of form and flow. however  when i sat down  very little coverage!! ...which means i wouldn't wear it much. i considered taking it to my tailor  but too much effort and $$. however  it's beautifully crafted if you're looking for som
This is a lovely dress  with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however  it runs small in the waist  if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
I'm normally a 12/14 and ordered my normal size 32 which fit perfect. i purchased both the red and beige. the quality fit and color are great. i'm 5'9 and the regular length was fine.
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.
I am somewhere between a size 6 or 8  so i ordered this dress in a size small. mistake. too small. the color of this dress is so lovely. it's between red and orange. will probably order it in medium.
I love the color and cut of the pants. they are more a dark indigo twill than a jean  to be sure. a fit issue is how the front pockets pop out because of the excessive stretchiness of the fabric. i wear them and love them  but stitched the front pockets closed to avoid the unflattering pop-out pockets.
Beautiful dress. not lined  but the fabric is sturdy enough. i do prefer a slip under but that is my preference for most things. great for dressing up or down. so comfortable.
I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot  especially the front macrame part  but for me it did not work at all. also  too expensive for a tee.
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.
Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great  denim is just the right thickness  i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right.
When i unwrapped this a chemical "stink" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo
I am partial to maeve tops  i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering  i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a 4 (i go between 2 and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f
This is very cute. it's lined  it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees  which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!
I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back  but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4"  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.
The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!
I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on  however  you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5'2  so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture  but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now  all i need is the sun!
This sweater was far better than expected. very soft  and flattering. it's light to wear  but keeps me cozy in my freezing office. looks super cute with jeans and boots.
Bought peach online  but exchanged for other color. there is a metallic gold stripe that i didn't expect in peach option. i thought i would mention as it wasn't so apparent in photo. interestingly there is no metallic thread in the other color option.
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.
I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through. taking it back.
5'7"  34c  28 jeans  4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist  but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey  but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned  i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color  transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh
I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately  it did not work out. fit is tts  i liked the fabric which is soft  silky yet with some weight to it  and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely  swingy but not too full  hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders  it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too
Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more "normal" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!
This jumpsuit is absolutely beautiful. it fit like a glove and made me feel incredibly classy and sexy at the same time. i am 5'4" and ~120lbs and the 4 fit like a glove and right at my ankles and above my elbows  the 6 fit a bit more loose and below my ankles and right at my elbows. it is so different and easy to wear.
This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
I had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well  and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.
This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo  and i am short at 5' 2". cute top  but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style.
Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.
I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!
Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders  so this is a definite for my fall / winter season.
Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
This shirt is just as great in person as it is online.  it's a substantial fabric which is not see-through which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops.  the color is more off-white without looking yellow.  i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves.  they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted  but not in a bad way.  i'm 5'5" and found the length to be jus
I found it hard to pair with bottoms. fit wasn't very flattering for me.
I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.
I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!
I saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.
The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big  so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice  is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too  perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar
The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy  it was too flimsy  the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7" 135 the dress was long enough  just didn't flow very well.
Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly  and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt  and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color  the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect.
This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white  which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color  but i returned it since it was nothing special.
I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd  148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago  the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer
This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access  or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material  but not worth it if it's difficu
This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.
Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.
I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.
This dress is perfection! great  quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!
Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than "blue" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust  blue  goldenrod  green throughout. super soft  stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33" bust  long torso  broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.
This top is really a great  and it's very affordable. the fabric is light weight  but opaque enough that you don't need a cami. even though this has long sleeves  i can imagine wearing this well into the summer (and i live in south florida). it's comfortable  and the band at the bottom is not tight. the color is slightly ivory and the floral print is clear and bright. the neck tie is really nice and adds a '70's vibe without being overdone or overly dramatic. definite keeper.
I am 5'3" and 115 lbs. i ordered 2 on a whim and i'm so happy i did because they're so flattering.
Was excited to receive this dress  as it had some great reviews. however  of the love was coming from the 5'5"+ set. as a petite  this didn't work well for me  and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way. returned.
What a great  soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.
Like other ladies have mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up!  __________  pros:  - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.  - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.  - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.  - good overall length.  - usa made!  __________  cons:  - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c  hourglass  170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops
Like other reviewers have mentioned  i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body  i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places  and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl  so i wasn't sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom
This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders  i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the
I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places  too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b
It's thin  very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!  it's a stink top  i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.  aside from being a swing top  it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.  i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too  love it!
I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute  great transition piece into spring.
These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.
Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading
I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve  you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck  so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better
I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long  which is great for me since i'm taller.
I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it's basic black  but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer  and it's stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit  depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined  which is a big plus. i was
This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering. being 6'0" it's also long enough for me.
In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section  and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft  thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little  especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great  casual day t.
I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately  after reading the reviews  and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses  so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this "in between" that i am  i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.  style is fun and flir
I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0  98 lbs  32a  and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly  which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest  so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves
This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure.
I'm very pleased with my purchase of this dress. it is perfect for dancing or a spring/summer wedding or doing out. it is very flattering on my rather straight/slender/petite frame. i ordered a size 4 and it was tts. if it only had pockets  it would be absolutely perfect!
I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!
I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman  i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!
Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.
I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!
I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!
I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable  thick but not too warm. they are my 'nice' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i'm usually a large or xl.
This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric  i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4"  about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee  which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all  i can see mys
This dress pattern and material are great - it's just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad  it had some real potential.
I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!
Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa
This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets  but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"   120 lbs.  but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips  but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled  but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!
It fits perfectly  slim but not clingy  and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.
This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!
I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.
I really love this top. it's cute  whimsical  and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it's a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it  especially during the tag sale.
Great alternative to yoga pants  these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!
I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.
I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.
The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
I ordered the coral  size small  it's a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft. it is longer  and roomier in the waist than i was expecting  however  with skinny jeans it looks great. the detail makes this top very eye-catching  i'm very happy with my purchase!
I cant say enough about these pants - they are such good quality. i bought the xs. they are tight enough and don't create crease in my legs. length is perfect for my 5.1 statue.
I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone  which suits me just fine. they are
As a long standing retailer shopper  i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down; this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well  hooks to close are substantial; the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus  but though the colors are delish  the fabric is a bit questionable.  the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted  but looking at the same vest
Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.
I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.
I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on  but didn't fit me.
I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.
You do not want to know how many cropped  wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right  apparently. these are great: comfy  make my legs look cute  not chopped off  they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the "let out" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.    i bought
Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
I bought a size s in the navy  and m in the neutral  and both fit. i usually wear a small  but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big  but the extra room fits the flowy  bohemian style of the blouse  so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
I wanted to love this dress  but it has too many flaws. first  the "waistband" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second  the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third  i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side  the fabric isn't scratchy.
These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on  but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric  but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece.
I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted  keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!
The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says "mesh" it means "mesh"! i was thinking the "mesh" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.
I adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a 34c and size 6 and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well  as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one  since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer  but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top  etc.)
I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the
This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very   pretty dress. simple  classic and gorgeous!
The dress is too big. i got size 4  after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"  125 lb). it is too wide  not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady  but looks pathetic on me).     the pattern is too bright  much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately  it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.    the material is heavier than i expected.
This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat
Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms  the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.
I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist  but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging  but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch  but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference  i am 5'4"  34/26/38  and i got a 6 regular.
I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows  the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.
I really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
I'm petite  short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates).     unfortunately  the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise  however  it would have been too long for my torso  which i run into a lot.     too bad.
I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south  but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin  but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8  weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8  but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.
This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.
This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on.
In contrast to the other reviewer  i love this dress. worth the sale price at least.
This tee is s bit on the pricey side but well with it. soft fabric  and unique mix beautiful colors (i got the grey  blush  and gold) that will offer a lot of options on terms of what it can be worn with. i love splendid and this tee is why i do!
They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!
This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long  but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!
I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size.
These are the best jeans ever! never wore pilcros before and only ordered them because they were on sale. so glad i did! now i'm hooked!
Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
I got this top in black and didn't realize until i got it that it has velvet accents. it is beautiful  sophisticated and can be a great party  work  or play top!
I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits  but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.    true to size.
Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment  i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately  this one's going back.
I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short 
I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper  looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit  lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.
This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy  feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs  it's long on me at 5'4" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h
I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower  rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i
Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.
The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-34 d with arms that aren't tiny  and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much
I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
Flattering  comfortable  and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model  i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark  slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors  as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt  or under a blazer to work.    i've washed the garment once on the
I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.
So lovely.  perfect print / graphic.  want to buy in both colors but the yellow is perfection.
Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .
I liked the understated colors of this dress  so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering  it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long  but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly  my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.
Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season 
This sweater is very pretty  i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to  and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!
It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.
This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s
I just bought this dress in the store and i love it. i'm in my 50s and it does every thing i need a dress to do. it has sleeves  it's modest enough and shows my shape. the colors are great and go with most shoes. i'm heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches. great buy!
I love this sweater! i have gotten so many compliments. it is so comfortable and unique. i am planning on ordering the same sweater in another color. i wear a small and ordered a small. it fit me perfectly. i shop at retailer for a lot of my clothes because they are well made and different.
This bikini bottom is great design and quality but runs small. overall i would recommend.
This top is beautiful  really special. i am a 32dd and this type of flowy top sometimes doesn't work for me but this one is fine. looks great with skinny jeans and boots or flats.
I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself  but i couldn't say no to that sweet little back detail. i'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric  you've found your answer and then some!
I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality  and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8  but my store only had a 4 available. it fit  but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model  but i'm on the short side.
This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull  no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap  shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on  because it was so hideous  when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
I love retailer clothes  but i've often ordered shirts in an xs that i really needed an xs petite in because of the length and fit through the bust  but they didn't have any petites in the size i needed. i'm at 5'1"  114 pounds. i got this shirt in xs (not petite) and am thrilled with the fit. the material is formfitting enough to look like a petite  and it doesn't drop below my waist line. i'm thrilled with my purchase!
Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties
I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however  it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price.
I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist  however.
Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state  it is short and wide. i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.
Since these are high waist pants  i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"  150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs  the size 31 ran about 5" above my ankle  higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great.
This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.
This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said  "meh " so back it went.
This dress is so soft  and fits like a dream. i'm a new mom and the tie perfectly masks what's left of my mummy tummy  while still helping me feel stylish for fall!
High quality  and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.
Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.
This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.
Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.
Beautiful top  i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
I was excited to get this romper  but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.
I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still  i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort
I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online  but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo
Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small  but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people 
The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.
Love the aqua print  which looks vaguely japanese to me. the quality is good  but unlike the other reviewer  i had to size up. my usual size x small was too tight. wish there were more colors.
It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.
I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however  when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.  also  i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks  but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok  but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker  this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this  i wouldn't recommend.
This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
Great style but not so great quality:(  stone fell off right away.  but they still look great
I normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall  hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers. however  i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by it's color and beautiful sequins. my thoughts below:    ________  pros:  - exactly as pictured. i got the purple option  but i did see another lady grab the green. both are beautiful in different ways.  - like another mentioned  the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress  but in a g
Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired.
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large  i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress  for example  fits just fine in my regular size.) so  i ordered this dress in my regular size. well  i tried it on  and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit  even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy! this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j
This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5" and it falls to the knee on me  longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!
Unlike the other reviewers  i did not have any problem with the sizing  fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"  135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.
I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable.
I hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet... so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced  my usual xs looked huge and hte "hip" part flared out in a funny way. i did  however decide to order it online in petties  to see( i really do love the design in the front  and the hemline is fun and unusual). they didn't have my usual xs so odrdered xxs  just to see... what a great choice  it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful... jsut wish it wasn't so pricey  but wil ke
36dd  10/12 in tops  12/14 in bottoms this is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on  however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck  and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big  i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!
The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!
I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color  since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
Love this sweater. the hi-low length is fun. the elbow length sleeves are great. wish retailer offered more colors! low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well. works well with jeans or leggings. overall perfect layering piece for all seasons.
Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin  which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.
This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.
I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve
I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says "viscose lining" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us
As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure  and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store  it was closed in the front with the pin  which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model  so it looked fantastic. however  when i tried it on myself  it wasn't quite the same.
Like all maeve tops of this nature  i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue  the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!)  and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops  but i do not have one in a color like this
This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.
Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.
I got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though
I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large  it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath  but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest  but this was ridiculous. beyond that  the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale  it was not worth the price and i returned.
I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great  i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest
This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight "sweatshirt" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable  machine washable.  an unexpectedly "nicer than it looks online" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.
I'm short and curvy and just had a baby. love this cape because it's super comfy and warm but not too warm. have had it for a couple of weeks now and it's my go to for running around during the day. the description says grey but it reads a tiny bit green - like light camo green but so slight that it still pairs well with most everything.     usu a med but got the xs/s because of how slouchy it is anyway. med looked too big in the shoulders.
Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.
The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also  the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so  i have bought 3 new pairs  and all have been so disappointing. first of all  the quality is horrible now. in the past  they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened  pilcro?!?!?
Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season  i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color  and found these. i bought them in blue  gray  and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more "rustic" than the average tight  almost like they are leggings  not tights. they are a lit
I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back  thin  silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .
Perfect dress for the hot late summer/early autumn weeks! this beauty is flowy and rich in color. the tie back is adjustable which i love due to my weight fluctuations. because of the tie  length can be adjustable too! i'm short so the decision lies on what shoes i want to wear and how high i want my hem. this dress looks cute belted or with my cropped moto jacket thrown on top. all in all  i really like this dress and i see it staying in my closet for a long while if the horrid viscose construc
I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also  the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol
Love this top  just received it today.  it is a very artistic interpretation for a casual top.  the blue is gorgeous!  the unique style of the peplm and the details on the front set this apart!  runs a little shorter  but i feel the length enhances it;s beauty  and is appropriate for the overall design.  love !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly.
I purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small  but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou
I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item  but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.
I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
Cute shirt  it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!
I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it  i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however  the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.
This was a holiday splurge and combined with a sale discount  it was a good price. i love this coat. i agree with some of the shapelessness in the back. but it's not a deal breaker for me. the overall cuteness won me over.
I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
Soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm. flattering cut. quality material and construction. fully opaque  so no show-though. true to size (i'm 5'8"  140 lbs  my usual size small is perfect). could not improve upon these joggers. love  love  love.
No  no  no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7"  about 145  32c  usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the
The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
I wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(
After reading the reviews  i decided to order this top. i was so pleased  and when i wore it for the first time  i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.
This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it's true to size  size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b  26 waist  36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like
I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft  coarse on the inside  and feels old.  the back is longer than the front  it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots  it looks worn.
I bought this on sale. the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves. a little see through  but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath.
These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids
These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j
This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.
I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14  i am 5' 6". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size.
I wanted to love this dress. i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive. when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought. i'm not sure if i misunderstood the images  but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over  i just thought that the fabric had a texture. the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me. i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips  but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am. i think this w
I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.
Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment 
I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust  and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee  but sadly  that wasn't the case.
I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again  but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream "look at me" (let's be honest  there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi
I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it  love the print.
Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico  but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
The color of this top is lovely. however  i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.
I purchased this in the blue motif.  i am 5'4  118 pounds and got an xs. i love everything about this tee. it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts! i haven't worn it off the shoulder yet.  i think it looks great as a regular tee. i get compliments whenever i wear it.  so happy with this purchase!
I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately  for a well endowed woman like myself  it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(
I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.
I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better)
This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange  which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice  hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details  the scallops  and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips  so get in the w
I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !
I bought the moss  which is more of a pretty pastel green. they are very nice in that they aren't tight  yet stylish and i can dress them up. the only drawback is that they stretch a lot. i can get two wears out of them  maybe a 3rd  if not worn for hours and hours or all day each wear. i'm getting the light yellow pilcro hyphen chinos  now. all the colors of both styles in the store are very nice. i'd like to have each color. for reference - i'm 5'2" and size 27. i would say that they are tts b
Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.
When i saw this dress in the store in a size small (i usually wear a large)  i thought  "how cute!" so i tried it on. it fit very well...all but in the armhole. so i decided to order a medium. i received the medium and it fits exactly like the small  armhole and all. in addition  i agree with other reviews that this dress' description "above the knee" does not accurately describe length unless you're somewhat tall. i found this dress hit me just where i'd like it to...right above the knee. not a
I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!
This sweater jacket is beautiful!  i wasn't going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy  but i am so glad i did.  it's super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.  i have a petite frame  and it doesn't look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do.  totally recommend this one!
Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.
This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
These are so comfy! mom of two boys on the go! great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town! not mom jeans!
I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews  i think this dress runs large. i am a 4 and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!
I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top  but i don't see how i can wear it.
I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.
Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference  i'm 5'4  124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing  i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small  but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely  but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig
It was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it.
The dress is pretty  i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran  i took both back the neck is too tight!
I haven't worn the top yet nor have i returned it. still not sure if i want to keep it! i bought the slate color and it is a bland color. also  not sure if i like the fabric because the material feels like it could be a pajama top! however  it is a comfortable loose fitting top so for that reason  i may keep it.
I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase
This dress is elegant and really lovely. it looks like a throwback to the 20s and 30s. it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types. and this is why i am recommending it. but be warned: it runs large.  the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at all--it is completely sheer. for example  i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric  which is not the look i'm going for. this might be a deal breaker for some. for me  i
This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size  xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket  although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right  not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me  but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over  particularly making my waist look small.
These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.
My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this  but i thought it was cute and springy.    i tried on a large first  since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders. (i'm tall  big boned and 175 pounds) the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didn't do much for my shape.    the medium  however was great! it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldn't
The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.
The stress is a simple basic. i got it in the navy stripe and have worn it with the long gray scarf  similar to pictured. it is very soft and comfortable.
I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back  but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.
I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look  it has long sleeves  and the color is beautiful. i can't tell if there is sparkle in person  it looks like it on pictures  or holes... but regardless  love it. i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me  for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger  this is more a "classic" size  as in what i would have ordered in the past (this summer  i had to go down in size a lot). the fabric is c
Completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me.....boxy  baggy  shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned.
The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though  and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.
I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still  i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house  doing chores  resting  etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but  around home  it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.
I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.
If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
Great dress. looking forward to wearing it with tights. fits great.
I love this in the red motif....looks great with jeans or white. for maeve  this runs a little larger. at 5'8" 130 lbs  i typically need a 6 to keep the front from pulling/gaping. the 6 in this was roomy and the 4 was also good. took the 6 for a little extra length. the shirt hits be about like the model in length  and while a little cropped  it won't show your stomach.
This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
This sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter legging/boot rotation with different vests  belts  and scarves...spot on. it is not heavy weight  soft  perfect length for a tunic on a 5'4 frame  34c  125 lb....now the weird part - sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear??? anyway  hand wash and little to no pilling a plus. i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome  hence t
I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately  the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small  as this coat appears slightly more snug on top  a-line on the bottom  with three buttons.  i am 5'6" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back.
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
But i stil ldecided to pass. i would need the petite as it seemd long. also  there are other items i loved more  but if you need a cozy sweater that is different  this might be the one for you. the contrasting detaisl on the sleeves/collar are very nice.
Love  love  love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style  it's very soft  very flattering  and very comfortable. fits tts  and the fabric is a very soft  stretchy cotton  yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice  flowy fit#. it washes great  doesn't pill #again  the fabric is fantastic)  and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year  but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin
I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price  i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade  but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
Love this beautiful sweater! it's become one of my wardrobe staples. it's got a great cut and i love the design.
I am so in love with this skirt  but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color  quality  and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back.
Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....
Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.
Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).
Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise  you might like them. i can't comment on fit..
I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.
I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
A 3-season top that compliments jeans  dress pants  shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders  length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.
This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.
I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
This skirt material and quality is top notch. i'm not a "mustard yellow" fan but the color combo in this is just stunning! i'm 5'4"  125#  27/4 usually and picked a 4 in this which would have been correct. the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist. in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top. this would look beautiful on anyone approx 5'6" or over i think! oh  and the drape is beautiful  not super full.
The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.
Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm  although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too :)
Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans  shorts  crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger  i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple  wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.
This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
I love the pattern adn color combo  but  wow t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway  not for me  but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.  length was decent in regulat size though  not too long. just too wide.
This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order  please take the
This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material  but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately  i must return it.
Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9" so normally wear medium. however  could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!
This top was too big for me. 5'4  135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work  but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back.
I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.
Fabric is the nice comfortable hh fabric they have been using to make dresses and shirts. it wrinkles a little though. also feel "heavy" though not too warm. i like the collar not being a fold over. teh dress wasn't too short on me (00p) in front  and does go longer in the back (high low) - not an issue for me. i ordered the navy    i decided not to keep it only because i don't really need it and they make a similar version every year. but if you don't have it yet  good to have.    i am 115 lbs 
I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to "pull up" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#
I love this dress! it is comfortable and pretty  well made and classic. it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big. i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect. i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also!
It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.
This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors  fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site.   .   i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage  not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support  and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w
I am just over 5'8"and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso  almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition  they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame  they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.
These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.
I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.
I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
Love this poncho! purchased xs in gold/olive color and the length is good. i could have sized up for extra length but thought there was too much fabric in body. for reference-5'8". slender. love the diagonal cable pattern and curved design. the sleeves are more comfortable for me pushed up a little but if left long works well and are about wrist length. the color is great for fall but could easily transition into winter.spring. the gray is a lighter gray and is nice  too  but size xs not availab
I love the way this looks on me! definitely flattering on curvy/full-figured girls. i am a 36-38c and bought an xl - i don't like things that are too tight or that cling to the wrong areas. if they had xl in other sizes  i would buy it in every color. can be dressed up or down. i'm very happy with this purchase.
I love how boho  colorful and comfy this dress is. sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesn't cover the straps. they were out of the petite small so i went with the small. i am 5' 125 lbs  and it fits perfectly  just more of a midi length. no problemo!
As other reviewers have noted  the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans  but otherwise is unflattering.  also  the color is described as black  but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult  but if able to  i would have returned it.
I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur
This is such a fun happy dress. i saw it in the store on the rack that has online returns so there was only one available to try on. it was a size 4 and i usually wear a 6 in retailer brands. i loved the dress and tried it anyway and it fit perfectly which is why i think it runs a bit large. ( for reference  i am 5'2" and 140 lbs.  hourglass shape but a bit fluffy in the tummy and upper arms.) it has an empire waistline and a zipper in the back. it is so light and airy and super comfortable. it ha
I would give it a 3.5 if half star possible. like other reviews said  the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on. overall  nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down. i am 5'8"  155lbs  36b and m is a little snug for me on the top.
I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich  deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy  festive  cozy  and warm.
Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso  and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that  the material is a very good qu
I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3  123 lbs.  34-d. it's going back.
A little long but very comfortable. i've worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile.
This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.
Love the design  material  and color...the sizing as listed is waaaaay off (running small). returned to store (after purchase online) 3 times to get one that fits  which was at least generally easy :o
I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful  fit is impeccable  no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3" 120 lbs and ordered the small.
These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size  but seem to stretch  so buy a size down. trust me  it will work.
I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store  so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in  meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are
This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this  but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.
You won't break the bank with this cute tee. loved that it's not a thin fabric. the variation in the stripes adds interest  too. i ordered a large  my regular size  and it fit well. i returned because it was a bit on the long side on my short frame  the colors didn't suit me and i need long sleeve tees now that we're heading into the colder months.
Nice practical tank  that i can wear with everything. but  the fabric is kind of weird - overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes. i would still recommend it  but just know it's not just a cotton tank.
Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline  but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.
What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t
I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup  beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs  but it does not. unfortunately  this one is
You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
Love this dress! i've been looking for a nice nursing friendly dress for a while and this one is perfect! its so soft and hangs nicely. its very versatile and can be worn for multiple seasons. i ordered a size small which fits nicely  but could have done an xs or small petite. (for reference  i am 5'2"  118 lbs).
I was a little apprehensive about getting this dress without any reviews  but i am really glad i did. first  it looks exactly as pictured  maybe even more beautiful. the material is nice and flowing  and very light  so it's going to make a fantastic summer dress. there are two layers- an under layer which can be completely detached from the pink silk top layer.  the reason why i say true to size is that even though the pink silk layer is pretty loose  the bottom layer conforms more your body. i'
I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning
I love peasant shirts so wanted to try it. cute top  but v-neck was lower than i was expecting. i have to wear an undershirt under this for that and also because of sheerness. fyi- shirt is off-white so stark white cami didn't work. was struggling to find something  but have the leana v-neck in navy- worked perfect and follows neckline exactly. now really cute! need something not long sleeves to wear under for spring weather here  but will keep and try to figure it out. 5'4  135 lbs  ordered xs.
I am so glad i found this tee. as usual i love bordeaux rayon-spandex shirts. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it's heavy enough to drape nicely contouring your natural curves. it does not cling to the body  is just loose enough to let you breathe during the hot summer days. i was afraid it would look like a swing tee and make me look like i am pregnant but it doesn't. it runs true to size. the only complaint i have is that the back runs too long.
I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...
Picked this darling vest in a medium. i have been eyeing for sometime but really did not want to pay full price  after checking other manufactures i came back to this vest at retailer. as the other reviewers mentioned  the softness  spec of colors which enables you to wear the vest with so many colors in bottoms and tops; the pockets  the belt  which i love as much as the pockets  though the faux fur collar i do wish was removable. the faux fur will limit me in getting away with wearing this vest
I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!
I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color  it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size  so for comfort i went with my usual size.
The sweater is cute  but scratchy.
This sweater is beautiful but runs big. i got the xs (5'3"  110lbs) and it's very roomy. i love the thickness  the color  the pockets  and even the roominess except for the sleeves. they are very long and very wide  which makes it look bulky. if sleeves were slimmer it would look like a cute intentionally oversized style- instead i look like a kid who borrowed a giant sweater. i think it would work better on a taller  slim person. but i still like it.
This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!
Beautiful top  loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from  hanging at store or the way it was sewn.
I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.  it runs a little big  so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side  but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.
I love rifle paper  and when i saw this dress online  i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate  and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that "baby doll dress" fit to it  but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.
Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.
Although i am small (size xs on top  27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.
Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt  and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be.
I am a size  14  and tall.  i was afraid that it would be too short.  the sales clerk grabbed a large   and it fit! it's airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back.  the big surprise?  pockets! love it!
Bought the camel color and love it. nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall. soft and comfortable. delicate yet not too much so that you wouldn't wear often.
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer  and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly  but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money  i could get it tailored  but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!
I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work  but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes  (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes  but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white  but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small  which fit great.
Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3" shorter  considering alterations. i'm 5'7" the model is 5'10"  so yeah 3" shorter would be cute!
The prima is soft and silky. they fit true to size  maybe a little tight in the waist. while the color is more of a wine it looks nice with a lot of my fall blouses and sweaters. you will be pleased with this purchase.
I ordered the black and it was a soft black  which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer  but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.
Love this top! so soft and sweet! only complaint is that it's a bit short and a tad boxy for my 5'9" 140#  frame (i also have boobs  so that doesn't help the fit of this piece).  going to tuck in the front into high waisted jeans! keeping it!
I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater  which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.
I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.
Just a little scallop makes this top special.   if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up.   fabric crisp-well made and worth full price
I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut  but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.
I wanted to love this top. the neckline made it look strange on me. if i untied it  it looked sloppy. so  it went back. i love the print though.
I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed  and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however  i ordered it before reviews started popping up  and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however  when it arrived  the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust  but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6  and the 6 was great in this dress  and a perfectly joyful length--appropr
I love this tunic. the fit is just lovely for me--i'm a large busted  muscular shouldered woman who wears a 4-6 on the bottom. the 8 fit perfectly across my chest (34ddd) without horrid  gaping armpits. and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in front--not easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl! i also love the cut and flow--it is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels  but also cute with flat sandals for a day o
I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute  flattering  and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this "baby doll" style  you'll love this.
I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design  the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs. they weren't my size  but  to my surprise they could be ordered in my size  still at the sale price.  the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them.
Unlike other reviews  i did not have a problem with the seam. this is a cute shirt that can be dressed up or down.
Great fit  very soft fabric  and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
Dress is made from a light-weight linen and is lined with a separate slip. high quality with nice details and tts. sleeves are average length. length of dress feels appropriate on my 5'8" frame. hook-and-eye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail. i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play.
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt
I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.
I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret
The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
Maybe i'm hanging out with my grandson too much because this appealed to the kid in me!  looks great under a jean jacket and under a leather jacket - oh  and cool under a silk bomber jacket as well.
The fit was fine  but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted  i'm fair skinned  but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.
The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
What a great piece. so unique and so cool and made with high quality textiles. i expect this to be in heavy rotation. can go super casual/luxe with leather joggers or upscale with nice jeans and some heels.
This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone. pairs amazing with leather boots and hat
I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable  and made of a nice  soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!
These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.    however  very nice jean once again from pilcro.
I loved the look and feel of this shirt the moment i saw it. it would be so versatile with jeans  skirts  and black slacks. i was contemplating wearing it with a tulle skirt for nye but it wasn't meant to be. usually my issue with these tops is in the bust and strangely that wasn't the case this time. this is great news!! also they made the sides adjustable so wide hips are not a problem either. however i have muscular arms and well cloth and stone are not thinking about that. they make the uppe
The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
Love this shirt. the print is a little loud  but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however  that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty  if that helps. the red is short-sleeved  by the way if ordered online  cute and flattering.
This tee is cute  keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it's huge. i ordered an xxs and it's very loose and drapey  which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also  a totally sheer  basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way.
This shirt is very attractive! i tried on my usual size 2 and it fits like a glove. i wish they had more colors than ivory  but i couldn't pass up the unique fit and design of this shirt.
This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.
This sweater is amazing. color is vibrant. quality is high. but i have a super long torso and it fell short on me. if you are shorter this will be amazing. sad to send it back.
I have been wanting this skirt since it came out  and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist  xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses)  but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy so there's no way i could wear a 0  but the skirt hugs my butt. and i'm talking in that weird "hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way". now i don't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department  but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can'
I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three! the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique. the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and it's a great color for summer. i'm waiting for the white to arrive and hope it's actually white and not ivory  as retailer colors are sometime a little off. i'm petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream. not too tight or loose  super comfortable and flattering. easy to pair with white  khaki 
I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large  but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.
I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings  but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
Bought on a whim  on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"  and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh  and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa  i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them
This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch  the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all  so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality  i would definitely look into other items from this brand  but back this dress went.
This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk  but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high  almost to the hip. i am 5'1" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it  the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo
I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring  or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side  it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad  but i will definitely have to
I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w
Saw on my way out of the store and had to try them on. they are very comfortable and surprisingly cute. the jogger style usually doesn't flatter my curvier body but these have a drape to the fabric that made them look so much nicer. i took in two sizes  my usual small and a medium since i just had my second child and still have some post baby weight. i still went with the small after trying on both though. the medium was a bit too big and shapeless. the small was comfortable and looked better. t
I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit  especially online!      this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.       the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.
I had really high hopes for this dress  and i am still unsure if i'll keep it or not. i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand. the small fit (i"m usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b  140 lb  5'8") just like it does on the model  only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress. this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly. also  the colors should be more like "blue multi" because there's a bright a
Great fit  can be dressy or casual  goes with everything  i adore tis jacket!
Really beautiful top. i agree with the others  a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones  but i'm going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up.
I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6" and 110 lbs  slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!
I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception. the fabric is heavy but soft  the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations. they are comfortable and flattering. i am 5'2" and these are not crops on me  with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me.
I'm 5'3" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped.
A seasonal must have. nicely made. medium weight. cozy. buttons to half way down. i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath. highly recommend.
This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
This shirt seemed to run really small  especially in the chest. i'm debating exchanging for a new size bc this was really cute but i'm not sure if i need to go up 1 or 2 sizes it was so tight
This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!
These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.
Adorable fall dress. but it runs huge -- i'm an hourglass 8 or 10 usually and the 6 fit best in the top and full skirt (36d  30 waist) but sadly each size the sleeves get like 2 inches shorter. since these are blouses sleeves they look off. so sad bc this dress is adorable otherwise. if you always find sleeves too long for you  snap up this gem  this is for you!
This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..
Wow  this dress is so incredibly designed and made! the style is a subtle showstopper - classic and beautiful like they don't make anymore. the inside of the dress is so well constructed  it has its own beauty!  i read that it ran a little large  so i tried the 0 and the 00  since i usually wear a 0. well the 00 looked like a lingerie commercial with the dress unable to zip above the waist!! the 0 fit and zipped  but i could not sit down comfortably. yikes! the 2 was a winner. i'm 5'4 1/2"  110
I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on  i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering  comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard  and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit  the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose  and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it's act
I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
Love this dress  it's comfortable  and it can be worn casualties or formally.
This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture  but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.
Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d  and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.
I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.
These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front  which i don't like  as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen  they will require frequent ironing (which  i hate to do in the summer).
I loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered. the length was good for me (only 5'4"). the elastic top fit well (32b) but then from there it was too much fabric. i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me...several inches on both sides big. i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf
Fell in love at first site  cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure.
Love these jeans!!! they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles. their first wear was like i'd been wearing them for years. i paired them with the pintuck button-down tunic.
So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.
I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.
This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!
I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.
I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.
I really liked this little cardigan. so simple  light weight  and comfy. i have grabbed it and put it on 3 times the first week i got it.
The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty  though
I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to
This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.
I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't  it is very heavy  much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice  the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance  easily. back it went  boo hoo. if you are between sizes  i would size down  runs a bit big.
As much as i had wanted this to work for me  it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way  did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric  go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.
Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur. it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft   rich and just adorable  it can be dressed up or down  perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts. the fabric is soft but substantial . the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little. a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic. i chose my typical medium and fits perfect . 34 dd chest for reference. sale price plus promo made this a winner. i
I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!
I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of "genie" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle  but the worst is the fabric. its "old lady" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim  and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping.
The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture  it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans  or dressing down something fancier.
I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type  just not mine. i'm 5'5  125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls  very tall girls or curvy on the
I love these pants. they are very flattering and comfy  and look like real leather. they are also machine washable which is great. i've worn mine 5 times already.
Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
I really like this dress. it is cute  but not too frilly. i purchased in the store and they only had a petite (i am 5'6"  so not a petite)  but it fit - a little short but not too crazy. can be dressed up or down. the material and the print are really lovely.
I am tall (5'11 and 3/4) and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio. i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them. i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be. however there was no need to alter these tops (making me think the tops typically run small).     both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b
One of the most comfortable tops i own. fits loose  such a soft fabric. looks cute. love it!
I saw this and was hoping to try it so i went to the closest retailer.. the design of this dress is fantastic but if you have curvy hips this is going to cause you problems. i am 32c-24-35... i have a definite curve between my waist and hips and it totally interfered with the line of the dress. i think if you are straighter between your waist and hips or you are long waisted then this lovely dress is for you. the waist line was simply too long. i needed the dress to flare out higher. the to
I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso  the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.
They were fine. i had hoped they'd be more like begging a though... more structure. they were very much just leggings and rather unflattering in the crotch area. they felt well made though. might work for someone else. not a bad legging.
These pants fit true to size. i have a small waist and curvy hips  and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie  these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg. the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall. the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points. i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea
I normally wear a large to medium but due to other reviews i ordered a med and could've worn a small. i still love it and i'm so glad i ordered.
I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture   but still very cute.
Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.
I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.
Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.
I bought this tank in gold  and the color is a beautiful ochre. i love the length and the side slits  which elevates the tunic from a simple basic. the material is good quality and very comfortable. i'm hoping to get a lot of wear out of this purchase.
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
As other reviewers have noted  this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas  however  it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it  sadly.
Never thought i would buy a jumpsuit  but this one is gorgeous. i put true to size. i ordered a m and a l. i kept the l because i like the looser fit. weigh 150# and am 5' 6 1/2" tall. i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better. i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes. love the feel of it and the way it looks on me. really looking forward to wearing it. on sale it is a great buy.
I am a 32dd  5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
I'm 5'9" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.
I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.
I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy  however  they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam  but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed.
I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
Cute  basic top. it has really great detail at the top and it is a good length (it is not super long/too short). it does billow out a bit at the bottom  so i would size down (this is what i did after reading the previous reviews). i do not think i would have paid full price for this top  but on sale  it is a great deal and a nice addition to your wardrobe.
Ugh  i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique  but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling  the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
This top will be great in 3 seasons. i can wear it alone in summer to dress up and with a blazer or sweater in fall and winter. the velvet is beautiful and luxurious without being excessive or too much. it's very soft and comfortable on the skin  although a little larger than i expected. i ordered my usual size small and probably should have gone down a size.
This tee was meant to be loose and swishy  but as it runs large  sizing down means the sides come up really high  as they curve a good 3-4" higher up. so your waistband is exposed  and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.
What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise  i am
I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.
I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped.   it is very pretty but once on  it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust.   the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter  but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd)  however  i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also  the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.
For a now feel  that comfy and well made  this was a great choice!
This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures  but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy  but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so  perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally  and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note  the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the
Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution
I was so excited about this top  super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold  hand wash  air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
This dress is quite adorable - the pattern  slip and bottom lace trim are very nice. i found that this ran large  particularly in the bust. i am a 34c and felt that the xs was still a bit too big. i decided to pass due to the fit and the price  but i will re-visit if it makes it to the sale room. also note that the front buttons are purely decorative  and can't be buttoned to tighten the top up.
Online  i like the design  the leaves stand out. in-person  the leaves don't stand out as much  you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame  i think. it was just too light and thin for me.
Modern  unique  versatile; love it paired with the essential culottes. usually size 4/small but got the xs  otherwise the armholes dipped down too low as did the back hem of the sweater (
These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b
This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.     the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.
I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).
The pattern is pretty subtle  almost looks like one color  so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought. the fabric is so soft  the collar is removable  but i love the look with it on. the way it closes is 3 lobster-like clasps  so you can wear it closed or open. sizing is a bit big  as in the xxs p fit me perfectly (didn't even try on the xs p. this will keep me warm  and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress... recommend (sizing reference: 115 lbs  30dd  26
The fabric felt beautiful  and it felt great on  but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
This is a really nice dress for the money. i definitely had to size down. i've always taken a 4 in hd in paris tops  so i initially ordered a 4. but it was a little too big in the chest area. (i wear a 32dd so normally this isn't my issue.) i replaced it with a 2 and it fits great. i also have a long torso  which can be an issue for me with dresses. but this one works on me! this is definitely a good dress for taller girls. the material is high quality too. i'm going to wear it to my friend's we
When i tell people i invested in a "horse sweater" i don't get a lot of encouraging comments  but when they see it they understand. so cute  different  and cozy for cold days (winter is long where i live). really works as both a sweater and as a coat.
Really cute and comfortable. i can wear it to work for a casual friday  or out on the weekend. a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer!
I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer. material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year. if you are all tall  the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6" and the waist just barely hits my waistline. doubt i would have purchased this item full price  but on sale it's a great deal.
I had a really  really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it  i wanted to love it! in theory  it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however  as you can see for yourself in the photo  this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back
If you want it  buy it now. this dress is everything and then some. love it. i bought two  the neutral (black) and the turquoise. the turquoise one is a very retro print  i am getting many compliments. they are so comfortable and flattering. i'm all about this price point retailer. more please!
Nice sweater  just did not look good on me. sorry  going back.
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?
Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch
For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse  a mix of various floral swatches  is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!
I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
...a little long still  but loved the fit. flattering on me  i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect. color (wash) was also very nice in my opinion. can be wrn with any top  really  i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price  but on my wish list for sure!
I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite
After a rough day at the office  i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy. i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on. though it's more than i normally like to spend  it was well worth the price. material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work. fit is spot on (i have wider hips and a smaller waist  which typically makes me a size 12 and that's what i bought). the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors 
This is a beautiful dress! i bought the red color in petite and love it. i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear. i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isn't what it was.
Ordered this in the neutral motif  size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute  but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length  not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9"). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also  the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls
Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!
Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store  and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l  yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!
These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!
What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 34 c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short  as i am long waisted  but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out.
This is the most perfect tunic out there. it is comfy  flattering and fits perfect. it can be dressed up or dressed down. definitely worth it to buy in every color!
I initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory. as other reviewers have said  it's not the softest sweater you'll try on. if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model  you may need to size down. while i love the style  it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so i've been careful getting it on and off. i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale. the quality is of the yarn is just of
This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to  but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.
Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut  wish there were more color options.
I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
On the hanger  this dress looks a bit boxy  however once on  it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured  and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.
This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper
I got this in a petite xs; it's gorgeous and incredibly soft  great quality as well. my one little caveat is that it's very short; i'm 5'1 with a short torso and it still didn't get very far on me  but if you wear it with high-waited pants/skirt it's not a big deal
Comfortable  relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
Do not waste your money on this.  at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.   fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.  still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees  it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"  135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.
I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.
This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model  but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top  and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.
I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense   saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides  however  it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side  which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection  and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t
Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"  135  size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"  130  size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped  all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter  looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.
I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme
Everyone should have this blouse  amazing! simply love it! it does run large  so purchase down 1-2 sizes.
Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green  so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes  the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6  and this one the 8 fit perfectly  so maybe one size up.
I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.
I purchased this on a whim and i'm so glad i did. this is a gorgeous piece. fabric is soft very feminine and stylish. quality is outstanding. it can be worn with a dress or jeans. lovely shades of pink and soft gray. i live in florida  so it's a bit heavy for hotter weather  but will be great on a cool spring day. love it!
I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately  this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
First of all  the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms  honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also  with one important exception  the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent   which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown  in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
I am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much. i personally like that it looks a tad retro. length is shorter  but not mini or too short. i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me (and i am older). the colors are fun and appropriate for fall  or winter  the sparkle (golden thread) can bring this dress into the holiday season (and beyond). i love the turtleneck part  only thing is it is really high  and the embroidery gets a little lost in it (top of the design) feel is thick  no
I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
The flower print really caught my eye. i like the unique twisted neckline. there is a lot of material here  but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops.
I bought the blue dress  though the "blue" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.    i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge)  but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.     i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual  which is what i wanted  but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.
This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
This dress is gorgeous  but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.
Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.  they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh
These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)  would highly recommend them.
I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.
This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin  light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.
I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a
Although the fabric and color is beautiful   the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.
Great material  creative design... luckily i am small-busted and will be able to get away with nothing underneath. the closure/knotting on back is innovative. a sexy jumper
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
The turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans  khaki shorts  and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!
I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short  and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.
Great summer pants.....nice material  easy to take care of. i'm 5'6" and usually wear a size 29  which i purchased the neutral. they might be a little bit loose  but they fit great  and best of all  they truly are slimming. i love them so much that i just ordered the green.......hard to top the sale price
May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.
I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8"). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!
I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect  which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought  but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!
I ordered the geometric  blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately  it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting  bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference  i'm 5'4" 120lbs 34 a.
A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure  this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.  i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta  but definitely needed a large.  i ordered the "lavender" color  which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead.
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.
I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so  fresh out of the package  the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now  it's still a wee boxy  of course  but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so  i'm keeping. even thinki
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.
I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe
This is a super cute romper--very casual  very comfortable. i feel it runs a bit big because i tried on an xs (i'm usually a small 4-6). it fit perfectly except for the inseam on the legs. i am 5' 8.5" tall but mostly legs (as opposed to being long waisted). i wear a 33" inseam with flats. if the bottom of the legs were not elasticized  i could have just gone with a cropped look or rolled them  etc. but the elastic was digging into my calves after just five minutes. i think it might be very unco
This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.
I ordered a size small. i am 5'7" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high  so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft  thick  stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.
The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.
This gorgeous sky blue sweater was already in the dressing room to try on; i was not shopping for anything like this whatsoever. well  i tried it on and decided it was a must-buy. i usually need a petite in sweaters and coats  but this one  because i prefer a longer length  fits just fine  and the sleeves are not too long. the color is beautiful. it seems to be warm enough for sf evenings. it think the price is quite reasonable for a sweater/coat like this. a great purchase!
This shirt is awesome. i absolutely love the style of this shirt! it's super flowy  and is a really breathable fabric. i've been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants. the only downside is the quality of material. it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills. it also feels like it's going to start falling apart at the arm seams. nonetheless  i adore the shirt  and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season! no
Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist  this won't fit well. too bad  because it's super cute  if a bit sheer.
I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!  really retailer? i know you can do better than that...
This t-shirt is perfect for summer. light  breezy & easy. i'm 5'4.5"  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. the front and the arms fit like a t-shirt  which means it looks busty for me. but that's how t-shirts always are for me. the back has something extra and that's the reason i'm keeping it.
This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.
This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however  i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.
I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually "just a raincoat". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i wouldn't go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute
Bought this for my 21 year old daughter  and she loves it. the blue color is very pretty and she says she gets lots of compliments and requests to "touch it" because the fabric is gorgeous. it's a bit boxy  and a little short to wear as a dress for her 5'9" height - she says she risks showing her undies when she raises her arms. but she likes is so much she's just keeping her arms down. :-)
This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s  which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long  even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me  but on it is very flattering.
This is a simple design  but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding.  this dress is great for hourglass shapes  but it does not hide your features.
I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan
Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the "outside" middle material  hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.
Fit is just like stet in my opinion.
I received these pants  but they are not as pictured  see the photo of the back pockets  there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received. i'm not sure about these  the quality is nice  but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered 2 sizes down.
This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not  so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts  especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute  ver
I love this skirt for so many reasons!   one  it isn't a circle skirt  per se  which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt  the description states that it's a-line. based on that  i was willing to risk it. also  i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.
Gorgeous pattern and colors for autumn. maeve does me good when it comes to maxi dresses. i have to say that the sizing is all over the place! i am generally a medium  but the small and xs (?!) fit me well also. the stretchiness of the jersey is very comfortable and forgiving  except at the ruched waistband  which took longer to stretch out  but it did eventually. i do need to hem if i want to wear flats  but the length works for my higher heels. there are pockets and a lining to my knees. i am
The style and color is very nice but the fabric is a bit stiff. the fabric doesn't have much give and isn't as comfortable as most of my other retailer t shirts. still a cute top for the cooler weather.
I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect 
This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo! i was instantly attracted to it! upon trying on  i was surprised at how soft the fabric was. definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise! i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else! i can't wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top!! i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top!!
Swing dresses are the holy grail of comfort. whatever's going on underneath doesn't matter because you're all arms and legs and billowy fun and this dress doesn't disappoint. beautiful  light and silky fabric with a pattern and color palate that can easily work all spring  summer and into the fall with some layers. a great  unique dress!
These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.
This dress is super cute  flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i'll get lots of wear out of it.
The fabric  so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern  so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple  yellow  orange  green  they're all in there. but here's the but....    i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me  i look like i'm wearing a sack  or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest  too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves  while adding
Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra  but after 3 kids  braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said  the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely  and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so  this one is going back.
I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side  but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). i like the regular size because the l
This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great  i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall  it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.
I just received this in the mail today  it is very cute however it will be going back  if you look at the picture of the back it look like there is only one opening however below the knot there is another opening 
I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey  but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly  i will be returning this top.
I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift. it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too.
I have gotten constant compliments on this dress and it is very flattering. i normally wear a large or a size 12 and i had to order this in an xl. i am big busted so that makes the difference.    this could be so easily dressed up but easily made casual with a denim jacket or sweater.    one of my favorite fall purchases.
I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt
This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
In that i'm on the busty-side  i thought  "surely an xl will not be too large." ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway  so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket.
The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid  it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!
I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm  but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly  which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.
Let me start off by saying that i really do like this sweater. the texture is very nice and  if it does start to pill  the material is one where i don't think it'll show up much (the fabric is a little "bumpy"  but still soft).  i'm only giving it 4 stars because the sleeves could be 2 to 3 inches longer. i bought this sweater in both the red and tan colors (medium) i liked it so much. i've also never had a problem with long sleeve shirts/sweaters from retailer having overly short sleeves. however
This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.
Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.
I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....
I love this tee but it isn't for everyone. i am usually a solid medium & i tried on both xs/s. i went w the small bc i liked the volume.  for reference  i'm 5'6" and wear a medium/size 8-10.     not thinking this is for small petite women as the peplum hem is poplin  not tee knit material so it holds its shape. on my frame it was so cute. got the holly color.
Went to the chicago michigan ave location and found this gem in the "take a peek" section... i think that's what it's called.  anyway... been looking for a plane white top to wear with a red lace pencil skirt and this fit the bill! wore it today with a grey midi skirt and sneakers and looks adorable!  it does flare a little and makes me feel like i'm wearing a maternity top but i don't care i love it!  went back to another retailer location and purchased the lilac one! can't wait to wear that one
I cannot wait for summer!    when i received this item i felt the same as the other reviewers. it may be a little pricey for the material.  then i tried it on.  i love it. just add some accessories and let's go!
I second that above review who states "worst blouse i've ever ordered"
I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
I love  love this trench! i bought the grey  and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!    it does run a little big  but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!    hei hei consistently makes great jackets/trenches :)
I wanted to love this dress. the wool is lightweight yet warm and drapes beautifully. the plaid print is rich  however it is much darker in color than shown in the photos. the dress runs very large. i ordered it in my typical size and it was too big. dolman sleeve dresses usually look great on me  but the cut of this dress  while beautiful  was nothing remarkable. for as expensive as it is it would have had to be an amazing dress for me to keep it. sadly it didn't quite make the cut. it's a sham
Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.
I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s  so i went with a medium. fortunately for me  this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large  i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality  the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!
I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun  uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said  there are two issues i wish i had known about  although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also  the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5")  it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter  the sleeves are huge  the neckline was falling off my shoulder  i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes.
This top is a classic subtle sexy top  great for casual wear and especially to go on a date. the hem of the sleeves have a slit  neat detail. small fit me well width wise but sleeves are too long (2 in. pass my wrist) but i cannot roll them up because the bell shape does not hold and i cannot hem them because they would lose the original stitching (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist). no petite size so i passed. cloth and stone is better in making petite size but not for most items  sad for us shorties.
Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small  like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up  fits perfectly!
Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.
I bought these in my standard 27 (on sale  woop).  they are super comfortable with a bit of stretch for those days when you need a little extra room.  the ankles are easily cuffed and look great with ankle boots.  my only qualm is that they run a bit big and tend to gape in the back.  i love a higher rise jean and these are a great option but i'd lean towards sizing down.
Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.
I really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.
Very feminine  fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.
I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.
I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full
Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern  however  the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.
This is a very cute tunic  but it is slit so high on the sides. i really like the fit  but i think i'm going to return it because it is slit so high.
These pants are very  very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.
I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality  but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+
I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
Like others  i was drawn to the collar  fabric and overall look to it....  ________  pros:  - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.  - collar is so classy  but i am drawn to anything with a collar.  - pockets are a nice touch.  _______  cons:  - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.  - runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
I love wearing this so much! i wear it with leggings  jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have. i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss. i got them before they went on sale for fear they'd be out of my size. i am very happy with my purchase! i highly recommend.
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
This top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.
I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer.
This reminds me a bit of a vintage tennis sweater: wide-rib  v-neck; loose-fitting. nice creamy cotton blend. size was a bit hard to gauge. this sweater is long (lower hip length) and has dolman sleeves  so it has a quite roomy fit. however  i ordered the xs/s (my normal size)  and it is scaled proportionately  so the fit is true.
I love this blouse on the model online. however  i couldn't get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me. did not like the glittery thread.
I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit  great color  so comfortable! however  i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so  now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable.     i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference  see my stats. i bought a 26.
This dress is super soft  beautiful on  perfect fit!
This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color  perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.  fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in
This sweater is so cute and classic and i've gotten so many compliments it's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend
I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer  no but still a nice dress:)
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.
This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
I love the pattern and shape of this top. i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals. nice fabric and fit.
I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite  but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated  and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31" from the shoulder seam to the hem  not 36" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely  but i just can't
I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top  so i wen
The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin  kind of scratchy & has  almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as  movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!
Dress appears to be slim fit  but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"  but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings  memorials  special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed.
This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable  breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love  although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white  which is fine  but that did surprise me a little. overall  i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.
This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because  despite how much i liked the style  it just wasn't flattering on my body type.
I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit! i am post-baby (six weeks) and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size. and it will only get better!   the quality and color are great!
The design of this dress is very cute  but if you have an average to large bust  don't even think about it. returned  unfortunately.
I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture  which makes it more interesting.
I absolutely love this dress. beautiful  flattering shape with flowing light weight fabric. i'm so in love with this color. a great dress for a special night.
I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly  it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer  colors are brighter/better in person.
The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.
Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however  that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it.
Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture  but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.
...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print  colors  and design. however  i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it  the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.
I do recommend this dress with some caveats. 1: it'll be difficult to find a bra that won't show straps  and 2: it's very figure flattering so if you're body conscious  particularly tummy
I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.
Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also  as has happened to me before  retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.
This dress looks cute online  but it is enormous. i bought a small  but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on  just in case  and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.
This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.
I wasn't sure how this would look on  but it is very flattering. looks great with leggings or jeans! i have received many complements!
Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything  i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!
I did not find this blouse to be tight in the arms or chest. (i'm a 34a though so maybe that is why?) i also don't have a problem with it being too short in front. i took my usual size 0. i like the feel of the fabric and the prints are great. the only thing i slightly dislike is the flowy bottom of the shirt. i wish it was more fitted and that is why i took one star off. i got the cat print. the cat faces are white and on random faces there are pink ears or a pink nose.or a winking eye - just a
I loved the pattern  color and mock turtleneck style of this top  but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5"  32d  110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work  but every time i raised my arms  you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also  and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s
I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.
Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering  really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.
I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it "work"  lastly the
This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even  and maybe especially  because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire  which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size  but might run a tad lar
I love these jeans  but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.
There are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right now-this is not one of my favorites. while the color is amazing  the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way. the are very close together which is hard to button up. the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hour-glass shape. however  sizing down (which would also fix this problem) would cause the shoulder/arm area to be too tight.
I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.
Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer  this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my "art shirt." the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big  so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great.
Tried the xs on in store from an online return  loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned  it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned  the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.
So happy i purchased this - it's a gorgeous piece  and perfect for fall and winter. the colors are soft and beautiful  and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet.
I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.
I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now  i need more colors...
Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro  make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist  just prefer that better  but i think if you can pull of the waist look  go for it! would buy more in different colors!
I liked the product shots of this cardigan  but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting  the fabric was rougher  the lace was scratchy  the fit was boxy  and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute  but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale  but for now it goes back...
A wonderfully heavy weight piece  opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer  this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck  which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!
Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip  but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.
I had reservations about this top based on other reviews  but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin  but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.
Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft  and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.
This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic  soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece   but the pink detail on the trim  along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.
I loved the fabric  cut and style of these shirts  the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully.   please make again   maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic  a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker.   sill i love this top
I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color  soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters  so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants  the sli
I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on
Got the black but the orange it very pretty too the black fabric has a sheen to it; almost like snakeskin. as other reviewers have mentioned  it does run small and the armholes are cut in a bit. overall it is a more interesting than a basic lbd.
If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.
This is a cute top although it runs fairly large. i have washed it once and the fray did ok; however  i'm a bit concerned about how the shirt will wash over time with the frayed edges.
Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.
Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference  i'm 5'5  120lbs & ordered the sp & xs  i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist  there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.
I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material  this did not happen! this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn't last.
This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1  108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.
This top is so fun  but more importantly  it is sooooo soft and comfortable!!
The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.
Love the style of this dress (length  hem  waist details  material)! i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around. it doesn't give the entire waist definition  which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist. this is a pretty unique dress  which is one of the reasons i liked it. i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps. unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea
This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however  it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side  but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale  so i am keeping it.
First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.
The color and fit of this dress is fabulous. i can't wait to wear it out.. casual with flats or dressy with heels. love it!
I bought the size 27 in these - i'm usually a 27 or 28 (measurements 27-38)  and they fit perfectly. i'm more of a pear shape and they're very flattering. the moss color is lovely and will go with a lot  and they can be dressed up or down.
Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however  like others have commented  it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.
I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through  but if you didn't like that  you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!
I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great  the tie dye is very unique love it!
Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.
I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through  that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach  you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything  it's just on the shorter side  especially if you have a longer t
These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
I have this suit in the "tile" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the "mint" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the "v" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result  my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad  because the
Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress  just beware it runs very large.
The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.
Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this  and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out  as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well.
I was looking for an off-the-shoulder top and chose this one. it is pretty. the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy  so i can only wear with skinny pants. takes a little getting use  somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms.
I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight   and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large  as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this
I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"
This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.
I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them.
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.
I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however  if you are chesty  this piece shows off more than i was comfy with  and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body  i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top  the xs showed much too much cleavage.  (34d  5'  115).  i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
Very nice soft fabric  has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in   sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.
This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual  t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely  and it's very feminine. i got the light blue color  and can't wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!
If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.
This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size  the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it  too  is defective
It took a minute  but once i figured out how to wear this  i loved it. it is meant to be oversized  and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"  curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick  high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the "cowl" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold  which works well for
I really  really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however  it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress  i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.
I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however  like many tops lately  it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
I like the idea of the dress  just not the fit in the bust. i'm not particularly big (32c)  but it just didn't fit up there. i wish the dress had built in support because you can't really wear a bra.
I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11"  slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts. the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the
I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model  but it was a cropped length on me :(
So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it  i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing  the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l  so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug  but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look  so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too  but i could have rolle
There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt  but thought ti wasn't special enough  don't get me wrong  it fits nicely  and is comfortable  but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly  26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt  the sale price is a good fir for the skirt  just wasn't enough for me :-)
I tried these on at my local retailer  and was like  no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas  i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean  have a distressed look  without being fragile. and yet they are so soft  so comfortable  you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch  but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect  in that you can wear them with boots  san
Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.
I could live in these jeans  they are so comfortable. they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft. i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and i'm yanking on them all day  however  i have worn them 3 days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist. i am normally a 28  but can get away with 27 sometimes; i chose the 28 and felt the fit was perfect. by the way  i'm wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots 
Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather
I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.
These pants are so perfect  i bought 3 pairs. perfect for casual friday's  a night out or the weekend.
This is a comfortable sweater dress  and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly  they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.
Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts  and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!
So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off  but then i decided to try it on (the regualar) size in store to keep in mind for my next binge :-).  the cut is flattering  length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one. i would  as others have mentioend  wear it with a belt. overall it fits like a nice comfy t-shirt with comfy skirt  but as a dress  very nice.
I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs  however  i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.
This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
Perfect fall top! extra long sleeves perfect for keeping the chill off.
Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.
I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints  i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on  but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p  but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.
I love this top. lovely  light  airy material  though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame  but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also  this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!
I bought this in green and i absolutely love it! the quality of material is very fantastic  a durable fabric that will hold up well over time. its a good quality too  so can be dressed up somewhat  and also does well as a very casual piece. love it!
The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip  and the length is spot on  but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.  will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.
Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it
As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me  i tried it in a small  medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2"  145lbs  36d. the dress is really pretty in person  but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9"  100lbs  34a  also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline  however the neckline is not open like in the picture  it's more pushed toget
Im 5'1" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.
I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared  but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf  skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!
This blouse in the purple motif is lovely. unfortunately for me  it runs small.
I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not
I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece  when i spotted this very attractive  well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium  true to size; i am an 8 top  5'1"130#  34f. although i largely buy online  sometimes you ju
The material is structured enough to flatter the body. only concern was over time the straps may wither as they are thin. very happy with the style and comfort of this jumpsuit. pockets on side are also useful yet discreet.
I thought this was so cute online  sweet and feminine  but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted  even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet  dusted it off and said  ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)
With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha
I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter's name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable  yet flattering. it's a must have. now i want to get this in black!
I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.
I saw this dress in the store  there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver  the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person  especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference  i am 5'2"  34b  120 lbs  usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses  i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely  but it is kind of itchy 
This dress fitted me like a glove. i ordered the size 4  at 5ft7 and 130lbs  it was perfect though i could not weigh two pounds more. i cannot wait to wear it  it has that wow thing going for it  very good quality too.
I had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online. however  it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris. for the price  the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.
Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!
Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist  creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.   why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time
Dress cut was great  but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age.
This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.
This is a nice sweater  it is comfortable and a great top layer. it fits tts but be aware that when you raise your arms it rides up pretty high. i bought the grey/brown option. i find it to be more brown than grey.
I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8" and slender  but with a 36' bust  and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit  but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re
I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the
Bought a pair of these with a gift card i got for my birthday.  just ordered another pair!  i love them for everyday use and working out
Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway  i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.
So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0
This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy  seems well made and fit nicely. but  although it fit technically  i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all.     the suit is kind of a neoprene material  so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit  so i think even though it isn't lined  it might not be see-through  but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit  i think it
This dress is very comfortable and casual  but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.
Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"  135 lbs  an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.
Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy  shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
Very cozy wrap!  the material is so soft.   find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night.  i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too!  and with the arm holes it stays on.  very pleased.
This is as pretty in person as it is online  good quality (except one item i'll get to)  and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"  normally a medium/8  and the medium fit great in this top.  i almost kept this shirt...so close  i had it on a hanger  but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online  but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on  my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)...
I love this dress! it was a tad long ( i'm a shorty) but i loved the cut and versatility of the material/ design that i took it to the tailor. now it is perfect! i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling. love.
Fun top for day or evening.
I wore this immediately after receiving it as a gift. after wearing it for almost 2 hours the fabric started to pill between my legs where it rubs. sucks!! i actually really love this jumper and it's very soft and comfortable. just wish it would last longer :( i'm going to be wearing this all the time this summer but i'm pretty sure it will rub to the point where there will be holes in my pants... between my legs..     only complaint about sizing is that the top is too big. i'm 5'2"  135lbs  34a
I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated  it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion  it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on  i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning  etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it  it will be for its aesthetic...
I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.
Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
I didn't have any problems with the fit  i love the puffin pattern  the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length  or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it  so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but  yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short  please.
Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a "i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw  so size up.
Love the colors  love the design  and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or 2 so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down  and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
I love this blazer. its perfect for work  and makes a great statement.
Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.
I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!
Great quality  i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
This is a nice  soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear. the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt. although the shirt seems more fitted on the model  i found it to run large. if you are going for the same look  you might want to size down. however  i like the shirt and am keeping it. it is a good thing too  because the navy color went fast. very nice shirt and a pretty good price too.
I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work  but the previous reviews were exactly correct  the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit. the bottom has lots of fabric  which wouldn't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit  then the bottom becomes overwhelming. i am 5'5" and 115 so i have a slim build and couldn't get the bodice to zip in a small. the medium would have needed altering  which wouldn't have fixed the extra fabric on th
I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the "fleece" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last
I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
I had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip - to look stylish and beat the heat. it is huge. the tunic swallowed my whole. it came down nearly to my knees (i'm 5' 6) and it was gigantic - shapeless and did not look stylish at all. on the model it looks like it hits mid-thigh. i am a size 10 - and the l was like a giant trash bag on me. if i had time  i would try the medium ...
Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted  like me  order the small.
Love these - the colors are perfect for fall. originally ordered a small which fit fine (i'm a 6-8) but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasn't as stretched - i'm glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason.
This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction.
This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store  and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.
While i had high hopes for this dress to be my "go to"  unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame  however  the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra.
When i saw this shirt  i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers  and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin  so i hope it stays in good shape. until then  i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.
I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.
Quality of this dress is excellent! i ordered it in blue and the color looks exactly as it does online and the fit is exactly as it looks on the model. i am 5'4"   120 lbs  with an athletic build and ordered a small.
I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles  but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle  but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t
I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
For reference i am 5'5" and 118 lbs. the small fits nicely. the style is flattering. i have a big rib age  so as with many back zip styles that area is a bit tight when i sit down. not too bad though. ican wear it to work and out for a date both. colors are a bit subdued but i will enhance the pink or blue floral tones with a sweater  jacket and jewelry.
I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however  my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however  it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however  a supervisor was able to l
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt. i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look "puffy!"
At 5'5" (almost)  122lbs.  i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no  i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad  i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated  and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . .
After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off  and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities  for me  ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4" and 125  hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.
This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look.
I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen  appliquã©  pockets  raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium  for reference i am 5'4"  135 and usually wear a six or a small.
I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely "sack-like" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return.
I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice  just too much fabric for me. returning!
This ribbed henley is incredibly soft. you'll love the way it feels  but it does run a little small so i'd recommend getting one size up if you don't want it to be too form fitting.
I normally don't write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exception.    i am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks. with a limited amount of time to plan  i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway  to arrive just before the actual ceremony. out of curiosity  i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall wedding-ish. they did! so i too
I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy  casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.
I received so many compliments on these pants! these are not only classic  they fit amazing...look great with heels and/or booties. match both black and brown.
Lovely dress  fits great  very flattering  flirty  loved it so much ordered another one in a different color  can't wait for warm weather so i can wear these dresses
I always wear a small in retailer tops and this was very tight in the chest. had to return for a medium. cute top otherwise!
I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on  but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.
I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
If i could wear this top every single day  i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf  skinny jeans & ankle boots  or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however  i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.
I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft  very good quality  fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!
This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control!
So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.
Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size. thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.
I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.
This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is
The sweater has a substantial weight to it. i ordered xs which is my usual size and i didn't find it ran big at all. the sleeve length and hem length were perfect. very cute with jeans.
Tried on the blue in xsp and xs  tried the grey in xxs. i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and a long torso.  .  the blue version runs very wide in the hips compareed to the grey  but is very fitted at the top  giving it a trapeze shape. not a good look on my pear shape. the sleeves on the petite size were a better fit  but it was shorter than on the model. the grey is more slender with very snug arms that do stretch out.  .  a pass for me  even though i love the mostly cotton fa
I thought this would look great with skirts  but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops  but for this one i bought a medium  and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but  as i mentioned  it doesn't go with any of my skirts  so it's not worth looking for a small.
I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
Cute sweater  i really like the grey color. unfortunately  it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping  but even with a t-shirt underneath  i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back.
I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top  once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif. i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large. it's a shame  the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty  go up a size or two. if you are usually a
Thought this looked so cute  especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large  the fabric felt super cheap  and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned.
Comfy. i bought the moss color i really like it. great causal pant for spring and summer
Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!
The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.
There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful  perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect   especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it  5 stats! i sized up so that it would be longer
Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly  cotton  and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.
I love this dress!!! it's comfortable  flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.
I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size
Material is thin  with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward  shows way too much  would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.
The deep v doesn't gape  and flatters the neckline  while the waist-high side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless. the material is so lovely and soft and comfy  but clings in the right places to really flatter  while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way.
For the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent. the style is cute  but nothing more. however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.  the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.  no need to say - it's going back asap.  you should not sel
I love the colors  my favorite. purchased a medium and fits perfectly. i've been wearing it all summer. material is thin but super soft. for reference i am 5'8" 145 lbs 32dd. i'm obsessed with this tank. considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have  that's how much i love this tank.
I love the perfect length of these! i am 5'6" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!!
This little number is really cute  i got it on sale  after i looked at it  went home  slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0 i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work  or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear.
I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version  but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale.     i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.
The quality of the fabric is good  but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.
I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully
A nice comfy sweatshirt. i do wish it was just a tad longer; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i'm only 5'3! (i purchased the regular size not the petite)also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside.
Purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox. this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch. the fabric is so soft  fit is true to size  i don't like tight fitting shirts  if you do i suggest ordering down a size. overall great detail  fit and just as pictured!
It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.
I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size  i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
I've gotten so many compliments on this super adorable vest! it's soft & comfortable and the fit is very flattering. i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because for $130 i'd expect there to be no loose threads all over the place  but it's easy to forget about those when you realize how dang cute it is!
This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.
This skirt is not only cute but really comfy. i really like the materials it's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way. i'm 5'2" so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist. love this skirt!
Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is  however  not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd  the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted  it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked  as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!
Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.
I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.
This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.
I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine  stylish  and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.
I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.
The details on this are beautiful. i love the gold thread and white beads. i thought the medium fit too large and got the small. it seems to fit really well. so you might want to size down one size. the only thing that seems a bit off it the length. it's pretty long.
The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter  but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft  but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.
This tunic is lovely and versatile. looks great over a pair of jeans or as a dress!
I love this top--the fabric  the color  they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low  so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.
I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed  it's just a really thin material.
I really love this jumpsuit! i purchased it for my honeymoon and my husband loved it! i am 5'1 and 95 pound and i purchased the petite xxs - it fits very well! it is a comfy  thin and lightweight material  not too fitted  but definitely hugs my butt and thighs  more than my stomach and chest. i absolutely love this jumpsuit - colors are more brilliant in person! the only reason i put 4 stars for the quality  is because the first piece i ordered had a defective snap. i re-ordered the jumpsuit aga
I really like this top  a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.
Looks great on the model  but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size  they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in  but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns  and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a
The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).
Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!
I definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petite-sized version for the length. i was not at one of the stores with the petites. i did feel like at 5'2" the regular size is just too long. i tried a size 4 on with leggings and that didn't look right. the size 4 seemed fine (34b chest  118 lbs). maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings. i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped. i really li
I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.
This is a cute top that is very soft and comes in nice colors. it's body hugging  but not clingy. i'm 5'5" 120 with square shoulders and a longer torso  and when i initially tried a small i thought it looked ok  but when i tried on the extra small it looked much better. the way the top is cut it fits a bit weird under the arms  as you can see in the photos  but it wasn't enough to keep me from picking up a few colors when it went on sale. i like wearing this under a jacket or cardigan with jeans
I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south  and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen  but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful  more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore  but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun  distinctive new shift dress. got it  tried it on  took it off  went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image  but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10" right in the middl
As a lazy one  i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big "thank you" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design  perfect fit and perfect material  soft  cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3" ordered size
Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly  it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything  yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's)  but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i
This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short  stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
The dress has a partially sewn-in slip  which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.    i ordered a medium  and if it hadn't been for the slip  the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd.
I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning.
This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else  but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress  this will be a hard dress to wear.  the color is really lovely though!
This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look  it just was terrible on me. i'm petite  5'0" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer  but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware  this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge
I saw this today and decided to try it on  it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e  and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable  no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees  i'm ready to wear this.
This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
This dress has a beautiful fit--5'4"  150 lbs  34ddd  and the medium regular fit great. the only issue is that the bottom part of the dress wrinkles terribly. when i bought it  the woman folded it nicely  and i stashed it in my car for the rest of my shopping trip. when i arrived home and pulled it out  the bottom of the dress was horribly wrinkled. plus it's dry clean only. going back. :(
If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look
I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
I very rarely pay full price for anything  let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful  and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is  the length of the torso is long enough  the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"  140lbs  34b and the small fit
The colors on this aren't as vibrant as i hoped. love the cutouts on the arms though. great 4 season dress!
It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.
Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank
This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material  it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me  but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.
I bought this sweater in the lovely lilac and black. the sweater is a typical cotton weave in the front with more of a t-shirt material on the back. the drape is lovely after a quick iron. swingy with a flirty neckline. my middle us still recovering from baby #2 and this does a nice job of covering the bump. interestingly  i think they went overboard on the fabric and pleats and i could easily have down sized  from a large (wear size 12) to a medium.
I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white  too  but i wish it came in another color other than white or black  because i would get that. goes great for nice dinners  dates  weddings  almost anything. it's not ball-gown fancy  but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out. only problem i have are with the clips in the front. i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted  you have to un clip them and then re-clip  but it's worth the effort
This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously  this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7" frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl
I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
I purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it  but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang
The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.
I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!
Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
This shirt is very flattering  which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.
This top is beautifully detailed   it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!
This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.  *highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.
I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it's cute  but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews.
There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut  and it's very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere  and it's appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!
I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!
I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
This dress is a bit scratchy  but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair  the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene.     the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders  small chest and and slim.
This is a lovely skirt that fits well  but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also  it felt very static-y.
Purchased in the red and love it! love that it goes with anything from work pants to jean shorts. the ruffle details add just a little extra  which makes it perfect. i just paired with gray chinos a couple days ago and it made a lovely outfit. fits tts. i wear an xs and purchased that.
So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that  yet i'm not sending it back:)
I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch  it's nice to have on hand  but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin  ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall  it's a comfortable piece  but it's more like a thin  long-sleeve t-shirt  rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.
Really nice thick fabric  yet lays really nice. scarf included  love the poncho style. will get me throught the end of pregnancy and will look great after as well!
I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!
This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.
Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d
I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also  the sleeves are a bit long  but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!
I have shirts and dresses from this brand  and they are great. i was happy to finally see a pair of pants! these are just as soft and well made as the other items. i would recommend you try them on. there is only a slight variation from one size to the next  so it will depend on what look you are going for. they are cropped at the calf  but can be "pulled up" for a more dressier look. i cannot say enough about the material. it is so soft and comfortable. they do wonders for your behind- i think
Lovely fabric  color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).    disappointed.
A lovely skirt and i'm so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that  i expected the medium to run small and that i'd have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it's not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small  which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you'd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i'm 5'6" which is tall enough fo
Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too  but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.
I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty  beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
I love this shirt because when i first saw it  i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip  wore the tie in the back  and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet  but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
I love it. perfect  body hugging  just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is  however  unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs  5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence  go up a size. i can't  however  imagine wearing this sleeveless a
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!
I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small. i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy  so i would say it runs true to size. it is very soft and the weave is airy--not going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style. the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to. the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands. the sweater  when pulled all the way down  covers my butt and half my thighs (and i'm 5'9" t
Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.  the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-small  and it fits beautifully. plus  the weight of the knit is just right for  chilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!
I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine  the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown  which it was  but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little
I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.
I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.
I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11" so the shortness of the top isn't a factor. the material drapes nicely and doesn't make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are
First  my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice  but stiff  so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting  but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me  not up to the usual ms standard.
This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t
I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time  and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe  as pictured  so if you're looking for true grey  this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!
This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me
I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.  did not look at good as the beige.
Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.
It's like a coat for your legs  and lined with some silky fabric. the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up.  i am a little sad that they don't have a petites  because i think this is proportioned for women 5'5" and over  and i am only 5"3". also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch. so tall women with somewhat flat abs - snap it up. it's a fabulous look for you.
Pants were super comfortable. a little too large. and the fabric was a little too heavy. i sent them back  and i'm regretting it now that they're completely unavailable.
I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side  across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser  i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.
Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe. the jacket fit tts. the length was cropped but just long enough (hit just below my belly button) to feel comfortable and not too short for my 5'9 height. the quality feels good.
This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops  but when i saw this i just had to order it  so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke  but that can be fixed.
Like it; but it's quite short and rather boxy. i'll keep it because it's pretty versatile.
This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
I did not even pause over this dress on line - a white lace dress now? well  my local retailer at lenox atlanta - which has a petites department - had this dress in the window with a jean jacket. being a lace geek  i went in to find it. i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy  dressed down. great window display idea!    this picture does not "do anything" for the dress except wash out the true color. the lining is ivory - that vintage sepia photo look ivory. the lace is lovely ivory too  and the
I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"  120 lbs and tried a size s.
Overall beautiful skirt  material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt
This is silly  but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that "said " i am going more casual  and i love the "flex" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper  but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?
Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.
I'm always on the lookout for those special clothing items that add pizzazz to my wardrobe. this is one. i had been looking for a bomber jacket and tried many but this one falls elegantly and is really beautiful. i can't wait to show it off!
I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit. i ended up buying the rust color online too! i'm 5'3" 125 and i went down a size to a 26. cause they will stretch a little. perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots.
Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.
This is a busy dress that makes me think "boho-glam holly hobby". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style.
Got this in the "dark blue" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash  and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes  go with your larger size.  this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight  so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say  a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b
I'm stunned by the bad reviews by others. i love this dress! it is an amazing  feminine  detailed  exceptional work of art  and lucky for me -- who usually takes 14s and 16s -- that it runs big. there is stretch to it  and it fits great! lucky  lucky me.
I saw this top online and ordered immediately!  i loved the color  lace  and unique details.  sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!  the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly  and is very rough against your skin.  the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way. .....  that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.  it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a
This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out
I bought the pink  which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body  which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye
Love this dress  i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.  great unique dress!
The heart version is very pretty  i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs  as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me  like 3/4 length  not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  and short.
I am 5' 4 1/2"  125 lbs.  and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also  i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color  but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online.
This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
I have been watching this dress online since it arrived  finally decided to order it online. it is as great in person as it looks on the website. the fabric  cut and finishing of the dress are high quality and my usual size 10 fits great. it falls about 3" above the knee on my 5'5" frame which is a little short for the office  but i could do it on a friday with a cardigan. the fit is comfortable and flattering for a gal with broad shoulders and small curves. when i tried it on friends raved. thi
Scratchy  wide cut = not flattering  i tried to make this work because i wanted a different  unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either..  it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!
Love this top the crossover design is so cute. i ordered by normal xs (5'5" 110 lbs) and was worried it wouldn't fit right in the chest (34 d) but it does and even though it's cut on the lower side it's made so there is no gap in the shirt when you bend over. has a little elastic in there to keep everything together. perfect length and nice thicker material got the navy and red stripe and with white jeans is so cute!
I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it  which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6" and thin  but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25" in length on my sweater rather than 30" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa
I wanted this top ever since i saw it online  it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine  you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt  i would get it before its gone!
This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color  it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white  needless to say it went back.
I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist  the lapel doesn't lay flat  but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist  you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.
For fuller busted folks  this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful.
This is a beautiful  well made skirt that flows over curves beautifully. my only complaint is that the picture shows the purple lining showing through the tulle and the waistband having a purplish hue. the skirt i received is completely black and the lining doesn't show through purple at all.
This blouse is very pretty  but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it  or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.
This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress  for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women  definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it  but it's probably not for everyone.
I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them.
Very pretty but also very roomy. i'm using it as a swimsuit cover up  so it's perfect!
I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy  but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer  and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly  this will be going back.
Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed  even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter.
Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also  it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so  if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)
I love ag jeans. i own several pair  and i think they wash well  and wear well. that being said  i'd never purchased a pair of the "stevie" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag  and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans  but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me  the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived  they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except  w
I love this dress! the design is simple  colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy  no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously  it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns  i will just buy them blindly.    a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe
I am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.
It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.
I definitely like unique things  but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable  but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.
Just note the pink is different than in the photos. much hotter/more saturated. apart from that surprise  overall i'd recommend. nice design.
I am 5'3" and 34c and bought the regular xs. it fits exactly as on the model. soft and light and comfortable  but very sheer. cami required (have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra). great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants. love!
O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.
1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6"  135 lbs   size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.  2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean  i felt great about myself. but...wowza.  3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange  they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else.
So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.
Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.
Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.
Super itchy! had to return.
This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it "special" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.
On the hanger  this looks like a great lbd. on me  not quite. the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle.  for reference  i tried a 0p  and i'm 5 1"  102#  and 34a.
Overall  a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust  to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy  so i'd stay away if you are petite  with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.
I like the dress on line: color flowers  cut  etc. but when i tried it on it was just meh... the color did wash me out a bit  the flowers are still beautiful  but the cut wasn't as flattering on my body as it was on the model. 0p fit ok  but i didn't keep it. you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps  so adjustable  i guess that is a plus.    115 lbs 30 dd  26.5 in waist
I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.
Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10  there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt  just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely.
This vest is awesome - the photo does not do it justice. you can dress it up or dress it down. great materials used. does run big  so select one size down!
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!
I tried this blouse on and loved the style  comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.     but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars  as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable  soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large  but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far  i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos  the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he
I wasn't all that impressed with this dress on the hanger  but i am so glad i tried it on. it is super comfortable  very flattering  and can be worn multiple ways. spot on!
Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.
After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter  like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down  the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here  is rava. the length measured at 39" not the st
I like wearing leggings with this sweater with its blanket like proportions. so soft and comfy! have only experienced minor shedding  nothing problematic.
What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on  it has a comfortable vibe  high quality  medium weight  dark black wool  and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar  slightly lower back hem  and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st
This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person  i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now  spring  and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10  so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!
I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute  feminine details.
This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.
The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the "fold over" portion was not necessary.
I fell in love with this dress online and ordered it despite some of the reviews that claimed it cut too high in the leg and couldn't be worn as a dress. i thought it was lovely enough to wear as a long shirt even if that was the case. however  when it arrived  the side hems were not cut too high for me and i have successfully worn it as a dress (receiving many compliments along the way). i'm 5'2 (and a quarter) inches  117lbs. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly. the fabric is soft a
As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price
I was looking for a coat to wear over dresses. this one is the perfect length and works over all lengths of dresses (and looks awesome with jeans too). my only concern is how it will hold up in the rain - it hasn't happened yet!
The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!
The details on this dress are lovely. the embroidery is wonderful. but the fit on this dress is just not for me. it is very baggy and shapeless. it doesn't have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless. really unflattering. sad but it's going back.
I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater  more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute  warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
I love the design of this sweater...shorter length  with shorter sleeves. goes great with jeans and has a very different look!
Gave 4 stars only because i haven't worn this yet and don't know how the fabric will wear. thick knit  looks well made. no pilling/pulls. great color  true to on scree photo. true to size. regular medium fit perfect  enough room in the armholes and width to put over a blouse. for reference- 34-36 c/d 142 lbs 5'1"  short waisted  curvy  usual size 8-10p. didn't need a petite in this. the regular length hit at the waist and fit exactly like on the model. looked cute paired with the mauve navy stri
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
I got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern. the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving. i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines. it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some "swing" tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half. it's comfortable and flattering  could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi
I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it  either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure  (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.
I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s  but that would be cutting it  especially since i'm 5ft 11in  133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.
I love this tunic! the fit is ttt and the quality is nice. i will get much use out of this piece!
I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however  it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
I am typically a small at retailer  but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty  and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals  and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress  though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si
These pants are great! they are comfortable  light and flowy. they are perfect for summer!
The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5"). i can go between a 4 and a 6  and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said  the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately.
I love this sweater tunic! the neckline adds interest and is so flattering. i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model. my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me :) it is soft and not itchy at all. i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots. i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to. this will definitely be a staple in
These are nice jeans for the price. they are tight at first but do stretch out so i am glad i went with my normal denim size and didn't size up. i wish they didn't have a button fly but it didn't bother me enough to return them.
This skirt ran short  small  and boxy. if you can get the right fit  the skirt is great quality and super cute  but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
Let's face it  this dress isn't perfect for all body types  but fits mine perfectly. i"m 5'5" 120(it) lbs. i love the cut and the unfinished bottom feels very causal when need be or a little more refined when needed. the zipper has a long denim piece attached to help with zipping up. the denim is soft and lays nicely. i suppose the fact that i got it on sale does make me love it that much more  but i keep putting it on. with a closet full of clothes and sun dresses in particular  i still keep pu
I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!
Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more "square" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't
I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.
Love this sweater!  lightweight  comfy and does run large.   i usually wear a size 12 or l/xl in sweaters cause i don&#39;t like them to fit tight.  i read reviews and ordered a medium and it&#39;s perfect!  can&#39;t go wrong!  i ordered the red  but am now thinking of ordering the grey one!
Ok  so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight)  am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso  short legs  and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise  this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu
This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.
This top is beautiful in design  but sadly  i will be returning. it is hand wash  and even after doing so  i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos  size 0 in most pants   25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.
I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding
The model makes this dress look amazing  but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful  i loved that  but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full  not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but  sadly  it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you  but few others.
I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.
There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants  as i have several pairs of the pilcro "hyphen" pant; however  this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front)  and though they are slightly different  the fit and cut are the same. these pants are a great weight--can wear year round  really--but these will be my "go to" pants this fall and winter. the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots  too--"utility" chinos? yes!  the fit is nicely
Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha
Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small  but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite  but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows  yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say  i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts  the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared
I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady  with a bit extra around the middle  this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!
I love the pattern and style of the dress  but unfortunately  it's doesn't fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn't work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms).
I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9  155lbs.  sadly  i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.
Wow  this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?
Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.
Since there were so many colors to choose from and the 20% full priced items sale was going on  i went in person to retailer to check these great dresses out. glad i did! online i was torn between several prints  but in the dressing room  there was a clear winner for me (just for personal preference. the prints are still all great!). these dresses are so flattering and comfortable. great with a cardigan or jacket for work or sandals for the weekend. definitely tts. i am pretty much always a m in e
I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with  friends!
I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.
I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website)  but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand)  and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase  absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.
I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust  so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find  as i did  that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size  and were lots younger  it could have worked for a dress with tigh
I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.
I'm 5'3" with high waist and some booty. this dress has a fantastic  flattering fit. i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model. (love the belt too  btw).  the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath. i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals. looking for a suede jacket now...
I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy  so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference  i'm 5'7"  130lbs  34a). i returned it for a size 2  which fit much better. in the end  i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape  and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made  but it just wasn't for me.
How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size  yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount  the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough  the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref  i'm 5' 5"  32a  115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr
This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.
Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low  but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.
I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis
I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but  i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms  and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms  but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.
I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.    i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size  but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long  yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is  it makes me look like i have short legs.    also  the collar won't stay down  the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi
I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put "true to size" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight  as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi
Like previous reviewers have said  these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference  i'm 5'7"  130 lbs  34-27-37  and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants  but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6  i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares  so if you're thinking of ge
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
I'm 5'6"  34b/32c  apprx 125#  & lift weights so i have bigger/muscular lats  back  arms. my lower half i wear sz 25 mother  ag  or 7 mankind jeans  but upper is more med (4-6 sz). hips apprx 35"  waist 28". my tops: i don't like things tight. i ordered medium  top fits perfect  but waist/hips i have take in as more like a rigid/stiff  gunny sax cottony type fabric  not super light chiffon as photos appear. the under lining super short in front and top of calf in back  but lining follows the she
Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates "green multi"--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders  which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb)  i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.
I don't usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price  i really love the style. i like that it's made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up. looks cute both ways. i ordered the xs which is usually my size. it fits perfectly. i imagine the s would have fit also. it hits just at the hips. i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer  but it's not a deal breaker. my one splurge this summer.for reference 123 lbs  5'5'  32 d.
Love this sweater. i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath. it lays nicely.
I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried
I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture  and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous  and the top feels high quality. that said  as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust  and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle   which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted  so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always
This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.
Pic doesn't do it justice  very flattering. i got it in navy. definitely worth the sale price!
I ordered this top in xl in the navy print. it fits true to size. it's made of two very soft materials. the printed part looks like sailboats to me. it doesn't wrinkle or have a static problem. the solid knit portion is a good quality too. i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat. it's flattering. i like how the details make this a dressy version of a t-shirt while being very comfortable too.
This is a beautiful top  the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape  so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall  it's a stand-out!
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.
The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(
This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas  the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly  i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality  unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.
I loved this top  but had to return because the stiff applique made me look like a linebacker! i wish it could have worked out  because this is a cool top. if this particular design works for you  go for it!
I love sanctuary clothing. this parka is on the lighter side  good for this mild east coast winter. it is water repellent. the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long ( good for longer limbs). i received many compliments.
This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale  so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size  what can i say its a simple top  well made and so soft.
And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would "hang" appropriately and "swing" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.
Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also  for some who is on the flat chested side  you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above  i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions.
I bought the black motif  the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful  but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos  but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!
Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute  flattering  so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced
I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right  not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits
This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.
This is adorable!  lots of compliments on color.  great fit!
Unfortunately  does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top  dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!
I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however  it doesn't even cover my butt  that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"  i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.
I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy  so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all  its a fun dress!
Beautiful top  the silk was good quality  not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly  wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.
I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!
Love these jeans! flattering and comfortable!! great length for short girl!! worth the money!
I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.
These are a great casual pants with a lot of style. my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs. i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit  there is at least an inch difference please see photos. i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s.    who is making these pants? can't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa
Love this dress. the description says "pull over styling" but it's not. there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit. i bought a 4 which fit great. i'm 5'4" 125 lbs and it hits right above the knee.
The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.
I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size 12 figure. i was wrong. the pockets are flattering to a round tummy. the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they don't stick out. a good skirt for fall.
The concept of this sweater is really pretty. my usual size xl fit perfectly; not tight or too loose. the color of the sweater is not like the photo; there is a lot more of a brown tone. by putting the sweater on and taking it off i must have torn a hole because there is a 1 1/2 inch tear in the front where the peplum bottom panel has been felted to the body of the sweater. it literally pulled apart where the two fabrics meet. the other issue i have with the sweater is the area where the front a
I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending  but it was kind of a serious no go. first off  i ordered a petite size  but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5'  so not even technically petite  but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length  and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green
Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me)  but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.
When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough  but it has a weird under wire  it makes my chest look strange  like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.
I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.
I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly  it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest  then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b  this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.
The dress at first glance is pretty  feminine  and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me  all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap  hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting  already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on "everything" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return
Love these jeans. comfortable fit  doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up  lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes
I'm usually a 12  or size l in retailer and when i tried this on  buttoning it up from the bottom  i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined  which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy  and a good length - many trenches are too short  or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i
I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.
The fit is true to size. the quality is nice. i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet!
Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect. it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress. the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back  the softness  and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me. i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short  but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi
I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole  which is fine  but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist  booties and maybe a hat.
This dress is amazing! it fits true to size  very flattering and the fabric is beautiful!  i am 5'4" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch  but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee.  just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!
I'm not much of a chino girl  but these fit like a favorite pair of jeans and with heels still look really polished. love them!
Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason  after 5mo or less of normal wear  these have bit the dust.   i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes  just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others?     super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.
I ordered this lovely blouse the moment i saw it  and i am very pleased that it is the quality and fit i'd hoped for. i bought the medium in pink. i am 130#  34f  size 8 or medium on most tops. the medium fits me perfectly; i love the gathering at top back so that there is no pulling at all across the back or bust. i am mystified that all blouses aren't designed with a nice level of gathering to accommodate a bust and to give a flattering flow.. i am busty so awkward tightness can be a problem o
I didn't realize when i ordered  that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look  especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist  rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7" and i do like fuller skirts  but was
This dress is very flattering  comfortable and made me feel pretty!
I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering
Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!
This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.
What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.
I tried the size small on at my regular store  and thought the subtle  sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful  though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders  neckline and armholes  and the lower hem.  i ordered the small petite online  hoping that it would fit perfectly  but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.  i bought the dress
I got the pilcro hyphen chinos in a size 25p and they fit  so i assumed i would be the same size in the pilcro stet chinos...nope. the 25p was way short and way tight. i'm 5'3" and about 113 lbs. my mom is 5' and 98 lbs and they fit her so i gave the 25p stet chinos to her to keep. disappointed!
I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.  the "shawl" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed. i already returned this.
I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.
I debated for awhile about getting this dress. being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me  so i ended up ordering it in a large (i'm 5'10" a size 10/12.) it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like. i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well  but i think the large will work just fine. the length is good (hits right above my knee)  the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect. as o
Love the pleating on this top. looks great with my  white jeans. it's lightweight and has a slight sheerness.
This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.
This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
The sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you're a genius.
Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric  it's very scratchy.
Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!
Definitely a great silhouette. overall  it's just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said  it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-12 on the bottom (5'7" --- 35" 28" 41"!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress  but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely  my shoulders are petite  so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m
If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway.
120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me  i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.
This top has a beautiful pattern  and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin  but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.
Okay  this is the cutest sleep jumper i've ever owned. it's soft and cozy  and even a tiny bit sexy. i give it 4 stars because it's a little on the thin side; not sheer but close. really fun little piece. definitely recommend.
It's true to size but as an fyi for fellow pilcro high rise wearers  don't size down like you might with them. i had my regular and my high rise pilcro sizes and my regular size fit in these. the down side for these is they are clingy and a bit prone to a camel toe effect until they stretch out during the day
Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.
This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color  casual. fit me like all the retailer size  8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.
The style of this dress is quite lovely  i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store  however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure  i should mention that i am 5'9" and have an athletic figure but with hips.   the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the
I don't typically write bad reviews  but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me  and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small
I tried this on in store but didn't purchase it due to price  then kicked myself afterwards when my size was sold out online. i really wanted the gray. i finally was able to order my size when it was restocked very briefly and am so happy i did. this is such a cute poncho.  i also have the angel of the north poncho from last winter  and don't like that one nearly as much. that one was too long; this one is the perfect length. it curves down in the front and back  and then comes up at the sides r
This top is absolutely adorable  i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring  this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this  get it! you won't regret it.
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!
I bought this for a beach getaway with the purpose of using it as a beach cover up. it was great for this purpose! however  i also bought it thinking that i could use it as a dress during the summer. i probably won't be using it for purposes other than the beach as it is extremely light weight and a bit sheer. also  although it's hard to see it in the photo  there are slits on the side of the dress. all of these elements make it perfect for the beach when you want a breezy  light-weight dress bu
This anorak is perfection! perfect weight  color  and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5"3  130lbs  32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!
I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth  not too bright. if you typically wear "cool" colors and avoid browns  you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4" and 125 lbs  so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai
I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning!
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
After missing out on last year's similar dress  i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding  but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!
This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe
I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.    this dress runs huge. i usually wear a 6 or 8 in retailer dresses and went with a size 2 for this one. it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent. the materi
Love this dress. perfect for spring and fall. great material and well made. lovey design. the dress has a built in slip.
I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but
This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.
This dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet- it's so easy to pull on  but adding a nice pair of shoes  a piece of jewelry  and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time. i must admit  my local store didn't stock this dress so i wasn't quite expecting the texture of the fabric (i was expecting it to be smooth but it's almost ribbed?). it's soft and comfortable though  so that's certainly not a deal breaker. i only wish they'd had it in petite as i feel t
Right on trend  easy to wear  but a bit snug in waist. which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier.
I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line  wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me  this jumpsuit was just
Great  lightweight pants for summer!!! size down the length is slightly long and they stretch out throughout the day. i'm 5'8" normally a 33 in pilcro and took a large in these. so cute
I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!
I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however  the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft  not my 5'6" self.
I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made  super soft  and works well with jeans  capris  skirts  and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though  this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a
I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web  i immediately ordered it. on the website  it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater  i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders  which supposed to look modern...well  the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about  i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first  though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape  5'8  size 6/8  34 d chest  and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me  and i r
I wanted to love this turtleneck. i read the reviews before ordering. i love the color  the weight of the knit  the ribbing. the small fit me perfectly; i am a 34b  not broad shouldered  and on the thin side in my upper body. however  this item has a strange "blousy" fit. the picture of the back view hints at this but it's worse in person. it's like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey  which simply doesn't work with my shape. plus  i'm long waisted. i could have made this work had it not
The top is cute  but when i received it  it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side  the return was no problem.
I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.
I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.
I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more "denim" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.
Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area  some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh  what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty  so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.
These pants are a great buy now that it's on sale. even though the weather is warming up  it can be stashed away until next cold season because it is timeless. the fabric is thick but not bulky  the side zip is flattering  and the buttons add a touch of flair  which make the pants look very tailored. size 6 regular fit me well on the waist and hips (i'm 5'2"  26 waist  36 hips). i cut off 4 inches of the hem so i can wear it with 3-heels. i prefer the regular size for elevenses pants because the
This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me  but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size  with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls  but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.
I love this fabric  and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3  and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much  but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out  for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.
Pretty top  i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.
I bought this dress with a specific occasion in mind. i could not turn it down because it fit like a glove. i love the cut and the length.
This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.
I ordered this sweater in green  and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length  nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however  it was just so  so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8" and 118 lbs  fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored  since i've had a hard time find
Although i love the soft feel of the sweater  the zig zag design was very unflattering. also  the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.
I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.
I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so  decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to "cover up" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently  but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!
I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.
Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured  which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips  so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure  but wasn't amazing for me.
I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back  but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!
I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very  very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!
I really  really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty  and the front was flattering  but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly  i sent it back.
Cute but too thick and rough
Pretty color  great details  awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck  arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.
I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.
Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.
It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.
Ordered this in white  thought would be really cute. but didn't like  and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped.
Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10"  so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more.
I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.
I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews  but fear not  friends--this is a comfortable  flattering  warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it  which means pulling it on is a breeze  and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly  which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6" and would describe myself as pear-shaped  typica
I got this online in a sale and couldn't wait to try it on at home! it's so cute  the fabric is a great print and the fit is swingy  which i love. i have a larger bust than waist and i'm 5'8"  160 lbs. i ordered my normal size 10 and it fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear it with booties this fall!
Nice lines  just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.
The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier  more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
This dress is a beautiful  classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!
These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.
It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small
This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!
I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.
If you are on the shorter side  do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first  petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size  the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice  but i did end up with the orange one  more "dressy"  red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt  i had on trousers  and hte orange looked nice with them).
Not that i don't recommend  only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird  no kidding  kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit  so perhaps they run small?    i would get petite if you are usually a petite  the regular size bunched on the bottom  too long.    i am usually a 0p or 00p  or
I used my birthday month discount to treat myself to this gorgeous chemise and matching robe in the mauve. the color is prettier in person than on my computer. i bought it in size m  and size m clothes are normally a little big on me. this chemise fits  but there is no extra room or looseness. i am disappointed in the quality of the pieces. i have several beautiful 100% silk undergarments that i bought for myself in the 80s and 90s  and i am comparing this chemise (& robe) to those. this silk us
I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!
I love this shirt! lightweight and versatile! perfect for all seasons
This skirt is adorable. i like it because its different and i like this length. the cactus look gray in the picture  but they are green.
I wanted to love this dress  but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue  but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling  but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust  and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my
Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
I love this dress so much i bought it in 2 colors  it's so soft and cozy  i want to live in it!
This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.
Colors are much brighter in person  fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey  so still considering whether to keep it.
I tried this on in the store because i have had my eye on it for a while and i want to be sure i get the correct size. as other reviewers have said  it does run large. i normally wear a s and the xs was big on me. i could go with the xxs  but of course it appears to be sold out now. the lighter colors look like they would be slightly sheer  but the navy blue and red are not. i thought the material was good quality. not sure if it would shrink. top is rather long on the back  but the picture does
I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size  it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.
Love!!!! i got the green and it goes with so much!
Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight  but it doesn't bother me  its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"  125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal.
I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist  in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity  even in a petite xs  so it's going back.
Color not as vibrant as in the picture. skirt is darted  which is not clearly seen in the picture. (assumed would be cut on the bias  which i'm more familiar with in slip dresses.) i didn't fill in the bust and the style is such that it isn't possible to compensate with helpful undergarments. while not for me  i'm still recommending it because it may fit others better. reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service  but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
This lift weight cardigan is true to size  perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice  especially the little pops of orange.
More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.
I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a "wow" look. i'm 5'1" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine.
I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said  the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress  although if you are a taller person  the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.
Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!
I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!
Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+
Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long  stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...
This dress is gorgeous in person  but its very  very  very fitted. i wear a size 8 in most retailer dresses. i ordered the 8 and its not an option  not even with control undergarments. i sent the 8 back and re-ordered in a size 10. i wouldn't be surprised if i need the size 12. i hope it works because this is a beautiful dress. the pattern is stunning. the red is a deep brick shade. the fabric is thick  but not too thick to prevent transitioning from season to season. as other reviewers said  i am
So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight  the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue)  the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately  i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g)  so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular  which hopefully will have a little more room  but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!
I bought the white in a m  one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s  given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me  at 5'6"  so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.
I love these shirts. ordered in 2 colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves. so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long!! the fabric is fabulous and a great weight. one of my favorites for sure.
I love this dress. based on reviews  i ordered the small  and the only problem i had was that  while the dress is quite large  the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted  which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own  and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool  but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!
Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.
This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7)  it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look  size down. very cute.
The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful  but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.
I really wanted to like this top  but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life  not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all.
Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it  and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great  drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape  but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.
Soft  cozy  and cute  but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only. for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money. i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs  but i was ok with it being looser.
I purchased the black in the store and wore the next day. so soft and lays nicely  pretty sleeve detail. quality and fit as expected. the arm holes are a tad larger than i prefer  but i typically wear a camisole under tops so it doesn't bother me. for reference  i'm 5'8  36c and purchased the medium.
The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.
This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show  but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear  this would be super cute.
This top is so lovely. the fabric is thick and soft  and the drape is phenomenal. i did size down based on reviews  i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect  nice and flowy and very flattering.
This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room  or i would not have seen it. i tried it on  and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big  and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago  when just about everything in the store was truly unique.
I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it.
Kicky looking pants  that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight  boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice  fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids  but i guess i lied.
I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.
I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large  i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too  it just looks so good on.
Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering  but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered but you may risk losing the flare  which is unfortunate considering the price.
I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is!  i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work  out with friends or for date night!  perfect summer tank!  comfortable and flattering!  a great addition to my wardrobe! it fit true to size for me!
This dress is stretchy and soft  a great length  and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body  but it certain flattered mine.
I bought this in wine in both the small and medium. both fit but am keeping the medium since it drapes better and looks like the photo with longer length in body and sleeves. light material is a great weight since heavy sweaters can be too hot in heated offices. style can be dressed up or down for office or weekend. have ordered the blue and grey. only concern is how well the fabric will launder.
I"m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.
I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de
I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
I ordered xs petite and was pretty excited when this arrived based on the reviews. however (and maybe it's just me) the top was really  really large on me  especially around the shoulders and upper arms  so the shape was not flattering. sorry to have to return this item.
I really wanted the dark grey  but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person  the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size  and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.
Very pretty top  comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!
This is a very comfortable  good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short  and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on  it's great.  it is not made in the usa  as stated. it is clearly marked "made in mexico" from "globally sourced" materials (i.e. not from the us).
Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.
These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.
This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.
Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.
Beautiful lace detail and very soft material. runs a little big.
Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.
I'm a 36ddd  and have a bust about 42" so when i tried this on in a size 12  i honestly didn't expect to be able to squeeze it on... and yet i had inches upon inches to spare in the bust. this really is built more like a tent than a dress. on the bright side though  if you belt it  and gather the extra material at the sides it'll define your waist and the skirt has lots of swing and flounce to it. i do love a line styles!!     i found i had to roll up the sleeves otherwise the dress looked too s
I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho
Oh my this is the best cardigan ever. quality is superb and so soft. i am between a 12 and 14 so i ordered the xl  this cardigan fits true to size. will order more if more colors become available.
I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes  it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress  with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others  the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn't real
Love this skirt!  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly.  this skirt is the fall equivalent!  flattering and true to size!  there is some stretch to it so it's very comfortable.  highly recommend!
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!
I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.
I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
Warm and cozy tights for my daughter  she loves them!
This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern  and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.
This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.
I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice  but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
I do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels. i think the bodice is very flattering.
This piece is just gorgeous. you will almost never catch me paying full price for a clothing item  but today i did! i've been admiring it online  and when i noticed it had sold out (the red version) online  i stopped by a store to see if they had it in stock. well  it looks even more gorgeous in person  and i snapped it up right away. i envision myself wearing this all summer long and beyond.
This shirt is amazing. i bought it in white and found i was wearing it with everything...so i went back to get the gold (which is yellow). the dit runs big so order a size down. love the riffle around the sleeve and the little dot trim. very cute!
This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!
I have this shirt in more than one color! i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique! i personally feel the material isn't scratchy at all! also  i love this designer they are one of my new favorites!
Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist  it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu
This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair  they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so  that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.
This dress is super flattering. i love everything about it!
When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4" 120lbs  about a size 4 in dresses  32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height  it's just a few inches above my ankle  so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length  and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal  there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra  and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric
The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.
Bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did. it's a nice two-in-one piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater. striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy (i don't like things too tight).
I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.
This top was really cute on someone else  but not on me... on me  ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too  just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season  it is a bit boxy  but looks nice with jeans  white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...
The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
Tried this on in the "onsie" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of
I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures  and it has a lovely quality in person  the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on  and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips  large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
Perfection.  fits like other pilcto jackets and vests.  tapers in slightly at waist for flattering fit   weight is light for summer but substantial and good quality.  silver buttons  not bronze or copper.  slight stretch  super comfy.  no regret!
This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top  but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill.
I love the style  but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26  and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant  i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2  and 110 lbs. unfortunately  i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
Looks wonderful with a pair of dark skinny jeans and cowgirl boots.
This is a super cute top. the online image does not do it justice. the scalloped edges around the arms give it a flirty and feminine look. i got lots of compliments when i paired it with the shorebird pencil skirt. the material is thick enough to not make it see-through and it's pretty tts.
Got this dress in the mail today  and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality  and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather  and with a cardigan and booties  it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors  patterns  and lace are all just beautiful. for reference  i always order xs for loose fitting dresses  and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.
Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect  very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels  flats  or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.
This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris  and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash  lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny  winter day. i like the longer length  to the ankle on me  pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere  boxy  cropped sweater. another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater. the fabric weight is good for winter  they do feel a little itchy at first but it's not noticeable after wearing them a short while.
Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned
I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted "just another cover-up". in the final analysis  even at $35 (30% off 49.99)  it just hung there. if that's what you're after  then this is for you.
Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10" and ordered a medium. also  it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.
Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type  so might work for someone else  but sending back.
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.
I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it's very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.
I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
Awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed
I run 170lbs.  36 d  5'4" and ordered a regular 14. probably could get away with a 12. i didn't order a petite because i wanted the length. however i ordered the 14 because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage. it fits to perfection everywhere - but the waist. it's very loose. they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model. the picture doesn't clearly show the hi-low concept of the hem. i like that so it isn't a problem. very unique a
Comfortable tank  i'm short but it's a long tank  even in a taller frame.  i like that it covers my mid section.  beautiful blue color.
Thought this would be my goto fall "dressy sweathsirt." it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....
I noted that this runs large- i should say it runs wide. it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture  but i am really swimming in the l. that being said  i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front. i am 5'10 for reference  and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like  but it still works. the black and white print is beautiful- i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments. other reviews about the batwing sleeves
And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere  but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.
I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.
I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock  and when it did  i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges  depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution  so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package  but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom  and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing  but
Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..
I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was  however  pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side  noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much
Cute  but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that  returning.
This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!
I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them  but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me  it felt like tights material  almost. however  they were not see through  which is great. overall  they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9" size 6/8 curves  medium was a bit too loose.
I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt  the top fit a bit odd  not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i  too  found these ran a little small and went up a size.
This top is so pretty and easy to wear. the material is super soft  it's long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked. the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off! great purchase on retailer weekend  i'd be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale.
This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals  but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos  the dress is baggy and empire waisted  and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie  and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy  such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.    anyhow  i wanted to share photos of the real
I stopped into retailer the other day for some "window" shopping and as soon as i saw this cardigan  it was love and i had to try it on. the sleeves run long on me but i'm on the shorter side so it was to be expected. everything else about this cardigan is amazing. i ran errands yesterday and it was the perfect weight for our cooler autumn weather. love this cardigan.
I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size  medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight  casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.
Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick  just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a
This dress is a fun idea- but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat- it threw the lines of the dress off. i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo.
I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately.       fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different  there was hardly any beading  and the colors were washed out and dull.     i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
I am a big fan of ag  i'm sure i have 15-20 pairs. i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird: denim that is so stretchy it doesn't look like real denim  fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc.. so i'm always cautious  especially with their stretch twill. that aside  these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome. ag nailed it: great color  supportive  slimming fabric  great length and rise. a job well done ag!     howe
Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
Had to take a needle and pull threads to the back so not visible and i see this as an ongoing problem.
Yes  this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves  but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color  and after getting compliments  i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear  have an interesting detail at the neck  and could be layered. cozy  comfortable  stylish. love mine!
Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning
Runs really large. i am 5'4"  120lbs  32c  and had to exchange xs for xxs for width  but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.
I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.
Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3" and got a size small  a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style  fits great
This dress is great! it's easy to dress up or down and is comfy!
Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully  they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know  so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.
I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10  even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa
I am 5'2" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give)  but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so  it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter.
There is no possible bra to wear with this top. after one washing the neck felt funky. the pink color is very light. it's long enough for leggings. my shirt is a high hemline on one side than the other. i'll wear it but wish the neck wasn't so funky.
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.
I never write reviews  but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it's not a have to have top just to look at it  but once i put it on i had to have it. it's extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together.     i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a
I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12  but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self  and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night  you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops  or high-heeled booties with a n
These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through  even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.
I'm 5'5  145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red  medium and love it. yes  it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions  didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is  love
The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable  i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.
I absolutely love this skirt! i purchased both a medium and a large. i found that it ran big. i typically wear a size 10-12. i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect!
I was very pleased with this purchase. lovely print  good fit  and silky fabric.
I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes  it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says "dry clean only"  you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be.
I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi
When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store  i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry  or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.    sadly  they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants  but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.
I really like this jumpsuit  it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped. love the material and washed up nicely. should be really comfortable.
This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes  00p and 0p  depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes  i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far  so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area  i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re. the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor
This jacket is absolutely beautiful. the color is a much deeper navy than it appears in the pictures  and the brocade with the contrasting lining is lovely. however  as another reviewer commented  the back across the shoulders is incredibly small. i ordered up from my normal 2 to a 4  and it was still too tight. there is no way i could even lift my arms over my head without ripping out the back of the jacket. i fear a 6 will be too big. this one is going back  sadly.
I like the unique design and it's warm and cozy. i wear a medium 95% of the time  but had to exchange this for a small  but the sleeves are still long enough. it sheds a bit  but i'm guessing it will slow over time.
This is casual and comfortable.  along with soft touch of its textile  i also like the pastel color of flower prints.   especially  i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).  it also fits well with my body and makes look cool.     it is perfect for everyday use.
It's a little roomy  but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one  whether worn with jeans  work pants  or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said  the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me  i love that  as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny  tiny petite  but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.
Great leggings! they're well made and comfortable to wear. my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and don't fit perfectly.
This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short  but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
Love this dress. it's a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large  it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it.
I didn't want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona  so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale  i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown  copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook
I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog  but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up  the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also  the actual neck part was tight. for reference  i am 5'3"  108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.
This is a beautiful shirt  however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds  but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame  because it really is lovely. i sent it back.
I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.
I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli
I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of "hangs". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!
In accordance with other reviewers  the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold  silver  and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper  especially on sale!
Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms  the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling  but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look.
Gorgeous top but runs large  especially in the arm holes.
This is a beautiful top  however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!
This sweater has potential  but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick  and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high  so i need a longer look. the color is true to size  but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
I'm tall (5'11" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said  the material is soft and stretchy  but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it.
So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!
I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't
This vest doesn't have a button  so i thought i could put my own. but when it arrived  it just didn't fit that well. the opening in the front is too big  the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere. i don't know  why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening  how is one supposed to keep warm at all?
This fits so perfect! it is light fabric  not clingy. very flattering! i am 5'4 120lbs with athletic build.
This cute dress highlights some trouble spots and emphasizes good parts too  so i'm happy but not ecstatic.  for myself  the sleeves are tight and  so is the fit across the back and shoulders.  sizing up makes the voluminous skirt overwhelming.  the skirt is already a lot to handle in my regular size.  the good part is the pattern  swingy silhouette and it covers my tummy.  i have thick arms  wide bust  round back and meaty shoulders.  140# 5'3" 36d and purchased size 10.
I'm 5'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress  but didn't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely.     i ordered a size 2
This is a fun  cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s  i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size  it's is a tad tight around my upper arms  not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms  so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose  it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part  just fyi.
I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me
In the picture it looked to be a structured blazer  but when i tired it on (i got an extra small) and it was too big.
Love this top. it's very comfortable   and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.
I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.
I bought this tee in gray and i liked it so much  i got the pink as well. it is not see through or sheer in either of the colors that i purchased. for reference  i am 5'2" and the shirt hit at low hip. i ordered one size up for a"swing" look. very fresh  fun take on the basic tee. love it!
I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.
I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r
Being 5 ft  long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy  but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size 2 or 4 and i tried on both sizes in store. the 4 i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the 2 (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the 4 and i love the dress!
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer  but it was much  much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer  i jumped on it. she loves it.
There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
If your looking for something to spice up your wardrobe  this is it. rich in color and a luxurious soft hand but so much better in person. i plan to dress up with a long knit tunic and tights plus over the knee boots or with destructed dark denim and booties. i got the burgundy color and may go back for the blue as well. this is a staple for many seasons to come.
The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.
This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9".
This is well made and beautiful  but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.
I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs  i'm 5'4 130lbs  34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.
This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2  this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi ' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1")  and the fabric  while structured  was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass.
Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.
I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down. i was nervous it might be too flowy  but it lays very nice and is so pretty on!
I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however  the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy  but still a gorgeous top!
I just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on. once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac  i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints. the dress fit me tts (sz 6  34d-27-35) and looks absolutely adorable on! it's super soft  light weight but not so much that you don't feel it's worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love. it has a wonderful vinta
The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.
The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn't look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it.
I wanted to love this top  but had 2 major problems with it. first  it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt  which was terribly unflattering. second  the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.
I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac  and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length  small was right for 140lb  5'8"  typical size 6.
I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.
The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images  which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected  and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone.     it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips  you should expect
I bought these on a whim  patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well  look great and i had lots of compliments.
After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.
I wanted to love these pants  but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.
The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern  i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange  short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
Although this is an online only  i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store. this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo. it doesn't show as much in the model photos  but this top has a subtle high-low effect  which adds a bit of elegance to the top.    i took my usual size xs in the tyhlo brand. however  note that i am small busted (~34b/c) and this was already starting to pull some across the chest. my biggest critique it that this pulling caused a small ga
Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a "wow!" dress  but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for  itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying " look how cool this is!") .
I had my eye on this for a while  and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then  however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite  decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich  and the design is subtle  adn will nto fall apart  so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j
Big bust  smallish waist... this top is so cute and flattering! absolutely love it
This dress is great! it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall. it is very comfortable. the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt. overall  i love it.
I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors  material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.
I purchased this dress in 4 colors...beautiful and so comfortable. highly recommend
This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me  as i have a long torso  but i wish it had fit right!
The lighter tinted denim is a faded blue-grey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe  and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear. these feel like stretchy jeans to me  not leggings. i wear size 28 in most jeans and these fit tts. really nice.
This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but  i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely  but it was too short for me (5'7") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly  too  the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it  which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you  great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter
The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.
I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt  it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true  it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.
I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don't like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying  i liked the suit enough to keep it.
This is basically a poncho with arm holes. but it looks great and is well-made.   i got this in the wine  which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up after washing)  it is oversized and a little boxy. i'm a medium or large on top and i ended up purchasing an xs and it fits just fine in the shoulders and arms. the rest of it is still roomy (though short) but perfectly fine. i got this on sale  so it was well worth the price point.
Love the blue color. is a bit short  but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small  that's what i usually wear.
I got 2 of these dresses  one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 51 and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it's a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it's p
I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top  and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on  and once on  it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.
I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week  but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also  the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.
I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo  i knew i had to try it on. once i did  i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.
Yes  it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft  the colors are great  and the hood  well  the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.
I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it! it fits tts for me in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it's incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves  the color is a nice deep  rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way. the material is amaz
I read the previous reviews  but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items.  it looks very flattering on me  and great fit for my body type.  i would recommend.
After seeing the picture online  i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it  but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big  but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to
I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately  it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause  i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together  so the minute you put it on  one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
Like the previous reviewer  my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket  this shirt dress is very well made  very cute
I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.
Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.
I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4" in the length and 2" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on
I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.
I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous  but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic  but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8  to give you an idea. i would recommend it  but it is going back for me.
I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.
Cute  light summer dress. wish it worked for me. the tank part of the dress is light and super comfy. the bottom part of the dress is narrow and a bit fitted  doesn't work for a curvy bottomed girl.
Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also  the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately  it has to go back.
I was disappointed in the blue color of this skirt. i was looking for white. also felt it ran a little big.
These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them  which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7".
I so wanted to love this dress! the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer! i was so disappointed by the fit through. the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasn't executed that well. one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to "constrict"  the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average. on the bottom where it's flowy it doesn't make that much of a difference  but on top and in the middle it gives this weird "i
I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was "warm and cozy" and not itchy at all  but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair.
I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up  a size 6 instead of my usual 4  and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately  the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress  i'm not denying that  but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a
Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!
I also have this dress in 3/4 sleeve  tegan tunic. i love this dress. it can be dressed up or down.
I was in love with the green print  so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.
Fits true to size. good quality  style and length.
I tried on these pants and was instantly in love. they are very flattering and stylish  but also incredibly comfortable. i am 5' 6"  and the length is perfect to wear with 3" heels. i highly recommend these!
I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite.
I tried this in an xxsp. i am normally an ssxp or xsp. it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie. not the look i was going for. if i sized up  the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame.     also  i don?t feel the quality matched the price point. the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously. that being said  it is a beautiful color and on the right body  the style would work well. it just wasn?t for me.
This is a great skirt and i have received so many compliments wearing it. it's soft as butter and adorable with the ruffle on the bottom. i do find it runs small. i usually wear a 27 in jeans or a small in various tops and bottoms (and occasionally find i can fit in a 26 or xs) but i purchased a medium in this skirt. this is a very versatile piece. so far i have worn it to work (i'm 5'6" and it's not inappropriately short at all) with tights  heels  and a jacket  but i'm excited to style it for
This fit well  but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric  it would have been great.
I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
I got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those. they look like leather so much  that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to "die" so i could wear them ;). i am slim  but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely  they make everybody look slimmer  they are also super soft  very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge. the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes
I'm 5'9" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!
I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model  but if i was to tighten it  it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite)  and it looked huge  when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work  it was a lot of fabric  and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall  so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look  this is great. i would  however  order eptite for 5'1.5". (115 lbs  03 dd che
The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are  so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.
This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style  and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w
This dress is so well made  but it's a lot of dress. i think i would have liked it if it were shorter. it felt a little too 50s housewife to me  and i was hoping for a flowing material. it wasn't worth the price to me so i sent it back.
I love this tunic! it runs slightly large. i ordered my usual size small (i am 5'4'' 125lbs) and it is a looser fit but falls nicely. i wear it as a dress  and the blue/gray color is so pretty!
This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7"). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top.
This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with  it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.
I was a little surprised when i received this dress  as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined  and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through  for it is black  but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this  but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t
I am 135 and went with a size zero. it was very cute on but a little tight on my hips when sitting. the fabric is beautiful  and very soft and silky. the length was great  comes to just barely above my knees and is long in the back. great work outfit.
I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
This top is very easy to wear. it's a great  versatile  and unique piece. the textile is really soft and i found  quite special. it is pretty lightweight and the sleeves have some great stripes of more sheer fabric.
This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.
This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz  this is it. i have wide hips  and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality  and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!
Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog  i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!
I would have kept this dress if it weren't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that  it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice  substantial material.
I ordered these jeans in size 30  and it was a perfect fit. i love the extra stretch in these jeans. will definitely be wearing them all summer long.
This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy  perfect for a fall outfit.
This has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee. it's perfect with jeans  a leather skirt or even lounge pants. it's a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because it's so versatile.
Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it
Like another reviewer  i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display... super cute and ultra comfy... the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall. i purchased this in the olive color and just love it. very cute and flattering for a poncho-type sweater. i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit. i highly recommend this item!
White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.
This is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in blue-green. it's narrower at the top  more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected  so i'm a little concerned about stretching over time  but i'll be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does (or doesn't) come.
I echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.    i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering.
I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!
Maxi dresses are always my summer staple and moss has been my favorite wardrobe color lately  so this dress was a must buy! i'm petite and this came about two inches above my feet. i would be cautious if you're more chesty  i wear a c cup and typically am a 0/2 at retailer  but the extra small's bust line didn't hit under my bust properly and was too high up. i'm hoping sizing up will fix the problem if the small comes back in stock online. besides sizing issues on my part this dress was nice and
Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all  it's not a happy orange  it a darker rust.  second  it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice  the neck is cute  but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.
Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...
Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(
Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend
I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm  no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b  weigh 110 pounds  5'3" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!
Since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress  i thought i'd throw in my $0.02...first  to clarify  there is indeed a zipper. it's well-hidden under the l arm (i didn't think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine; once it was on  i could feel the zipper [not uncomfortably  i just realized there was one]). dress does not have a lot of give  so i imagine that zipped  it would be difficult to get off. because no give  don't order down; that said  i found this dress to
I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost  this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
I love byron lars dresses  and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is  sadly  going back today.
Love this poncho! it's casual  has a bit of a sexy vibe  comfy. great with leggings  probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey  lace is sheer so a cami is needed.
I purchased this sweater in red  it's a deep  rich color and although i usually opt for black  you can see the beautiful details on this sweater much better in the red. i love this item!
The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at
Love this coat. it fits very well - i'm 5'6" and typically wear an 8. it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention  but that's part of its tailored look. this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit. so happy with this purchase.
I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.
I love everything about this top. first  it's super flattering  especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested  and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too.
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
This dress is the perfect length and so comfortable! it's conservative enough to wear to work as a teacher but also so cute! i'm 5'6" and the large hits right above my ankle. medium fit as well but i wanted a little extra room in the torso.
The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"  103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well  but instead of looking slouchy and cool  it just looked too big. so  back it goes.
This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.
The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
What a fun dress to wear. it feels great  and looks great. i feel good when i wear it. if i was a kid i would wear it everyday  ha ha.
Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.
I am 5'5" normally about 120lb  but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes  even though they might not fit me currently! however  because this shirt is drapey  it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!
I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim  grey  or olive green dresses and shirts.
It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
This denim dress is best worn by someone over 5' 8". i had to spend a lot to have it taken up and it still doesn't look that great. so if you don't want to pay over $200 once altered  do not buy this dress.    the best part of the dress is the top. it was true to size on top.
I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
Reviewers may be right that this skirt runs large but it fit well on my waist. it does not come in petite so petite buyers should be aware that it will be more of a midi than a knee-length skirt. it is adorable. i love it especially for its whimsical design of birds  and the colors are deep and lovely with the red popping out more than it does in the picture.the fabric is heavy but there is a slight give to it  which helps with the waist. it's a keeper.
I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!
Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.
I am 5'6" and 140b  i'm usually a s and that is the size i bought. i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately. then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about 3" (just as another reviewer stated) and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter. however  i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged. the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size. it's back ordered  but once i get the new top
Disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?
Love these jeans! they fit great  they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.
This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding  even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!  note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit  enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out  doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr
I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.
I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders  armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh
I bought the orange in xxs petite  and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.    i like a swing style  but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer  and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.
So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!
Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it  was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!
I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say  i am tall (5'8") and lanky. the dress is oversized  but not overly so  drapes beautifully  and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work  for travel  on weekends  etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price  this really is a great  versatile find.
I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.
Purchased this maxi dress in blue print  size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model  but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.
This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms  or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms  this top may not be for you.
I ordered:  xsp  xxs  xxsp    xxsp was the better fit  some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said  ti was comfortable  the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders  and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color  the fabric  and the fit  but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small  try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.
I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
This is a gorgeous bathing suit. the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture  and much more beautiful. comfortable  chic  and unique
After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
I love this dress  the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled!   once i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!!
This review will be shorter as i already wrote another one and it was never posted..  ----------  1) these are high quality jeans; the fabric weight is light enough you will be able to wear them year-round  ---  2) i am 5'8"  144 lbs  and the size 29 felt best on me; for this brand i typically wear a 28-29. i felt like the 29 was cut too narrow in the hips for my body type. for ref. i am athletic  with shoulders broader than hips. if you're unfamiliar with this brand know they do not use a lot o
This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in
I originally bought this dress in the store. however  it ended being a size too big. so  i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived  i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may
This is a a great piece.   i tried it on in denim and went out and ordered the red checked print.  this was so cute!   i loved it in the red checked and then ordered the denim.   it can be dressed up or down.  it is comfortable and there is an edgy quality to the look.  you can wear heals and a statement necklace and it really is dressed up.  order a size down and it works well.  thank you retailer!!
I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is  unfortunately  more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well  but i bet it is lovely in navy.
Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4'  135  size 4-6  took a 6. something about the pocket placement  fabric weight  cut  and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.
I love these with tunics and little dresses! they hit at a funny place on my hips  though; i wish they were a bit higher-up. since the waistband is thick  they show through tops unless they are pulls up above my hips  and they're a bit too short-waisted for that. but i was able to stretch them a bit  and i love them!
Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish  118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i
I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away  otherwise i wasted $100.
This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans  sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over  and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3" 115# for reference.
I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes  2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.
The dress is beautiful  i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully  and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.
What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store  which makes sense because if it were hung it up  fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many "clothes" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made  so thin with cloth  that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes
These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch  and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.
I am 5'7 and 125lbs w a muscular bubble butt from climbing and biking. usually have trouble w shorts fitting right because my legs and waist don't match my butt. these shorts run large   i got a medium which should have been okay but they stretched out quite a bit after one wear so am returning for a small. it's crazy for my butt to be in a "small"anything. so- if you are a skinny minny  or have a flat butt  these may not work for you in that you don't have anything to hold these up besides the
This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress  but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night  but since i have enough date dresses  and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.
This dress is adorable. the colors are vibrant and very eye catching. i found it runs tts -- for reference i'm 5'4" 140lbs and i ordered a 6. the dress is fitted on top with some very nice/forgiving pleats around the stomach.
Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.
Bought this dress online and it came in missing a button. the dress is really pretty  and comes with a tan linen slip. i bought a size down because the dress runs a little large. also the sleeves are kind of puffy but overall the dress is elegant and pretty.
A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.
Love this dress so much  i bought the checkered  and then had to go back for the black! it is so worth the price. i wear it with sandals in the warm weather  and a blazer with boots in the cooler weather. it is beautiful and so flattering.
The dress looks better than the pictures online. it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order. i am about 126 lbs and 4p fits me perfectly. the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress. i am very please with this purchase.
Just got this skirt in the mail today and overall i'm happy with it and will keep it. i was disappointed that the color is not really plum in person as it looks in the pictures. it's more of an ambiguous color somewhere between brown/gray/plum. the fit is good  the quality is good  although the skirt is a little longer than i would like (and i ordered the petite size). it's not really a mini skirt  just an above the knee skirt on me. i'll take it to my tailor and have him take it up an inch and
I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!
The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming  and continues through details in the pockets.    i am 5'6"  34-26-38 and i wore a size 4 regular and 4 petite. the regulars were very long  and even heels couldn't help them. the pant leg covered my foot  covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels  so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite
The design of the pant hangs nicely and fit well 
I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well  the color is awesome  matches with other bright colors  mustard yellow  wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to
This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.
These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly  i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer  and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size  they are adorable!
Bought this in the white. i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps. i typically vacillate between a m and l  and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large  which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long. ---------- the fabric is soft  and the weight of this shirt is season-less; always a plus. it is not sheer by any means  but if you have a tattoo (like i do) you will be able to see it. --------- quality is
This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear  really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4"  i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft  flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!
I had a feeling this might not work for me  so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c  and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.  if you're petite/smaller framed  this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty  this doesn't do us gals any favors  in my opinion.  it is a lovely top  and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom  the inner lining was decent 
Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!
Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching.     i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.
These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.
I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed  and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water  the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad  luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned  these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty
This sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......
When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.
After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black
The fabric has a beautiful drape; the skirt is a nice length  and it blows  moves  and swings in a most flattering way. the gray is a an elegant color  and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events. the top  however  sags  and overwhelms the more fitted lining. too bad!
I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much  went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin  it's super soft and just the perfect length.
Right out of the bag  this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top  though). the fabric was heavy and felt "damp" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.  and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the "v" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose  droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither "flat chested" nor "busty"
The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft  sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think "oh my gosh  that's the one!" but if you try it on  you will have this moment. it is comfortable  flattering  and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.
I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton  and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur
It's a pretty top  but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design  just not sure i will keep it due to length
While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.   also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium @ retailer  but i have a sm
These culottes run very large--more than 2 inches of gaping waist band in my usual size. i would have kept them if they had fit  although sitting in them on a hot day might cause major wrinkling
I first saw this online  and as a long-time wearer of vests  this really caught my eye. once it came into the store i was able to try it on  in grey small  and it was perfection. it just wasn't in the budget so i decided to wait for it to go on sale and watch the website every day. we have 5 stores in my area and when it got down to only 2 having limited availability for a small i sprang into action. the largest store had put it on the "almost gone" rack and they had only 2 smalls. i tried them
Beautiful detail  soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length.
I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
I like the design and the size/style but the fabric is different than expected and not quite as comfortable as possible. but i still like it and will keep it.
Okay  so i have an upcoming day of travel with four kids  a husband on crutches  and a flight leaving at 6am for which i have to leave my house at 4am  followed immediately by a le cirque show upon our arrival. i've been looking for something to wear during this chaos and this is it. the fabric is dreamy-soft  and the drape  perfect. yes  it looks like a dress  but i am happy for the conservative pants/jumpsuit it actually is. the pockets hold my phone without sagging  and i can wear sneakers du
Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however  the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
Okay  so in terms of quality  i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store  but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs  5'7  115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t
I wanted to love this dress  as the length  cut  and color are exactly what i've been looking for. but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is.
This was a perfectly nice dress  but embroidery was less elegant than i had expected. be sure to look closely at the neckline  where the material is thick and somewhat informal. it's pretty  but doesn't work for me. otherwise  it is a well made  comfortable  easy-to-wear summer dress. (i sent it back  but thought about it for a while first.)
This coat is really nice and cushy and warm  but it runs very very large. i am about 5'7"  150 lbs and i ordered a medium and i probably should have ordered an xs because it was ginormous. i returned it in favor of another jacket. i'm sure i would have loved it if it were smaller but i found something i liked more in the interim. it's also a little bit darker in person. just a little bit  i was expected it to be more creme white and it was like a tan.
Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.
I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.
The retailer store had mostly white left of these pilcro linen pants so i tried them on. the main reason i did not leave the store with them is because i could see the washing tag inside the pants as clear as day. the white pants were just too see-through and i was really looking for some casual items to wear to the office. if it was at least lined  these pants would have come home with me. otherwise  i think the fit was tts.
This top is beautiful  however it runs beyond big!  i ordered my usual size and i could have fit 2 of me in this top.  i am reordering and going 2 sizes down!  the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.
This dress is gorgeous  but if you have a larger bust size  i would not recommend it. unfortunately  it was not available in any nearby stores and i had to order online. the low cut looks cute on the model but realistically with a chest it ends up looking a bit too revealing. i am bummed because the dress really is beautiful!!
I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.
For reference  i'm currently hovering in the 14 range for pants (called "curvy" on the lower half  hahaha)  but purchased these in a 12. they are so flattering and comfortable  i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size 10 for when i loose weight. they look perfectly tailored! the fabric is substantial (more of a spring weight than summer)  so you don't have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant  and it drapes e
This is a great summer top! love the way it drapes and the quality of the material. bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out. my only complaint is that it doesn't come in way more colors!
This has been my go to top for cooler days  so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10  36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size  but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.
These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect  quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.
I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note  the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  and took my usual size xs.
Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back  and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose  fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small  5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.
I love swing tops. the more swingy  the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online  but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material  and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online  and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms  so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped  but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w
Love this dress! great for dressing up and down or just to throw on for the weekend. the fit is very flattering but i will say the fabric is very thin so you must use a slip  it's totally see through.
Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.
If you know one.september and you know what's good for you  then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way  this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co
Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly!  yes it's itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!
As with most retailer tops  this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice  pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
This is a great dress!  very different and light but cute details
Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.
This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
I wanted this romper so bad  after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab
I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
The fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy  loose fit. reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit. great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt. easy piece. would size down. i'm getting lots of use out of it.
Saw this on line and decided to "splurge" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture  appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed.
I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece  and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops  the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo  for instance. it is definitely not slimming  but the striking patt
The shirt is very comfy and is slenderizing in the waist area.
This skirt sparkles when you wear it- beautiful in winter. it is made well  great design and fit  true to size. it is a beautiful fabric with deep blue flowers stitched in  as well as soft silvery gold thread sewn into the background. great length too. fabulous.
Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.
This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.
Hi   like the other reviewers  i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm  yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out  so buy now if you want it.
Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6"  130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame
I ordered this in a 4 (34b  140lbs.  5'8") because it looked like it would run big  and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy  so i returned it. that said  the material is gorgeous!  as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust  this dress would have been a
I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
I'm in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i'm so glad i purchased it  it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures  but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it  but glad i didn't. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high  and it probably wouldn't have shown. the wool material is very fine  not scratchy  and a bit stretchy
I got a small (5'9  135lbs) and it fits great! it is super comfortable and also looks really good on.
Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns  the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed.
This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the
The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.
I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.
First of all  this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly  it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless  it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however  i was able to go down a siz
The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
This is my new favorite top! it's so comfortable and looks great. i wish i could order it in more colors!
Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.
This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy  cropped shirts  but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size  but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect  but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!
This top is beautiful on  it has very feminine detail and is very flattering. the first time i wore it i got 4 compliments on it. i would definitely recommend!
Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any "wrinkles." i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come.
This t is a beautiful color  and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy  however - very thin cotton fabric  without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips so instead of covering them  it highlights them. i'm disappointed  and am returning it.
Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.
I'm disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo
Love the muted orange color and the design. it's lightweight and will be perfect for fall days!
I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture  but they aren't too tight.
I love the details of this top  from the pleating to the sleeves  the pommed edges and the black lace at the bottom. the material is soft and comfortable. the fit is flowy and the details are feminine yet simple. it's light weight which will be nice in warm weather. and let me say once more how much i love the sleeves.
These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely  is a gorgeous color  feels soft  and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand  but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!
This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful  but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but  the rest of the dress is loose  as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders  i'd be swimming in this dress. so  all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo
This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.
The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.
Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.
Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.
I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.
After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering  loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise "casual" floral pattern. i would highly recommend
The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short. perfect length as well! dress up or down. love these shorts and wish there were more colors!
Tried this on a whim in store  and it might not look like much on the hanger  but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape)  the fabric is light but good quality  and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win  even at full price. for reference  i'm 5'7" 128lbs and took my usual size s.
This top is really cute online  but that's about it.  it runs large  but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it's very pretty on. that being said  i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies  i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion  my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if
I tried on the grey motif yesterday  and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved  and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs  and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms  so i generally wear a small  but i tried on the small  and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath  so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath  go with your usual size.
I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however  i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
I'm a stay at home mom  always on the lookout for something casual  interesting  yet put together. it's preppy yet quirky with the embroidery. i love this shirt. great with jeans  can take you from shopping to playground and lunch without feeling under or overdressed anywhere. the sparkle from the embroidered birds gives it spunk to not make it look too boring and predictable. at the same time  it isn't something that screams  look at me! a perfect mix.
I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general  this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand  you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
This dress is indeed so lovely in person. i am so glad i ordered 2 sizes (0p and 2p) based on the straighter-looking cut. i am 115 lbs  5'1.5"  adn 30dd bra size. verdict  the 2p fit better. why  the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open (and did# i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress... not an option with such a unique piece.    other things: color: wow  very nice in person  i was afraid that the colr would wash me out  but no  i have very p
I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short  just perfect.
Beautiful dress...appropriate for sunday  and special occasions. grab a 'honey slip' to compensate for the sheerness  and you're set! one star off for static cling. otherwise  no regrets with this purchase.
This dress is really gorgeous  really fun and beautifully made. i'm typically an 8petite (140lbs  5'4"  34dd) so i got this in an 8 and it was huge on me. there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me. even if i sized down  it feels a little age inappropriate for me. i'm 21  and it felt very conservative and unflattering.  i think this dress is excellent  just not for me.
Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots  and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!
While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips  it does my hips no favors)  but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft  it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats  it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said  the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well  so maybe it's more
I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible  unflattering  and laughable! please try again with this one  retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!
Not a coat by any means  merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.
I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.
I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.
Totally see through.
I was not expecting to like this. i tried it on in the store on a whim. it happened to drape beautifully. this will be a great work dress for the summer with something underneath the bring up the neckline. the blue color is soft and pretty.
I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set  but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly  i returned the set.
This is a very pretty  feminine top with nice detailing.
This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely  design and quality are impeccable  and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!
This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body  while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise  it will be going back.
The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look "hippy". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso  so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.
The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo  my measurements are 38-30-40.
This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.
I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime  and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#  but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky  so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4"  between 135 and 140  and curvy #very busty specifically)  a
This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater. i found it to run large  so thankfully i ordered one size down  which was perfect. i'm normally xs  but the xxs was very flattering  still loose and casual  but fitted in the waist and arms. it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame. the regular was fine  but a petite would probably be great. the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail. the cowl is nice  not too overwhelming. this is so soft and
I have the white lemon lace shirt and love it so i was excited to see it in a color well suited for fall. the peacock pattern on the blouse i received is perfect and the pattern is well placed. i do love this one as much as the lemon blouse  however  the color is not the same as it appears online. it is more of a jade green color  and although it's pretty  i would have preferred it to look more of a blue color. i'm keeping it  as it is still an unusual and elegant blouse that's cute with dark sk
I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7
This is a modernized hippie sweater  so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude  pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth  but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look  not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips  and the hem falls right above my knees).
I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build
This has a lot of extra fabric in the chest area. i was hoping i could button and close that in a way that didn't just have it jutting out. luckily  it's still flattering. definitely bulky. and in the black  it's picking up lots of dust and lint. still a great cut and look  so i'm happy with it overall.
This dress is more beautiful in person than it is online. during the fall/winter i love to wear dresses with tights and pair them with boots. this dress is so cute  the material is pretty thin  but lined and flowey  i am 5'9 34 b bra 27 inch waist and a size 2 was great. the dress itself is pretty shapeless but string around the waist is adjustable to make it fit you the right way (giving it some shape) the v neckline is definitely more attractive in person than in the pictures  and the stitchin
Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders  and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference  i am 5'6"  123 lbs  and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a
This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
After reading the reviews  i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.   i'm 5'4"  126 pounds and generally wear a size small  but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much  and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.
Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house  but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit  but was shorter than i wanted.
I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue  and wanted it. however  for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it  and by the time i did  only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived  and as i was trying it on  i thought  this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something  but n
I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..
I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
I adore this shirt. like a previous reviewer  the shirt runs a little small in the bust. i got a 6 instead of my typical 4 and it looks great. the quality is great and the color is lovely. the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight.
I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
Love love love! it's the perfect cozy  comfy piece for a bitterly cold day. and the color is such a nice shade for the dreary winter.
This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good  solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.
Bought this for the beautiful fabric and easy fit which it has. fits nicely through the shoulder area and is a little on the baggy side in the legs but the draping fabric makes up for that. i bought it in petite small and it is definitely long enough for a dress.
I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also  didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
I love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it  but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.
Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer
First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly  it has a really funky  cheap  unfinished  raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again  does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.  i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it's
Very comfortable  material is good  cut out on sleeves flattering
I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn  quite obviously  inside out. only after i received the navy shirt  where it is extremely obvious  did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but  because i love the style and the fit  i kept it.
I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe  but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately  i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long  so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't
You know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be? well  this one is better then i had hoped! it fits beautifully. it is crafted beautifully. there is nothing i don't like about it. i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is. i thought it might be a heavier denim  but it is perfect. not so light that you can see through it  but cool and breezy even in the florida heat. do yourself a favor and grab this one before it's gone!
Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot
The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.
Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.
I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.
I took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did! i got the regular m and it fits perfectly. it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great. as a petite  the regular m fit perfectly - heals or no heals. its comfy and lovely!!!!!
This suit was high quality  and a cute design. however  it is clearly made for a lean body type.
I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!
Love  love  love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold  burgundy  black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.
This top is "comfort wear" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said  it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time  it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable
I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest  but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape  it'd be worth it  but it's going back.
I absolutely fell in love with the design of this dress! the colors and cut are easy to wear but unique enough to stand out. i was between the medium and the small and ultimately went with the medium. the dress hits right above my knee  fits nicely at my waist  and is well made. the top does seem a bit loose (as pictured on the model) but i prefer a slightly more fitted look. a padded bra would probably have filled out the extra fabric but it was an easy alteration and will allow me to wear the
I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i'm bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i'm 5'5" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips  the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it.
I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
This si=hirt actually has a shimmer to the fabric. it is more of sweatshirt material but i like the thickness  not too thick not too thin. the color is nice in person  and has a shimmer to it. i like the detail in the neck too with the sequins. reason i didn't get it is it felt a little big on me (smallest is xs) and also the color wasn't optimal (i am rather pale). otherwise  i do like the shirt.
This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.
The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.
This dress is lovely - the soft material is prettier in person and the fit is perfect for me. i found it tts  wearing my normal s. i'm 5'8.5" and it hits me a little lower towards my ankles than pictured  but doesn't the floor. it will be perfect for an upcoming wedding rehearsal lunch and a go to summer dress after that!
The dress is as great 'in person' as it shows in the pictures. if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look. if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get. i am 5.3  117 lbs and tried both  xs regular and xs petite. i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer length.  everything about this dress is perfect  the color  the material  the cut. highly recommended as a transition
This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!
Nice dress  but the leather seats of my car were ruined when the sharp metal beads on the back made deep scratches~ not fun at all. now i must carefully take them out  bad design feature.
I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20" as it states on the website  it's more like 18")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po
Not being into bright neon colors  i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.
I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee
Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.
I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still
This sweater does have a matching tie belt. it is detached  no belt loops. i'm guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material. i loved this sweater on line. i could not bring myself to order it at full price. with tax it would have cost over $200  seemed too pricey for a sweater. when it was marked down to $99 with free shipping i couldn't hit buy fast enough. i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out. my disappointment was the color. it is fa
I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.
I love this dress! great fit and quality. love that the skirt is lined. this is a real throw on and go piece. i've worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers. my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat. but overall an amazing dress!
This is as beautiful in person as online  but the length is shorter than the description  and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1"  i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however  the 28" length scared me off  so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25" long  but it's actually just about 24". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card  so i will keep :-)
I love this top. i'm not one to iron  so i wash (and hang dry) and wear it. great with skinny jeans.
The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
These pants are more like 9" not 10". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
This was the first suit i've ever ordered online and the first one piece i've tried since i was a very young girl  so i was a little skeptical going into this. i'm 5'9"  ~145 lbs  34b  with a pear shape and short torso. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fit--the length was right  the bottoms fit really well (i was nervous about the boy short/hip hugger design)  and the suit was just very comfortable and cute. however  something about the cups just didn't work with my chest; my breasts di
I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing  i love knits  and i have loved other maeve dresses. however  i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model  to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.  for reference  i am 5'5"  slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c  hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j
I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me  it's not a flattering cut.
I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade  slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size  however  to get the perfect fit.
This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.
This is such a classy  elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color  but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.
I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth it...  _______  pros:  - true a-line silhouette. if you have curves and hips like i do (5'9  36c  hourglass  165 lbs)  then this skirt will flatter you completely. there's a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because it's a thicker fabric.  - runs tts. i can normally wear
The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.
I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didn't want to pay full price- i got it on sale and am so happy i did! it is super soft and comfy. it also fits perfectly- not too baggy but also not form fitting. as a moz fan i couldn't pass it up. awesome sweatshirt!
I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark  not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl
This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy  well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale  it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.
I loved the lines in this jacket  but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
I was in love with this top as soon as i saw it. i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together. i've worn it once (the day i got it  i was so excited) and washed it and it is still in great shape.  i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in  as it was a little longer than i'm used to. but nothing too long. my torso is short.  the material is not thick or heavy. and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin. nice material  but not something to wear if it's very ch
I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.  the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin  as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area
This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however  if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique.
Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one  however.
Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple  comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.
I loved the material's texture and drape  but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees  but...)     other than the see-through nature  i loved this shirt!
I just tried it on and it fits well  with no extra room. it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe. the color leans more towards green. now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear it!  i think it will be cute with boots.
The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric
Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale  but not before that.
I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer  i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.
This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.
I bought these in the store yesterday and am thrilled with them.    sizing: they run large. i am glad i bought them in store because i was planning to buy the 28s and the 26s fit instead. for reference  i am 5'4"  athletic  postpartum  135 pounds.     fit: inseam is very long. waist is a flattering v-shape  versus straight across the midline. i find these a little lower rise than i'd ideally choose--they hit around 2 inches below my navel. the back pockets are small and high. i find the butt are
Nice jeans  just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise  fine.
I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color  and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size  but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back  i went with a medium  but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well  so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back  but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
This shirt was better than expected. the fit is fitted but still flows. it's comfortable and the material is great. it goes with anything  ive tucked it into pants and skirts but i've also just worn with leggings. looks great either way! im going to buy more of this shirt.
This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high  which was a surprise for a summer tank  but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top.
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.
I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect  a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo
This is probably the softest  most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer  love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.
This goes well for cool weather. great with jeans or other casual pants. i got the green  it's more of a teal color but pretty. runs large. i usually run between small and medium  i got the small and it's a tad too loose on me.
I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho  and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger  but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body  which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
Absolutely adore this dress. soft and comfortable fabric  ankle length but could be knotted in the front to be shorten. i am usually a s but had to buy an xs. the neckline may be a bit too low  if you are flat-chested. if you happen to see this gem in stores... it is a must buy! it will sell out completely in two days. some customer went back to exchange the next day that it had arrived in-stores but it was sold out  so we had to order it. perfect for all seasons and layering.
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.
I bought this in a medium regular for someone else. i usually take a petite xs and it seems to fit me! i'm surprised as the pullover version seems almost like it runs a bit big. that said  this is a beautiful cardi! it's soft  the colors of the flower are vibrant  it's flattering once you adjust for the size issue. it will go with a lot of things as you can dress it up for work  or dress it down a bit with jeans.
So i thought this sweater would be snowy white  but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive  i do like it  just because it is not snowy white like i thought  it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.
Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek  almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.
I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the "gold" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s
I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
These pants are really great! the fabric is soft  but substantial  and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the "grey" color - it's a very light grey  almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"  124 lb. and purchased the small.
Lovely jeans  love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans  the relaxed "boyfriend" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute.
I bought this t-shirt in three colors and i'm keeping them because they work for what i want (travel clothes) but the t-shirts run big and are too boxy. i think they look nice if you tuck them in.
As one would expect from boucle  this sweater is incredibly soft  warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful  goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling)  and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs  with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well  in my usual 4 petite  i think it would look nice on some people  as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.
I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant  but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
This dress is really cute in person. however  it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot  but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa
This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery  yet subtle  and it's a nice sturdy cotton  not flimsy and cheap looking. however  i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts  but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin  this might be great for you.
Loved the look  fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only  you have to be kidding?
Cute top  not great on me. beautiful  bright color.
So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.
This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!
This is a very nice  well made skirt but beware  it runs extremely large in size around the waist. i usually wear a m in most things  and i am going to return this skirt for an xs.
Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day
These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit  classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming  but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot)  or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day  roll them up for ca
I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull  mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn  stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.
Great jeans by pilcro  too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.
I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco
This dress is very feminine and flattering on  especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). when it's very fitted on top  i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2"). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman  but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is
I am a sucker for a good swing top. i own many styles from retailer and similar retailers. i carry my weight in my stomach butt and hips  so this style is always good for me. as soon as i saw this online i fell hard and waited patiently for it to arrive at my store. finally it did! i love this top. its very swingy. almost cut like a circle so there is tons of room in the body. the sleeve is more fitted  but my arms are larger so it might just be fitted for me. there is a bit of stretch to it. the
I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color  the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach  in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors  just watch getting water or anything else on it!
Yay  i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff  as well as summer festivals  nights out  travel  etc. i love the design  length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice  but in a very casual  appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages  it's flattering for us curvier ladies 
Tried this skirt on in the store and loved it...so pretty feminine and versatile except for the color.. although its a gorgeous color and i do love red how often do people wear red skirts? i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors. unlike the other reviewer i think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor. as this would be a totally frivolous buy i'm going to resist and try to wait for
I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.
Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny  bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also  they aren't navy. they're
First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7"
I loved the fit  color and style  but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.
This top is true to size for me  i'm 5'8'' 128lbs  and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big  i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms  the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect  i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel
Im normally a medium across the board for outerwear. (5'8" and 135 lbs) this jacket looked giant from the photos so i bought a small. when i first tried it on i thought no way  it's gotta go back. it was enormous and the fit was rather awkward. i looked like the size of a house from all angles. ha! i was still in love with the color and print. as i wore it around the house it began to loose it's rigidity and form against my body in places. it is definitely a jacket you got to play around with. d
I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8" and about 160 lbs.
This is m frist pair of flares  and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed  but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly  but combined with the flare  the high waist is
I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large  but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of "padding" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"  130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu
Gorgeous embroidery  soft fabric  great drape  hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.
Hard to find longer shorts that i like. these are really cute. i thought from the pictures that the backside would be faded and lighter which i wasn't thrilled about  but willing to order and give a try. great to discover this is not the case- nice regular color on back and no fading. really cute shorts.
Uhm no. oh dear  no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric  the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy  oh boy was i right. sadly  this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top  though.
I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope.
I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.
Stunning  beautiful  elegant  comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing  as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body  skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer  offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site.
Unlike the other reviewer  i found this skirt to run small...very small. i am pear-shaped and always wear a 12 or size 31. the size 12 in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist. another inch in the zipper would be nice! there is no spandex in this skirt - just cotton - so there isn't any give to the fabric either. i ordered the size 14  which fit like a glove  but i would really like to see if the 16 would be better. embarrassing but i am just worried that with 100%
I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!
I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey  which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!
Cute design. runs big in neckline  falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet  but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.
I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.
First of all  the label on this dress is maeve  not nue by shani. second  i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny  which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall  i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.
Trying the gray version on in the store  i found that the size of the armholes varied greatly within the same size. i am a 32c  5'6"  120 lbs. bought the size s. the top looks great with a faded denim skirt and is also appropriate for office environment. i also ordered the ivory in a s  but again  the armholes were so large that i had to return it. if you decide to try this top  order it in multiples of two sizes to find one that fits your arms.
I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
I bought this coat 5 years ago and every fall/winter  i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn  but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it
What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"  but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me  so i'll be returning it.
Like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a 32 or 33  possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a 36 c  i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.
Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!
This dress was very cute the first time i wore it  but after my second wear  the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward.
I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot)  and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it  it met all my criteria  and as an added bonus  my husband said  "wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said  this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy  flattering (in all the right pla
These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.
This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn't wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5'5" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too 'long and heavy' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn't work for my body type  making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are  made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a
These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!
This caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today (the green). i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit  but the xs fit me better (better fit in armholes and also less billowy). i really like the way it looks  but ulitimately did not purchase it today. i might reconsider on sale. the flaws (in my opinion) are that it is dry clean only  the skirt is not lined (and should be)  and it's a bit overpriced for the quality. but on the other hand  it's very cute and f
Really beautiful skirt. unique print (red) and stylish. keep in mind this is knit  stretchy  form fitting. as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric. i purchased a large (i am 5'7 and 154lbs) and don't like skirts too tight so i sized up. the large is fine however  i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesn't quite fit as slim as i would like. i suspect the m would be better. if you have a stomach it will show! i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on
Ok so this top runs extremely large. for reference i am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extra-small!!! besides the sizing issue  the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal. i definitely recommend! (ps. beware it does wrinkle easily lol...)
I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large  or something? ! i ordered an xs  my usual size  xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose  the upper arms are a bit snug  and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place  but when you look at the model  it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received  and another reviewer  the seam was puffy  making for a strange look. in theory  the shirt should have worked  but didn't. i loved the pattern  not the fit.
Was really excited to get this  but got it on and i was swimming in it. i'm not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don't know if i'll try a size down.
I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
Once or twice a year  retailer dons out a true 80s masterpiece!  the sweater is sturdy  bright and bold. quality and craftsmanship are amazing and the fit is tts!  i cannot wait for the cooler weather to wear this beauty with some skinny jeans!!
I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.
I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.
This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right  although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall.
I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness  fit  and embroidery of the top  but was debating on returning because of that weird  stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it  so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec
Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned
The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!
I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp  still boxy.
I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house  they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
Love the cute cat pattern and quality of the blouse. unfortunately the front was too short and the back didn't fall properly. also  i found the arms to be tight. i'm usually an xs and a size 2 in maeve blouses. i would've ordered the the 4 but it's sold out. definitely size up if possible.
I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :)
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.
I purchased the dusty rose. i thought the picture represented the color accurately. the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape. it felt very luxurious. the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable.  in the end i am disappointed in the care information provided by the site. it listed the garment as machine washable but the care label in the garment states it is dry clean only. i would not have purchased it if i would have know that. i am going to have to return it for this rea
This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning
I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms  i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me  this was a no go :(
I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately  i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab  this might not be a great choice for you.
I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however  some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also  it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture  it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as
I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
I ordered this in blue  and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style  but i tried a few items on my last order  this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom  which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style  this item is good quality  soft  comfortable material  and a great spring or fall blue.
I love this dress! i do agree with the other reviewers - it does come up higher on the sides. it has a hi-lo hem style on me  but i'm short (5'3") and got the petite xxs and it's not too short to wear as a dress. it's super cute!! if you're short(er) and don't mind showing a little leg  i highly recommend it :)
The material feels nice and i love the flared arms.
Super cute but order at least one size up
This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering. comfortable fit as well. love it!
It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received  but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.
I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
Love this dress! i'm 5'7"  135 lbs and typically wear either a small or x-small in maeve. since this one has lots of extra fabric  i ordered it in an xs and xxs. they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top  so i ended up keeping the xs. it's great dress  lots of room and swings nicely.
Cute and comfortable. paired with tights and boots for work  will also look cute with flats or sandals in the spring. the fabric is a nice weigh  not too flimsy. might be a bit short on a taller gal.
The picture says it all. fits tts. love it  love it  love it!
Can't wait to wear this top!! i found it to run tts for me  but i am a dd bust and need the extra material. happy with this purchase.
I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.
Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10"). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.
Hi  i bought this top in a couple of colors. i wear a 12/14 or xl. i bought these in a xl. they are huge. but i liked them well enough and returned them for larges and they fit beautifully.
I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material  yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7  130 pounds  athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up  i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it  a slight sheen  and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be  but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
This was just what i wanted. a simple design (so many of retailer's suits have way too much going on) and this one fit the bill. sexy  strappy and clean. i can't wait to live in this top this summer.
Loved this dress and was even happier to learn i could order it in petite!!
I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall  one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring  and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great  but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person  the violet
I've been looking for a light colored flowy cardigan for awhile and finally found this one is perfect. the materials is soft and has just the right about of details for me with the gently ruffled edges  tie front an some bunching around the sleeves. color is between ivory and tan. i am petite height and medium framed with broad shoulders and since they didn't have petite in stock  i bought regular s. it fits well enough  though i probably could have bought an xs. my new favorite card!
I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining  which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s
Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute  someone had clearly bought this  worn it  and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!
This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.
This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldn't lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.
I love the look of this dress on model but sadly  fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8"  155  34c  reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter  usually a size 2  could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw  "novelty print" means "ice cream novelty"  little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected.
5'7"  135  34c  27-28 waist. love. a thin pullover (early fall weight) great for layering or on its on. darling with a skirt or jeans. buttons down the back for looks. bought the small. tts. fits like in the picture - hits at the hip. colors in photo are accurate. would be darling oversized too. it has just the right amount of fun without entering the stratosphere of crazy-cat-lady level. no bows on the back. i'd hand wash this one. if you still love bows  but don't want to be mistaken for being
I went with the xs because i didn't want the v neck in the front to be too low. it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace.
Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was "hanging out"
Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath  but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad  just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic  but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms  but apparently i don't.
Beautifully made  incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places  which feels strange)  but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i'm gonna return and buy the size down.
This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
The colors on this sweater are cute  the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.
Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design  lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out.
This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
I'm not sure what it is with ag. i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans  in blue  black and white denim. i wish i could say they're all great  but unfortunately there's a big variation in how they wash  depending on the fabric content. i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring  but after washing them once i can see they won't be a favorite pair. even with cold water and hanging them to dry  the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes. at this price po
Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer  and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.
These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you  retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering  and the most important feature of any pant  makes my butt look good. don't hesitate  buy these today before they are out of stock.     the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality.
I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist  but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
My firned tried this on and her first comment was "take it off  it is scratchy"  so i didn't bother trying it on. it is  however  beautiful  if you are not sensitive to scratchy material. fit was true to size.
Material is kind of thick. stretchy. the orange i ordered was just too bright for me. i'm 8/10 and got the 10. i think the 8 would've worked better. sending back  mostly bc the color didn't look good on me.
Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.
I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said  i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck  but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o
The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8"  140 and wear a size 6  tts. i like the cut and it's long enough  which can sometimes be a problem for me.
The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2  my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference  i am a 34 a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0  which fits perfectly.
This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent  the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry  the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.
I really loved this top. however  i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad  i really wanted this look.
This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side  not the front. very unflattering on me.
I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them  but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile.
Love the print  length  and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!
Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size  the fabric has very little give but is comfortable.
I don't normally review my purchases  but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made  i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made  good quality dress for the high price tag.
I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes
This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.
I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref  5'8"  135 lbs  34-b)  but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is  and certainly lovely.
This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester  and it is  but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large  so go a size smaller than you would normally  and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester  why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth
I love these jeans! their fit is fabulous and they are very comfortable! my new favorite brand of jeans!
I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice  i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.
Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested  you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe.
This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me.
I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats. so glad velvet is in this year!
In love with this blouse  i first got in ivory went back and got in black  you can dress casual or up.
I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer  but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.
I really wanted to love this suit  but it honestly looked really matronly in person.
Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring! they fit tts. i'm 5'7 and i bought my normal 25.
This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!
I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.
This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!
I  too  saw this jacket on the recent retailer email teaser and instantly i was in love. i put it in my cart and was contemplating buying it but was unsure on size etc since there was only one review. i came back to find it was no longer available and i was devastated. i was at my local mall today and decided to pop in. much to my delight  they had a rack full of this coveted jacket. it's very cute  stylish  not very thick and the quality was ...just ok. there was a slightly worn look  that perhap
I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated  it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.
I paired this gorgeous top with a black v-neck cardigan  mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazing...i honestly lost count of the compliments that i received!!  beading is sewn on tightly  and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends.  i am 5'3"/108 and took the regular size small.  highly recommend!!
Very flattering. i am 36c and short torso and the small fit like a glove . the medium was a bit loose and gapped some on the side of my breasts. need to wear strapless bra. really cute style and goes with several of the patterned capri pants i bought at retailer this spring !!
I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light  comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable  too!
I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows  but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing  and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them  i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel
This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.
I just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up. i feel they ran small as i am usually a 29 in most and got the 31 in these. the 30 fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure. the 31 is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me. they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects. did not care fo
I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.
I have the blue version. i love the bold  pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.
I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.    the description does not say "lined " and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the "yellow with white piping" sweater coat. this is hard  coarse  itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back  and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only
Very cute dress  but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.
Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy  uber casual  super soft
I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top  the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4  125 lbs  34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i
Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!
Pretty top. quality material  it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy  if you don't size down  the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.
I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.
Great skirt  fits as expected. very cute  can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!
This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking  light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge  the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck  you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
The outer layer runs large up top; also  the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is  with a cardi  denim jacket  leggings/tights and boots  etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4  particularly in the chest (i'm 34a)  and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5'7"). the neckline is cut somewhat low  but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (don't feel need for cami). very
First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret
The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.
I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!
This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy  however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too "blousy." highly recommend this-
This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear  but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!
I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
Soft  stretch denim  70's fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this   but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27  my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn't zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won't have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area  . for full disclosure   i am a  size 36b  with broad shoulders and  a broad back
The velvet isn't as soft or plush as i thought it would be but these are comfy pants. i won't wear them until next winter  which is fine.
I stalked this when it went out of stock for a few weeks and was so excited when it came back in stock. but when it arrived  it just didn't look as good. it's very oversized. and it's itchy and kind of synthetic-looking. i felt like it added bulk when i tried it on. the collar also didn't fold gently like it does in the pictures. returned it!
Love this dress!!! must try on to see how cute is really is.
So a bit of a bone to pick with retailer. i am normally a petite xs (32b chest). however the petite sizing was not available online so i ordered a regular xs thinking i could always have it altered. i could barely button across the chest. huh?! when i went to return it at the store  i noticed they had xs petite on the rack so decided to try it. it fits perfect - like how it should! i can button fine across the chest and there is a little extra room.  i have no idea why the sizing is so off between
Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops  but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c  and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer  but not so much you need a cami.
Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person  i'm only 5'4". really wanted to like this...
This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however  the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7"  34c  28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size  meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands)  but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit  and are made of a great weighty denim  with very little stretch  the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash  all the lines butterfly
This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 12 in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to
As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't
I thought this dress was beautiful and the quality is amazing. i thought it was going to be black and gold  but it has a lot of brown in it as well. i ordered a petite. i'm 5'61/2" and the petite was just above my knees whereas the regular came below my knees. this is a dress i can wear to many events.
Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9" and thought it was cropped  boxy  and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer  more like a cardigan.
Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it
After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight  soft  good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.
I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.
Bought as a gift. really soft and cozy. i am sure she will love it!
I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive  which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups  adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.
Very comfy! can wear the dress both ways! the front is a deep swoop neck cut. the back is a v-neck cut. i flipped the dress around to the v-neck was more flattering on me due to having a smaller chest. got an size 4.
Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work  but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.
These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store  but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black  so that's kind of weird.
This top is really cute and i love the design. however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling.
This dress isn't as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are  it doesn't look great on me. for reference  i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason  the high neckline isn't flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.
I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two  if not three  sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body  other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough  especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w
A little boxy. a little short in the waist. a little overpriced. but  the shoulder ruffle and the color are so flattering and in the mirror it just says summertime casual chic and cute.
I purchased the green online  in my usual medium. i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons. first  i couldn't justify the price as it's really not unique enough. it kind of reminds me of a pajama top. also  i thought it was 3/4 sleeve  which it is not  it's long sleeve. and lastly  it appears to be regular length on the model. i'm maybe 5'4 at best and it's shorter and boxy. i gave it 4 stars because i really like it for what it is  but just not what i expected. it is cute  spor
I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even
This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit)  eye-catching design. like the other reviewer  i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier  but overall a chic dress.
Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.
Gorgeous  soft (yak hair  whaa?)  versatile sweater. lean fit  not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops  so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too  but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8"  140 lbs  34c. i'll wear this with everything  mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots.
I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe  and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.
I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer  but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.
I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co
I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long  lean  and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m  but ordered a l. it still fits snug  so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape  as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer.
I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.
This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time.
Comfortable  stretchy fabric. i ordered the xs and will probably take the sides in at least a couple of inches for a snugger fit...the fit is looser than it looks on the model.
I bought this dress on clearance and think it will be cute next summer  on a super-hot day with ballet flats. i have no idea what it's doing in the fall collection. am looking forward to wearing it 10 months from now!!
This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.
I love this dress. my favorite retailer purchase in years. it is perfect. looks great- no need for ironing and is really sexy for the length and amount of material. i would buy it 10 more times if i could.     yes!
I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top.
This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy  but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.
Soft  cozy  and the heathered off-white/palest gray is a great cool-toned neutral. the only surprise was that it is lightweight; not nearly as warm as it looks. the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining  the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams  the ouside looks like a sweatshirt. it does work great as a top layer though. 50% polyester  38% cotton  12% rayon. . got this in a size 's' to fit my hips and it works out great. i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37ish  wi
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.
Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6  xs  small in retailer  5'6" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room  but i ne
I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!
I'm 5'5"  125 lbs  34c and the xs fit perfectly. very soft  feminine top. i got many compliments the first day i wore it. wire it for business casual  but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more 70's look. highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top.
Customers beware  there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures  a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.
Flattering fit and design  but the material is thin and they are semi-sheer. great for lounging and the beach! very comfy!
This dress has a great design and fits very well and looks great. although the material is not cheap it is very warm and doesn't breath very well which is good in the winter. the only complaint i have is there was a small snag in it  but i was able to fix it my self.
Like other reviewers  i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however  the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
While there are a countless number of "winter-white wear-with everything" sweaters  this is the best one i have seen yet. it is a substantial weight without being coat-like. it is cozy and can be crossed over in front to wrap if desired and it is not itchy as it is cotton. and it's hand washable! i would say it' runs true to size. i wear a 0-2 and petite ( 5 ft 2 in). i purchased the xs but not in petite becasue i wanted the length. it fits fine in the shoulders but the sleeves hit me at my knuc
I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.
#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts  this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful  but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit  the embroidery  the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
I didn't hate it  but i don't love it. i purchased it in 2 colors b/c i thought i'd fall in love. it is just ok. maybe it's b/c i have a larger chest  but i felt like it was too small in the chest area and too loose elsewhere. not the maxi fit i normally go for. however  the material is great and it's a simple sunday dress to lounge around in and run errands comfortably.
The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t
Love these pants. ordered in petite . love style  great fit but so long .   keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.   decided to order the black & green as well.
I'm 5'10"  140lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size 6 and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!
I bought the tiny brand "cassia" tank last week in a small  and it fits beautifully. i ordered this "sorcha" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.
So.. i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love. utter i-have-to-have-it love. before dropping $200 superfast  i gave myself some time to think it over. well  of course i decided to order it  and of course my size was sold out. most of the sizes were sold out  actually. they did have a petite left  so after i dried my eyes  i decided to wing it. the petite actually fit. the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with (although the top is so structured that it ac
Have had many compliments on this tee! feels dressed up without feeling too fancy
I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however  lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store  they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i
This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
I love the colors  and saw the xxs p in a store  so tried it on  but sadly  that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms  that may work  but with muscles  it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 115 lbs  30 dd flat
Got the petite size. dress is swing style  so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person  more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy  just pretty and different. nice silk (matte  not shiny).
This bodysuit will be a staple for me this winter. i wear it own its own and under just about everything. i just ordered another one!
This dress is a lovely creation! however  i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"  weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!    otherwise  this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk  it would be un
I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
Great cut & fit! the length is perfect  too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.
This is a very comfortable top -versatile in that you can dress it up or down. i'm happy with it!
Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim  not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the "bat wing" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material  it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft  to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible  "it
This cute top fits great. it's got a nice fit on arms  shoulders  and bust  then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area. the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset. cute top!
I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on  but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so  if you have wide hips  this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l  it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.
Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!
This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher
I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!
I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.
Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.
This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said "wow" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off  but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress.
This is a really great dress - especially for the holiday season - you can do work and post work events with it easily. i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium. it is very comfortable and the quality feels great. boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look.
Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.
Had to send back for exchange. way too big. i'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made.
The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
Easy to wear  but still has a lot of style. i see this becoming a new basic.
I bought this sweater in the navy blue and love it! it's soft and not itchy  and the tie back detailing gives it that extra something special. i'm 5'7 and 38 d  waist line 27/28 inches  and the size m is a perfect fit! wore it yesterday to my son's 3rd birthday party with jeans and received a lot of compliments.
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.
I'm petite  but even if i weren't  i think this runs very large  isn't form flattering at all  and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
The color and quality of these jeans is great. they were too large in my normal size. more of a boyfriend fit so size down.
This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.
This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste  it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand  usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top
I like design of the dress  softness and color ( i got grey)  the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.
I recently ordered this and am so glad i did. i absolutely love it! my hips and butt are not tiny  so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half  but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle a-line  contrary to other comments. i am 5'4" and 130' but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim. the waist sits just barely below my natural waist. very happy with this purchase; would buy more if there were additional colors - who doesn't love an elastic-waisted skirt
I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!  true to size and nice length.  the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.  nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.  very nice!
I love this blouse  but after i got it i decided i really didn't need another white long blouse. it was more of a want than a need. very stylish and comfy with nice neckline. i love retailer anything. i'm obsessed with this store and every single thing in it. even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors.
I am 5'2" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s
Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly  if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect  it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate
I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also  there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...
This gem is beyond lovely! i saw this 5 years ago and regretted not buying it 5 years ago and then i was looking on here as i do on a weekly basis and bam it was there  i gasped hahahaha but really this is an amazing statement piece. i am usually a l but got the m as it is a bit big and its your preference on how you want to wear it. i will be wearing this to death for autumn winter and forever its just one of those. soft and not itchy and i have sensitive skin.
I bought these pants in the green and in black. they are the most comfortable work pants ever! almost as if you are wearing leggings and not pants. the material is really thick hiding any imperfections.the satin detail allows for them to be a little more dressy. i am 5'6" and 155 and i ordered a 10. they are a little large in the waist but a perfect fit everywhere else. the also hit right below my ankle bone. i highly recommend these pants for anybody who is on the go for there job a lot because
Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned.
Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric  the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan  jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-
Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.
Love these jeans  comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.
This is a beautiful looking dress  but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4  112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked  even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress  and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me  the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver. wouldn't recommend it.
Love this top-i love the colors  flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
I'm on the fence about this dress but overall i like it. the material  design and all is great! it's a light seersucker type fabric and short sleeves are perfect for summer. now the bad thing about this dress is partly the print combined with the swing/large cut. if you aren't too careful it can look like a housedress or hospital gown. i find i definitely need a belt to define my waist to avoid this.
... for the model to look like this? pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip. cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin
If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
I love fitted top dresses like this but i find them hard to fit well on my body. this one fit perfectly  straps can be let out or taken in easily  and i get tons of comments on the print!
Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick  but not heavy  and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice  but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5"4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th
It's cute. it works with jeans  linen pants  flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a "must have". but i'm keeping it because it works!
I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.
I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly  going back.
I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color  but a nice one. the top is form-fitting  with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap  but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes  size up as it's a snug fit.
This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also  the colors in t
Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt. i love it...got lots and lots of compliments. great quality
In retailer's defense  silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs  fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top  never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much  i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
Very interesting material.  the very subtle/light window pane pattern is perfect.
I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect  straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.
I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident  oops  meant to be? the color is very nice  not too bright holiday red  but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p  length was not too high/cropped  perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater  so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me  the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs  30dd 
Although this isn't a soft top  i didn't find it that scratchy or bothersome at all. it's 55% linen! and  for linen it's soft. it's also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement.     i bought the black  and i do not find this sheer or see-thru. it's a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day. i found it running tts  with the sleeves and length a little long (i'm petite) making perfect for the av
Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.
Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid  but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned 
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!
I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows  but the material is that soft  but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised  i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - it's really adorable!
I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn't feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it's wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it's vegan leather  they feel compelled to touch it and can't get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special  interesting touch. it's become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn't love getting a compliment every
I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.
I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
Really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material  i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.
Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric  lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.
Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8" 135 lbs.  with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material  light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!
It was love at first sight for me! i am petite 5'2 about 115 lbs and the small worked well for me. i usually order xs in most items in retailer  but because they only had a small left in the store  i thought it would work as i do like my coats a little bigger. when i tried it on  it was the perfect size! like the other reviewer said  i could see why it may not work for those with a fuller chest area. i am on the smaller side in that area and the fact that i went up to a small instead of xs may hav
I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.
The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.
Classic and beautiful style. structured material that will always fall just right. looks beautiful and will take you to any occasion - heels or flats  office or dinner party. definitely shows off your shoulders.
The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but  the fabric looks like old  matted carpet. i will be returning.
Received this yesterday  wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable  yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting  but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots.
This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.
I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.
Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!
I ordered this in a small and i am 32b and the fit is perfect. lovely details and very well made but the online pics make it look like a soft periwinkle blue  however when i pulled it out of the shipping bag  it was more gray-blue. dare i say...country blue. even the pictures i took in this top make the color look different than it really is. i almost sent it back and i love the color blue but it was soooo not what i was expecting. it grew on me so i'm keeping it in spite of it.
This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist
Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.
Beautiful color and flattering fit on me. i bought the size 4 and it fits my 5'5" 125 lb frame perfectly. i love that it has sleeves!! no worries about upper arms. it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk. it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile. i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too. love it. worth every penny..
I wanted to love this dress  however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through  so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.
I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so  when you wear the necessary base layer  the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea
Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!
I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.
I really like these jeans  but order a size down. i'm typically a 14 and these were just too big. they stretch as it is and although they should have a baggier fit  they are just too baggie.
It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review  it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too.
I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!
Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again  a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.
Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants  jeans  or something dressier.
Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
I was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season. i wasn't sure what i thought when trying it on  but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it. for me the waistline was a bit high  and it had a bit of a frumpy feel. i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasn't amazing.
I really like the design and colors and the material is so soft and comfy. the top is a little on the short side so wearing a tank underneath is an option if you don't want your stomach to show when you raise your arms.
I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
Relaxed fit  soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price  i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.
Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it.
I love  love  love these jeans! they fit like a dream and the fabric is so soft and giving. the waist comes up higher and stays snug  which means no muffin top. plus they look awesome! i truly hope paige comes out with more like this!!
Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10  sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up  it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality  though  as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition  as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still  a versatile dress  for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.
I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c  127#. the moment i put it on  it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit  and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a "sweatshirt" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt.
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
I usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice  i didn't want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out. it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile - i'll definitely wear this dress to work  out with friends  and you could also wear it to bridal/baby shower events as well. i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable. i do think it runs large - i am 5'9  145lbs with a very straight (no hips) / athletic build (have an athlete butt)
I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.
The quality and aesthetic of this dress is wonderful. the fit and look are classic. i am 5'10'' and the dress falls mid thigh. this is a beautiful dress for a special event  simple but with sparkle at the neckline and an unusual print. i am very happy with this purchase.
First of all  the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit  with colors of white  gold (deep yellow)  raspberry (or almost maroon)  and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before  and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater  but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned  or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it  and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an
I didn't think top was very flattering and  while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.
This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look "thick". highly recommend!
I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.
These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.
I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are
This dress is the perfect combo of flattering  comfort  and quality. i purchased the turquoise color  which is vibrant! this will be my go to dress for spring. the material is super soft  flowy and medium weight. i ordered petite s  probably could have got xs. i love  love  love this dress!
I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust  and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem  medium it is.
The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.
I purchased this dress in my usual petite size 2. it fit me quite well for the most part  a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress. there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area (i'm small chested). also  the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap (below the bow) which made me think i needed to size up. i'm not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end. the
I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
Love this sweater. super comfy. can wear with everything.
I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.    first  it is way too short for me  especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay  to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also  the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th
I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too
This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.
I thought this dress was beautiful  but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride  i would have kept it  but....
I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5'4" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it's like burnt chemicals. i don't know if it's just this pair  or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can't get rid of the smell. :(
It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.
This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!
This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!!
This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.
This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed  i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer  i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter  especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.
Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.
At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.
Skirt is made well and beautiful colors. runs a tad small. i am typically a 4/6 and i ordered the 8 (based on other reviews) and it fit well.
This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.
Darling jacket/coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.
The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.
The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it  the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of
Definitely size down  the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.
I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however  after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing  so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person  and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"  138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly  though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.
I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline  so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale  but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather  though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n
My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.
I bought this in-store after seeing it online  and am in love with the shape! the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion.  for reference i'm 5'6" 120lbs and a bcup. i got the xs.   the torso was too baggy and lost it's shape with a small.    as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white.     it has a modern cut and is very versatile. i plan to wear
I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.
This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large.
My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!
This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath
I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer  and this is not it. like others  it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps  but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.    - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however 
This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives
I'm 5'7"  120 lbs  size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!
Beautiful - ordered a s  i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water  shrunk inches  yes inches! love maeve clothing  this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink  it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
This blouse is flattering and fits great. i also have the other color in cream with the floral design. very nice!
This sweater is much more beautiful in person. the quality is very good and the fur is nice too!! i am 5'8 inches and 155 lbs and the medium fit me perfect.
I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up  they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri
This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom  but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer
I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.
Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat  even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!
This dress was so lovely in person  but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!
I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.
Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather  i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous  but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!
I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin
I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt  which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still  the quality seemed to be good.
Love it! cute  flattering  and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.    the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock)  and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it.
I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c
I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd  i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
I wanted to love this dress so much  but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer  and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a "swing" dress and is very wide  much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite)  and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture  but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.
I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said "that's a piece of tablecloth." it's going back.
This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase  and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try  and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7"  120lbs  slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short  but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi
I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height (5'1) and petite stature. i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly! so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made. love that there is no zipper- just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck. plan on wearing this for my 30th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket!
This dress looked so cute on the model  but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style  rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4"  i wish this would have worked  but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style  this could be s
This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me
I was so excited for this romper  but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price  and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt  but it is very pretty with capris.
Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!
These pants have substance in the material  it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only "complaint' is they don't come in petites  so on my short legs  teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase but keeping in mind for future...
I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline  because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas  the adorable print  the handy bra-strap holders  and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3" and 120 lb  small up top  not especially curvy but not straight either  and i ordered my usual 2p. yup  the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.
Very cute  very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
Loved this online and it did not disappoint. lightweight and super flattering. fabric is sheer with a lovely windowpane pattern. top front of the bodice is lined. looks great with a pair of jeans. super easy to care for. toss in washer in a mesh bag and it comes our perfectly. will likely be a go-to summer piece.
Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.
It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.
I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist  but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais
I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup  smallish in other proportions (125  5'6") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?
I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this spring/summer. these overalls completely fit the bill. i would normally wear a size 24  but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look. i went with a a size 25 and they are exactly what i wanted. i feel like i can move around feely in these. they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight. i highly recommend these!
This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!
I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5" and 140 pounds.
I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders  therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also  runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.
This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.
I was out of town when my coat arrived  and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet  but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7" and heavier than i'd like  but the xl fit perfectly!
The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5"  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.
I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle  and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy  but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe  this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it  even for the price.
The fabric is so soft  but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn't flatter my body.
I love denim and this tunic/dress/shirt is soft and fits really well except its almost too long to be a tunic/shirt but too short to be a dress - at least for me but i have a long torso - still not sure if i should keep it.
Dress is very pretty  but very short  almost tunic length.
I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length  hem  neckline  etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.  the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well
I was so sad to have to return these pilcro jeans. my calves are just too athletic for these jeans. they weren't comfortable. they were a little loose in the waist. so  sizing up  would not have fit the tight in the calves problem. i have two pairs of stetson crop flares and they fit perfectly. in fact i love the pilcro stetson crop flare style. wish retailer would sell more of this style.
While the blue color pictured is stunning  i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small "v" ( a great detail  especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next  this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a "just right" weight (solid enough to be opaque  but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!
These are very well constructed  medium weight  besutiful leggings.
The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
This top is very pretty  but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy)  but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"  125lbs  34b. i preferred the regular length  but if you like your tops to end at your waistband  then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top  so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.
Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.
Gorgeous dress  but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.
I love this dress. i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was 56" but it was perfect. i am 5'0 and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect. however  in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer  but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas. the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low.
The previous review by beardedlady said it best: "yes  i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i don't care. this is a fun  creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment."       in my own opinion  i don't think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so i'm happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look. i am 38-27-35/36c/135# and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size 10 re
This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
Love these pants  they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware  if you are curvy  you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.
I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"  170# bra size 34f and 40-41" hips.
I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews  i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however  i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm  which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.    i ordered size petite xxs
These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight  just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length   hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however  if i were any heavier  i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin  in most cases i would size up.
I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"  they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable.
I got the tan one. my friend got the same skirt. she's tiny  i'm not (i have hips). we both got a size 6  and it fit us both. it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers (above my navel - not above hers). i do have a small waist. the skirt has a lot of movement  but isn't poofy. it is not see-through. it has that retailer charm  where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming. a new wardrobe staple. can dress it up or down. only problem is the zipper in the back -
Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes  you might want to size down. if i did order a small  the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer  so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w
I am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. mih usually runs small so i ordered the size 30 knowing the length wld be too long. well the fit is great. i am a little curvy w/ slender legs. the size 30 sits just below my navel  snug throughout hips & thighs  then gradually begins to flare below the knee to the bottom. super long  will have to cut off abt 4-5" to suit me. i don't wear sky-high shoes. i wear low to flat sandals in summer & medium heel booties in cooler weather. maybe i'll cut them & try them a
As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.
This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust  shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top
Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end  it went back.
Fits well (true to size)  very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!
I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.
Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!)
Lovely  comfortable top.  not flattering on my full figure but would be flattering on most--especially younger women who want to emphasize their curves~~
I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can't recommend a size  because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming  the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers  and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i'm 5'6". it appeared overstretched  and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth
It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
These are just perfect  exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.
I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular size 27 (5'4"  27/35  116bs) and they fit me just perfect so they are tts. they are super soft and there's just enough stretch in these that i'm able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely. the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look. the color is just as shown in the picture  a nice shade of blue that's in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft. i'm only 5"4" but found the regular
I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles)  the length is perfect  the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all  unlike another reviewer) the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look  which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide  swingy style  but with the sl
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material  which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if  like me  your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders  so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!
I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.
This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!
I love this dress. it's cool and comfortable in this crazy heat! the fabric has a great feel to it. i do wish it was just a little longer..     (i'm 5'8"  145#  and bought a medium)
Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate  but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.
I just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique. for reference  i'm  5' 5"; 122 lbs; 26" waist; 38"hips and i have a long torso and short legs. i ordered a 29 petite. the fit  was tight  but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so "hippy" i would have kept them. the model is  slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute  but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.
I am short so this ends up being really long on me  but i like that i can show off some amazing heels with this skirt. lately  i have been getting into grey so that it puts more attention on my accessories. the cut of this skirt is amazing  and the thick waistband is non-traditional which makes something that normally would be boring  really stand out (plus it helps hide baby fat!). the fabric is a medium weight  but it does flow nicely  and it does not seem to wrinkle easily which is a huge plu
Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6" 145 lbs  athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great  just like glove  it does not make me look fat. the quality is great sweater is warm  cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral  it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw
Love love love this sweater! lots of compliments as well :))
These pants are super flattering. they can be worn to work or on the weekend dressed up or down. they are slimming and fit very nicely. my only complaint is that they start to look worn  the black fades  as you wash them over time. please don't stop carrying them!!
This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.
This is a really well made  great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight  not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!
How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!
Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea
I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.
I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.
I was very nervous to buy this top  but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def
I wore this dress for my small winter wedding and it was perfect! i thought it ran a little large though because i had to return it 2 times to get the right size! once i got the right size it fit perfectly. i loved the champagne color and shine.
I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy  don't buy. however  if you want more of a fitted blouse feel  then go for it.
Very cool top! i purchased this in the black  which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy  but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
Love this sweater. ordered white  size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual  really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.
I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!
The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.
There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too  but even this color turned me off.
I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured  only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late  everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured  a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just "alright". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me
Absolutely gorgeous top! i have purchased so many retailer tops and this is the 1st review i have ever written. this top is just that deserving for a review. stunning in so many ways. i am 5' 2"  118 lbs and purchased a size 4. fits perfectly. maybe runs a tad small. can not wait to wear!
What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.
The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length  slits  tie  stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas  it isn't meant to be...
A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but  i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back  and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough  so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer  and the embroidered dots are well done.
Such a cute plaid print  i couldn't resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out. i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge. i ended up returning it. i think the xs petite may have worked but it's sold out so i'll never know. it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not. the colors are magnificent.
I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium  which was just ok. overall  the top half was comfortable and fit nicely  but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo  a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...
Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.
I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.  yes  it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway.   the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.  i am 5'4 size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.
The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light  the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy  but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect.
Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium.
Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit  but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.
I'm glad i saw this item in stores  otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp  and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable  and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!
I love the unusual print  but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back  and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!
So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.
There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced.
I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...
I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt "wing out" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.
I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.
I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.
I bought a medium  my usual size  and had to exchange for a small. i love flowy sweaters  but this one truly fits one size big. the arms and body of the sweater fit larger. beautiful sweater with jeans or legging- can't wait to wear!
I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
I love white for summer and by august i am tired of wearing sleeveless...so this caught my eye. it is very easy to wear and pretty on. i wore it with black tie up shoes and accessories. super comfy & stylish.
I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans  unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure  i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
When this dressed first debuted  i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed  works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum  i knew this would be an ideal pair
I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
Was super excited to try this on  but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but  i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!
These jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim. soft and comfortable but not too much stretch...just enough. i'm short so i have to cuff them. i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length  but they look cute cuffed too.
Comfortable and loose fitting- perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on. can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch. good color  too!
I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable  absolutely gorgeous on  and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.
I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5"3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!
I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
Love the sleeves - good length and fit. it's a basic tee that has added flare.
Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.
Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom  but i feel like it will stretch a little over time  it is also very long which i love  because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great  i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct  if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted  size down  but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo
I like the feel  stretch and softness of this dress  it's very comfortable. sadly  as others have commented  the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4  but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7" 120 lbs  34d and ordered a 6.
I like this coat  especially the collar and cuffs. but the buttons were too eye-catching for me. i wanted something more subtle. still  i recommend the coat.
As the other reviewer said  this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer  and i am short... i tried on xxs regular  xs petite and xs regular.    xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders  cehst)  but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular  a bit longer  but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this  but probably something beter wil lcome along.    great for those who want to show their assets
While this top is pretty  it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad  because i really wanted to like it.
I ordered this on-line  in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine  and the fabric is acceptable  but as much as i wanted to like it  and keep it  i ultimately returned it. it is just too  too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour  and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants  leggings  or skinny jeans  but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts  w
I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering  but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
I tried this on as it was on sale and my size was on the store. i didn't end up buying it as it felt jsut meh compared to so many cute cardigans. i do have a couple of grey ones and tried on grey  so perhaps i jsut dind't need it... pros: short so would work with dresses and high waist.
This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle  but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes  it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!
Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.
I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person  which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!
The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
I love this dress  it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time. i try to not buy dry clean only pieces  but i had to make an exception here!! perfect for early spring days.
I fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it. one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips  yet as a size 30 in pants the slip was still fine. the other concern was the length. i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height  however  it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length. overall  i ordered a size 6 and it fit well in
This is the perfect dress to transition into fall  either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand  ranna gill  but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price  i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.
I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame  and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
I'm a rather small person--5'2"  about 100 lbs  32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place  i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs  planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee  but even as petite as i am  i coul
I know what you're thinking- the review below this says 'runs small.' not true. i am a size 4 fitted top and ordered a size small at first. it arrived and was really boxy and so big it wasn't flattering in any way. i ordered the xsmall because i really wanted this top to work. the fabric quality is amazing. so soft and strong! the xsmall is definitely a better fit but the cut is still a little boxy by nature. it's an excellent high quality chambray shirt if you're in the market!
Beautiful design and fit.
The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.
Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.
Finally  a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.  it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.
I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.
Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
This sweater is super cozy and comfy and my new favorite sweater! the green is a dark khaki and really pretty. it's long enough to wear with leggings  but not boxy or frumpy.
This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price  it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.
Like a baby doll top  with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears  i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.
I'm 5'4"  130 lbs. 34 d. i bought the medium. i think i could have gotten the small but i didn't have time to re-order. it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half. i love the length and the fabric.!
Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand  but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in "yellow" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better  but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute  but the qua
Lovely color and sweet top  but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.
If you are shaped anything like me  you will have to size up quite a bit on this one. i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up 2 or more sizes to get the proper fit. the fabric has no "give" and feels a little cheap in my opinion. for your reference  i am a curvy  athletic build with broad shoulders.
I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.
I am 5'4" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter
I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out  it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.
I ordered the gray/plum colorway and while i'm disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication  the vest is very soft and warm. the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and i'm tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look. i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave.
I was looking for a cross between a light  fall-wool jacket and a cardigan and this is it! the red version looks festive in the winter  and the hood adds a bit of spunk. looks great both open and buttoned. i received many compliments on this the first time i wore it.
Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9  a 10 and the m fit just right.
I love tracy reese. this skirt did not disappoint. i saw it originally in store & fell in love. i waited to see if it would go on sale... and it did!  i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.  i am 5'5" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn
I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on  the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.
I wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.
The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping
I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!
Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute  fashionable tights that aren't "heavy" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great  don't roll or bunch  don't shrink  have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!
I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good  the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo  the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be  which fall on the seam and when i tried this on  the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.
The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height t eh other was so low  i could barely put my hand in it. however  the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice  but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs  but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size  so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.    for reference i am 115 lbs  30 dd< 26.5 in waist.
It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style  but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.
This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.
I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
Cute and super comfortable...so it's the best of both worlds. it fits true to size  but i bought a size up to add a little extra length. love the soft blue color and ruffles.
The photos don't look it  but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.     disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!
This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered  my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.
Pretty fabric  nice style  took it back.
I was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater  but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots  i am sold! it is so soft and full of movement. it has a very unique design. the purple color is gorgeous and inviting. i will enjoy this sweater all winter long!! i am usually a small/medium and the medium fits a bit big  but looks beautiful on. the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal.
This is a gorgeous lace dress  well made  true to size. a little tight in the neck but not unbearable. lovely for any occasion. i got this to wear to a fancy wedding  it will be my go to dress for fancy occasions.
I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
I tried this on in the burgundy color in the store  and hoping it goes on sale soon! the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops. i run the gamut in retailer sizes   but lean towards mediums. this top fit beautifully in a small! it drapes nicely and doesn't hug the body  nor is it too flowy  looking maternity-ish. i am 5'4" 140 and 34dd for reference . it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual. if it doesn't go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b
Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27" waist  37" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit  especially around the waist  but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look
So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back
I ordered a large and it was skin tight  if that's the look you're going for..
This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.
I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it
I never would have given these pants a second look online  in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me  i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer
I purchased this shirt in a medium  in the wine color. i love the drape and fit of the shirt. it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy. it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts i've bought at retailer. you could easily dress this up or down. i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat. it majorly shrunk! now i can't wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more. if you purc
I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
Very well made dress but runs extremely small! definitely size up!
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
This dress is absolutely gorgeous. the fabric is light and comfortable. the colors are even more vibrant in person. it has a keyhole opening in front  which might not be for everyone  but which i really liked. the only things i would caution buyers about  is that it is not lined  and for shorter buyers (i'm 5' 3") it runs a bit long  so if you can pick up the petite  that might mean a better fit.
I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and  although  i'm not a huge fan of gauze  the fit was perfect.  i had to  snatch it!
These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!
Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.
Unique and stylish dress  looks much better on than in the pictures.
I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs  36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.    the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as
This is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants. i love the tucks in front with brass buttons. you don't have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head  i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter . i think this will be my go-to shirt this season.
This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately  i caught the cutouts a few times  and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable  but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan  this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s
Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes  but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size  do size up.
This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect  falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly  which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip  to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra
I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going
I have one in every color  that is how much i love them! i love that they zip on the side and are high waited. i am 5'4 and got a 4 and they hit me just right.
I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down  but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to  nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
I like this top  but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1"  and have a larger bust  34 c. this shirt fits in the length  but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts  and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color  and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage  my bras are not covered by this to
Saw this on the mannequin and tried it on just for kicks:  ________  pros:  - breathable fabric  all cotton  with a lovely color.  ________  cons:  - runs large  which is the style of the top anyhow. however  i was swimming in the medium (and i normally fit in size 10/12 or m/l tops with retailer stuff. you can easily size down and have plenty of room left. but if you like it really baggy  then stick with your normal size. for reference  i'm a 36c and hourglass and had ample room in a medium.  - s
These are comfy and cool. i got the blue  which is more royal than navy. in opinion  it goes well with almost anything! i can wear all the neutral colors  in addition to orange  red  yellow and patterns. they are flattering and like other reviewers  i went up a size to 28 in the blue. perfect length  not too short. got the same version last year in white  27. 5'4"  128lbs
I am of average height  but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print  but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!
I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge 
I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were "felted" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28") and the skirt sits at the smallest part
Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros  and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer  i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!
I love the swing and the pretty color of the dress. it's fun to dress up or dress down. the fabric is a little thin so you will need good undergarments if you have lumps and bumps.
I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty  really perfect color for fall. i like that it's not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it's difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it's not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it's all polyester  which is just cheap fabric. if it wasn't for that  i'd give it 5 stars.
I really did not need another coat at all  but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft  cozy and fluid  but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks  to a football game  or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -
I love this top! i ordered it in a medium  and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old  5'2"  125 lbs  for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!
I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.
This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model  but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.
Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders  normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.
Very flattering fit. a little billowy but i'm okay with that because it hides my stomach. have to wear a camisole underneath as you can see through the lacey parts. overall i love the shirt design  fabric and fit.
I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately  the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area  but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture  i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank
I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.
I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.
These weren't what i expected  but i kind of really like them. they have a very high rise  and so they end up being high waisted. the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable. however  the fabric is very stretchy  and i'm not sure i can wear them to work. but they're a little fancy for the weekend. the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black. all things i can work with  but they are a little different than i imagined. they are quite long -- i'm 5'8 and will likely have to
This shirt drapes beautifully. forgiving fabric in a beautiful taupe. it is a bit low cut  i wear a camisole underneath. true to size.
I originally purchased this sweater in a size small (5'4 125lbs) and i was swimming in it! i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big. i do love the quality though and its so soft! it's made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel. it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy! this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home. great product!
I ordered this in the blue  it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back  but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top  but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted  34-d  5'3  125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.
Nice fabric and construction. the small fit me  a usual size 6. only problem: there is no way to easily use the bathroom in this thing! seriously. that's why i'm returning it.
Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a "box-like" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.  the material isn't what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light  somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.  i am very happy with the color!
I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.
Love everything about this. the color is gorgeous - great fall addition to any wardrobe. the tassels are cool - usually don't like things like that.    i wear a small or medium in retailer  usually small  and i purchased the small.
So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.
I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however  the embroidery was beautiful
Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.
I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but  the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
Great color and fit and feminine
These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green  red and gray. my "go to" pants this winter.
Listen to all the reviews  size down! i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty  i was wrong!!! i could camp out in the large! it was super large!!!    got the medium and its fit amazingly! its a tad bit tight in the chest(barely tight) but im a 38dd and this is not an unusual thing for. i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect! cant wait to wear it! loving the velvet trend this fall! thinking about getting the blue too!
This top immediately caught my eye in the store.  not only that  it was the pink color and i don't usually gravitate towards pink.  i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round.  i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later.  you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy.
Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.
I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand  elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring
I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.
I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!
Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist  sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater  but it had to go back because it looked  um  used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned  sadly.
I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight  i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.
The pictures don't do this cardi justice. it's so lovely and ladylike. it's seems very well made. please can we have more from this designer??
This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however  the fit is off. i'm 5"1  107lbs  32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it  if it fit properly.
The top is a pretty design. it's a low v-neck. but it would be nice for layering. it was just way to tight. runs small. order up a size.
I must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for.  i adored it online and even on the hanger.  putting it on  it just looked frumpy on me (i tried my usual small first).  decided i must need a smaller size  so i sized down to an xs.  this one looked much better on  but was nearly impossible to get in and out of  the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice).  i decided i wasn't willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it.  i passed.
Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen  cotton  and acrylic  so it's not heavy  it's weighty. anyways  it seemed to run large just due to gravity  so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
I originally bought the tan at the store. i loved it so much and ordered the red  but went down a size as it does run big. perfect for the summer.
These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.
The buttons on the side give this top style. great color and fabric make it perfect paired with denim.
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean  seriously good. every time i wear these  my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually  i'm 27/28  in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.
I love cotton fabric  so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color  and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once  and today when i put it on again  i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.
I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h)  so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top  i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine  but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is  it is very cute otherwise! i just mail
I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape  bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure  but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick  in fact it is quite sheer for "velvet". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a  xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w
I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however  the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them  and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve.
This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.
I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this  and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically  when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.
I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.
This is different from any bra i've had before  in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful  and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered  so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire  either  based on the s-m-l sizing  but it has one.
I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit
The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model  maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers  and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again  could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy  ill just have to make it work.
I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .     one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you  these are not the pants
I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price  and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that  the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!
I was disappointed in this vest  it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big  doesn't drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering  looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair!
Love this dress! ?? i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on. i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase. i am glad i did. the 1st day i wore it i received numerous compliments!
I really wish i could keep this top. the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand  shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash. if you have the time to dry clean then i would 100% recommend this top. another tip if you buy this (since i didn't read the description) the top has buttons all down the front. i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldn't recommend this top to someone who is busty.
The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.
I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style  the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.
This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big  but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
I really wanted to love this dress  but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses. it runs small throughout  and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed  but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8 10 and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress  w
Beautiful fabric! unfortunately  i had to return it. after just one wear  it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!
This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy  so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available  but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence  go for it. totally worth it..
I love this top! the fabric is so soft and it's perfect with white pants. yes it does run wide and is short  but if you get the correct size it looks just like it does on the model!
This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.
I tried these on in the store  and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)
This is a really beautiful kimono. soft and flattering. as well as eye catching.  can be dressed up or down.  absolutely recommend
Love the fit of this top  love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top  which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.
Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store  it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand  and me being a more plus sized gal  their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops ..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color
This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure  but since i've got curves/an athletic build  it simply did not work. too bad  because it is such a pretty dress!
Beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
I am 5'8" 135 lbs  broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio. this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering. love love love  definitely happy with myself for the splurge. can't wait to wear it out!!!
I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings  jeans  or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!
This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4". the large fit like a small on me  and not like a typical oversized sweater type small  but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight  and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the
I orderd this product in a size large  because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest (32ddd)  however the opposite happened. because it doesn't have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected  however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect. also  the v is a very nice depth- not too deep or too shallow. overall  i'm happy with it because it's a n
I always look for things to hide "parts" without making my "parts" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect  the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.
I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!
I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.
Dress is comfortable  feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute  fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.
I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items  but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it's smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however  when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt  it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o
Wow. bailey 44 knocks it out of the park with this sensual  i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut
Love this brand and i keep coming back. i don't have the most tone tush  but maaji always gives a cute little lift. i order a size up (usually a small so i order a medium).
The torso runs a bit long  but this is otherwise a comfortable  and cute dress.
A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long  but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!
I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight  the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!
I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric  and for a white/lightly striped dress  not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry  holes started appearing everywhere  both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest  in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget
Love the colors and design  however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows  and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it.
A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.
I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit  the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are  so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this)  the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well  they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!
Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think  it's way baggy
Cute stripes and soft  but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out  people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me.
This dress is really beautiful. i plan on wearing it to my nephew's wedding in april. my only complaint would be is that it runs extremely small. i am 5 feet tall and 90 pounds  slim build  and normally wear a 00p or 0p. i ended up with the 2p  and it fits perfectly. my advice to anyone considering purchasing is to order several different sizes and return the ones that don't fit.
Beautiful dress; however  the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.
I bought this in the white  size m (140lbs.  5'8"  34b) because i wanted a baggy fit  which i got  so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white  which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size  this tee nips in at the waist.however  the quality of this tee is lacking  as it is the typical  cheap  marled  slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially  but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium  got the m/l and fits well.
I'm 5'-4"  130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also  the straight across  rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown  not a hundred dollar dress.
This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person. i thought it would be very lightweight  but it has a nice weight to it. this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on!
I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6  135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.  nice weight fabric for fall.
I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen  i usually don't like linen much  it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.
I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?
I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder  but start further do
Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall  at church  and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!
The fabric   feel and design of this dress is sooo cute  but so large that sadly  it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.
Very long shirt  i have to tuck it in. i love the lipstick design and its great quality material. its really soft and cotton breathable.
The body is huge  while the arms fit. being returned!
I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately  this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly  the fit is slim  not relaxed. i'm 5'4"  at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally  the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece  however this w
I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!
As soon as i opened the package  i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5" and 128lb  ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3
The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.
Fits great and i love the length. very cute skirt!
I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic  but in person  it really caught my eye.
The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it  but it is so much more! first  the fabric is more of a raw silk  which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin  and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"  133 lbs and a 36c  and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides  so i probably should've returned it for a 4  but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o
I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top.   the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off.   i felt that it flowed perfectly  not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)  i am around 5'6" and a little on the broad side  so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari
This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.
I went to the store specifically to try this dress on  because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit. it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life  but unfortunately i couldn't fill out the top. there was gaping even when i went down to a size 0  even though i mostly wear a 4 and sometimes a 2 in retailer dresses. (the 0 fit me everywhere else  which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra  or for someone with more cup size?
I carry my weight on my lower half  usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.
This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.
These shirts are perfect for a casual day. basically t.la shirts are my daily go to. i usually wear a small but i buy these in medium because i like the looser fit. a little pricey so after buying 1 at full price i waited until they were on sale to buy more.
This top is a lot more striking in person. on  it's quite stunning. it is a tad short but that's part of the aesthetic and i don't find it unflattering. however  the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate  but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath
This is a beautiful dress with gorgeous details but it is not as long as it appears in the photo. i am 5'9"and ordered an xl. the dress comes just below my knees.
I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also  the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and
This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!
I didn't buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it. great color  great quality  great fit. oh and great price too! i say - go for it.
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
Bought this dress for my daughter (teenager) and it is perfect. it is a cute dress  perfect for summer parties  special occasions. it seems to run a little small and  wrinkle easily  but over all  she and i both are happy with the dress.
I was so excited to get this top... and while it is soooo amazingly soft  i still could not keep it. i must admit that i am only 5'2"  so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this... but i felt like a matador  which is definitely not what i was going for... maybe if your tall and lean  this would work.  but for me  no way.
I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.
I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very  very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit  it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!
I love the idea but it is more of a over sweater than to wear by itself like model... too big/baggy
My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.
This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!
Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.
I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly. i love this blouse.
Let's begin with the fabric....it's heavy  but not in a burdensome way. as soon as you put it on  you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on. next: aesthetics---this dress is flowy and feminine. and a bonus  it made me look bustier than i am; perhaps because of the stripes. i didn't find myself pulling this dress up all the time. once i put it on  it stayed in place perfectly. bottom line: this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought. and it's on sale--grab this one
I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area  then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
I love hand knit sweaters. they look expensive. this sweater is pricey and i shied away from the original price. at the reduced price  it is worth it. my sweater is bright blue and pure white so not sure what other reviewer got. however  it is itchy. i admit that i have somewhat sensitive skin so if i cannot wear a silk layer under it  or find a way to make it less itchy on me  i will have to reluctantly return it. i normally wear large but the medium fit fine.
These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!
Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured)  the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.
Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers  it's itchy  but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s  my usual size.
As other reviews have mentioned  this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly  returned asap.
Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
Love the pattern  i thought i would be hosed and need a petite  but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side  so great for summer (office is cooold)  love subtle squares  glad they still had my size at sale! :-)
Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.
I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering  they are a perfect long length  and the colors are stunning. after several wears  it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session  i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews  even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online  so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's "party in the back." i'm 5'3" so it was pretty much floor length on me.
I'm a size xl  so my review might not apply to all people. i purchase my retailer tops in size xl and sometimes they fit great and sometimes they don't. when i put this top on it looked like i was wearing an open cardigan; nowhere near buttoning. i have some sewing experience  so i removed all 4 box pleats which gave me an additional 8 inches of fabric. after doing this i was able to easily button up the blouse and have it lay nicely. but i literally needed that extra 8 inches of fabric in the mid
I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling  lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit  and very well made. the fit is very flattering  with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the "size up" recommendations from other consumers - but  i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and  i had plenty of breathing room i
This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however  so i would caution that it may not be work "office" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses  it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or
I love this dress and have already worn it a couple times since purchasing. it is great because it has sleeves and i don't have to wear a sweater with it! my only complaint is the lining on the inside is pretty form fitting. i would have liked it to be more flowy like the dress.
Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down  which is hard to find too. perfect length  beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look
I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress  but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality  a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky
I love love this top  it look so much better than expected. i bought black because red wasn't available in my size. the style  print  and fit are perfect. the shirt-style hides flaws  and the top looks very good and stylish. it can be worn for formal or casual occasions. i keep looking to see if the red one is available in my size  i would buy it in every color. perfect!!
This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation  but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that  like many byron lars sheath dresses  the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t
This blouse  with a scalloped hem  is a good blouse to wear by itself. it goes well with higher waisted bottoms. it is very boxy. i like that but did buy a petite instead of s regular to compensate (i swing both ways on oetite/regular sizing). i'm so-so about the patch pockets  the material is fairly heavy  but they do add to the look of the top. it's well made and nicely finished.
My favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i'm trying it on in the house  i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
Unexpected delight! great top that can be dressed up or down. the only con is a little small through the bust.
So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~
I loved the look of this top when i saw it online  however  when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful  but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!
This shirt is adorable but it's really just a cotton t-shirt. based on the picture online  i thought it would have more weight  be a more substantial fabric. again  it's adorable but not sure how long it will last.
I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact  that after the first size didn't fit  i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl  l  m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful  but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
Absolutely love this shirt. i purchased this in the black and blue. perfect for holiday parties.
I love this sweater coat. i just put on a pair of leggings and boots and i'm good to go. it's warm and flattering and comfortable and i can wear it anywhere  it works at the office  out to eat  shopping or even just hanging around.  fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater  not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth
Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.    the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess.     looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders  but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also  front b
Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser  but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the  vee is just right on me  tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length  ordered thinking another black tee   but it's going to be well used and great for evenings.
I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool  soft  not itchy  light weight  lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees  etc. are extra long  so it's nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot.
So  this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said  all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely  and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!
I know the photos for this dress show it as a very "casual" dress  but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple  but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality  fits well - done deal for me!
This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.
Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it  and know it will work well for both the office  church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes  and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great  even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall  i'm satisfied with my purchase!
I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!
Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
I ordered this in a s (for reference  i am 5'7"  128-130 lb  32dd  with a 27" waist)  and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest  but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs  but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model  but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric  which has a jus
This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.
I so wanted to keep this  but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it  wish it came in an xxs or petite.
This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.
This jacket is amazing! i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top. when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap. it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly! it's loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big. it is so soft and cozy  and the hood is my favorite part!
This dress looked gorgeous  light and lacy in the picture  but when it arrived  the "lace" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy  sequined material. it was uncomfortable  scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress  so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si
I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
I didn't end up keeping this  and i feel like i might regret it. ;) i have a similar sweater. this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit. the bummer for me was that it didn't have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped  so the flaps seemed to flop around. the s was perfect. not too tight. i'm 5'8"  140 lbs  34c.
I absolutely love this top! i own it in coral and white. it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable. i am so happy i bought this top!
This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life  not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
This blouse was so cute  i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned  there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person  but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.
Gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry  it will). between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.
The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse  and great quality.
I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one  the length  the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also 
All i really need to say is this is the perfect layering piece. i love that you have a choice in the neckline that you want to wear. form flattering and is true to size.
Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love
It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso  but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
As stated in my review title  they're amazing! they're incredibly well made  have just the right amount of stretch  and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work  or at least where i work  where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length  which being at 5'3 isn't surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldn't recommend these enough
I loved the look of this dress online  and it's everything i hoped and more in person.  i'm 5'10"  155# and pear-shaped.  while the bottom of this dress is voluminous  it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shape.  the length was absolutely perfect  it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa.
Lovely pants  incredibly comfy fabric  but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated  but it is clearly not 34" that i need. had to take it back to the store.
5'7"  34c  28 jeans  size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular  knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything  the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over
I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered  it was comical. so so boxy. literally  shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person  it may look super cute! just didn't work on my slim build. :(
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
I received this today and totally bummed it's not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you'd have up in your closet for years. good quality  feels nice  and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they'd put a little detail on the back  maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i'm very pleased.
This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?
This tunic is comfortable and casual. it is as pictured and flattering. the two materials make it flattering. i ordered the white  and it is see through. it really does need a camisole  which i found a little distracting given the fact that it is already layered. i which i had ordered another color  because it is cute.
This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute  i ordered it too.
I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail  however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.
I tried the size 2  regular in store. they were a bit roomy and since i am 5'3"  i was glad that they were offered in petite. they did not carry petites in the store so they ordered a petite 0 for me. i tried them on when i received them and they fit like they had been tailor made for me. the rise was a bit short but not a deal breaker  however  they were very long and i hoped that i had shoes that were high enough. i often hem pants but figure when i buy petites there is no need. also  the hem
While i love the design  this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips  butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5  135 lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.
Beautiful blend of colors and the texture of the shirt is so soft...perfect fall weather garment!
I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"  125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse  too.
This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.
I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.
I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.
Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress  fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.
I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.
This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy  and i am by no means overweight  but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c  5 feet  115). honestly  it just made me look fat. the design is cute  but this is going back..
Love this sweater! you can wear it with just about everything. i have worn it with dresses  leggings and jeans. you can dress it up or down. wonderful quality for the price.
There was. a blue one in my store sale room and i decided to try it on  as i had read great review. bummer is i really do need hte petite in this. cut is flattering  adn material softer that i thought. next year...
The small is huge on me and the sweater is very itchy. cute idea but not for me. i will return it.
I'd wish i'd gotten this in a small.. i'm a true medium and its pretty big on me. that being said i still love it and will continue to wear it. the v part of the neck lays kind of funny after washing. i might try to sew it down.
I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.
So comfy  great quality  not see thru at all  has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway  dont need a bra.
I just tried this top in red in xs and i think it's cute. it's fairly fitted in my opinion; the sleeves are pretty snug but there's stretch to them. i was fine with the fabric and the size xs (i'm ~105 lbs  34aa) even though sometimes i fit better in xspetite. the only downside is that the washing instructions say to remove the tie before machine washing  and i guess that put me off a little (the idea of re-lacing it every time). so i haven't yet bought it. the red is vibrant  tomato red and the
Shimmery & lightweight t-shirts. i got the aqua & brown t's. good for layering.
The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo
Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn't as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn't a stretchier denim. but  my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good.
This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.
I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work  but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally  i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a "versatile" v and
I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual  2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown  so it is not constricting at all.
I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style  i felt it was too "little house on the prairie". pretty but not the look i was going for.
These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4)  they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off  these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!
This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground  i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats  this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.
Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.
I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts  but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!
This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said  this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
I purchased the mango. it is flattering with my olive skin and golden brown hair. i am keeping it. i'm used to linen so no surprises there. i agree with a reviewer that said it will work in summer and fall. i could wear this walking on the beach  to a summer casual dinner party. i plan on wearing gold sandals and gold jewelry. this will make the feel more summertime. then i will wear boots with it in the fall. i'm very happy with the choice. my store didn't have the blue. the fit is tts. i'm 5 f
Love this dress. i wear a size large  but had to return and order a medium  planning to wear with boots. it's a light dress  cute for work. the only downside is that it wrinkles easily.
I love tracy reese dresses  but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations  shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
I am 5'8"  140lbs  pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly  just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic  and there is no unflattering poofing  which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw  however  is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it
This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small  but it was still gigantic.
Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.
This sweater is warm and cozy. it has flattering lines the way it closes  the banded detail at the hem and sleeve details. please remember it is wool so right next to your skin my be itchy. however it is the best sweater for a slim flattering warm look.
These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it
This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
I cannot keep my hands off this gorgeous kimono - i want to wear it every day! it goes with so much of my wardrobe. it's thin  and cool (both meanings of cool apply). i like to keep my arms covered (i think my upper arms are too fat) and this kimono does just that  while keeping me cool as a cucumber  i wear a sleeveless white or gray cami under it and it is soooo comfortable  i could sleep in it. it would also look great with lime green cami and white pants. so far  i wear it with blue jeans an
This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.
I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24  i wouldn't bother with these.
This top is one of my favorites  i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer  and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me  i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.
This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.  the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however  it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.  overall  im happy with the purc
This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind  it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.
This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
I really love cloth & stone  and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture  i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however  there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w
I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
I loved this top so much i ended up getting it in three colors. it's comfortable and so easy to wear. it does run large though in my opinion. i normally wear a 6 in tops and i bought this is a 2.
This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
I wanted to love this dress  and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me  however  the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close  so sad
I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.
The design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however  it's extremely see thru.
I don't normally write reviews  but this shirt was so terrible  that i felt inspired.     first off  the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly  there is no shape whatsoever  unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall  this shirt is an insult to the female form.     retailer  what is with all of these shapeless  frocks in cheap f
These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 32 in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
These bottoms are comfortable  soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.
I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.
Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small  the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs.
I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.
This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try  and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!
The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye on-line  but wasn't available in the store  so i tried the green one  mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small. i did have to size up one or two sizes. i fell in love with the green dress and bought it. it is so comfortable  great quality fabric (not too thin or too heavy). looks great on. i have received several compliments.
I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d  31 waist  38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said  even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first  it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back  get all four panels even  tied  hiding my bra  etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga  i may not have managed. once on  the style looked great. as
I got this dress in the holly green and it's a lovely shade - perfect for fall and winter. this is why i gave it the high rating. however  be warned that the lining is very form fitting. i thought the dress had more of a fit and flare design to mask flaws like a belly and larger backside  but that's not the case. i had to return it  but for more slender-shaped ladies  the dress is likely a winner.
I love wide-leg linen pants and i'm always in the market for them. i've purchased these in two colors and have been happy with them so far. the waistband is fold-over and snug. not too tight or too loose. the length is longer than advertised. i'm 5'10" and typically take a 33.5 or 34" inseam. these are long enough for me so they have to be a 33" at least. others may complain  but i'm happy!
I love this top and despite the higher price point  it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white  black  gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey  but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per
My daughter loves these  she wears them around the house all day when she doesn't have to go out.
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
Got this dress for a party.  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit.  it not only fit  it looks great and is very comfortable.  have to love an a-line skirt and a top with short sleeves.  it covers everything while looking sexy.  and i didn't have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldn't be.  got compliments all night.  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff.  buy it now.  its perfect for holiday p
They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
Really like this top. fun flair  nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4"). will send petite back.
I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams  but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect  however  the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.  dress looks exactly as in the picture.
I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.    great buy
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.
This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however  it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"  140lbs  32dd). going back unfortunately.
I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
I love swing dresses and normally order l   but this one turned out to be way too large. and as other customers said the sleeves are short   so the whole look is out of proportion. the colors are much brighter than they appear in the photo. the dark patches are a bright peacock color and the hot pink is just too much for my taste.the material design is not as classy looking as it comes across on line.so sad because i love this dress pictured on line and this is not it.   the quality of the slip
This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray  bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.
I love the color and design of this suit  however  the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself! i am 5'7" 110 lbs.  with a very small bust and a short waist. i think the suit runs very small  as i am a size xs/s in most of retailers clothing. i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite!
I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however  to my delight  i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online  i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest  wide hips  small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh
I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.
I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very "80's"!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors  but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you  but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size  but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on.
I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4" 112 lbs. with a slim  straight  athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they don't have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs weren't cut right  i don't have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans  they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these  i ju
The label says 100% linen  but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit  but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it.     i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape  but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much  i just bought another one in mauve.
First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin
Love this dress! it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected  but not unwearable  though i am smaller chested. it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining.
First  i absolutely love this dress  and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended  and the dress fits perfectly. however  when i zipped the dress up  the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly  so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!
I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it  no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size  they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.
I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.
This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!
I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"  145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews  i was aware the hem was unfinished  and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style  to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments  it is my favorite dress right now!
Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual.
This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
At 5'3" and 155 pounds with a short waist  it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable  very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 32 so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these  you won't be disappointed!
I was really looking forward to these tees working  after reading the reviews. unfortunately  they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.
This dress is amazing! i have a b cup and didn't quite fill out the top enough. but that is a small tailoring fix. i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly
This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
It's very beautifully designed  simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it didn't disappoint me because everything else is so good.
Lovely embroidery with a classic look  great addition to your wardrobe.
I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
Hi  these are really nice. the material is thick. they will probably be warm in the heat. they are made of 100% polyester. if they were made out of linen they would be perfect.
I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite  32c  5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp  but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.
Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel  yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine  sexy  comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small  wish i would've went for a petite x-small  however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3  110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.
I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton.
This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!
I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email  and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it  as it is a beautiful coat online. however  once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168  and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.     perso
This skirt has a beautiful  flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and  of course  the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year  dressed up with jewels  or down with boots and a casual sweater.
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
1. i'm 5'5" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10  but i sized up to a size 12 in this skirt and while it fit fine in the waist  it was just too snug across the hips.  2. the fabric is heavy weight  and i agree that the zipper should be longer.  3. the length is a bit long and dowdy for a pencil skirt. it's very straight. it does not taper like pencil skirts normally do.  4. i would have kept this if it fit a curvier figure.
Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.
Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.
I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.
I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite  short-waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.    i returned the dress
I try to find something to like about everything i buy  even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt  but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch
Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.
I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.
I bought this dress for my mom! she usually does not even try dresses on because she feels that they highlight her "problem areas"  but she is going on a vacation soon and i thought she could should bring something different for her trip. thankfully  the embroidered waters shirtdress completely surprised her! the fabric is soft and light  the blue is vibrant and perfect for spring/summer  and the cutwork detailing is flirty without being too risky or revealing. she's really excited about this--a
I absolutely love these pants! they are super comfortable  lightweight  have big pockets  and are so cute. can wear them anywhere- i'm taking mine to india next week!
These are the very stretchy  almost spongy  type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
I love the colors in this top  but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare  and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed  and sadly will be returning this. for reference  i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops  but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
I absolutely love these shorts. i do  however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1" and normally wear a 24  25  0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available  but that was not an option. they are a little baggy  but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on.
This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.
I love this tee! while it is true to size i feel  it is meant to have a loose fit. that being said  it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape. super comfy  flattering and classic.
I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.
Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel  so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s  my typical size  which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.
This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.
This is a flattering  comfortable  soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that  however  i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy  and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
Let me start off by saying i never write reviews  but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi
I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available.
This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and  in fact  recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat  i washed the top in a
This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however  the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
I bought this dress in both the red and black motifs and love them both. i'm 5'7" and usually a medium  but i found the medium to run a little larger than expected. it's fine if you want the dress to hang looser on your body  otherwise  consider trying it a size down.
I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model  and from the reviews. i found it to be super big  and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5"10  155lbs. i sent it back.
I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.
I received this sweater in last week  when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy   it is not   the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value.
I am normally between a size 0 and 2  so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around  so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out  was bagging in the crotch area  sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out  i was curious about it  but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however  i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy  but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again  i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe 6 made in my xxsp.    you really have to see this in person. even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots. the colors are gorgeous. i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer (and it works withe the copper color - too).     the dress is really a swing shape - not close fitting - no "waistline" so it is very comfortable. the sleeves are fitted  but stretchy so should not be a
It's a beautiful top  but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though)  i fear it may easily rip.
This is a good skirt  although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well  has a good shape  and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok  and i'll keep it  but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work  but probably not to nicer events.
Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
I'm 5'1" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.
This is the perfect little throw-on dress. flattering  uber-comfortable  nice fabric. i found that it runs slightly large.
Very cute but true it's very sheer. good with a simple nude tube underneath to avoid bra straps showing. i got in both colors. great with slim pants or jeans. may need to order up a size if long torso like me. the small was a bit short.
This top is so soft and luxuriously comfy! i love wearing it around the house  haven't really "dressed" it up yet with jeans or jewelry. it runs slightly big  but if you like the oversized look  this is definitely perfect.
Love this shirt and the details on the collar.
I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print  and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6  and the small fits me perfectly. also  i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies  and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!
This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.
I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
This dress really was huge  and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft  but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is.
This is the first romper i've ever purchased and i'm instantly in love. it's flows  the colors are vibrant and the pockets are practical. looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the season as well as next year.
This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
I like how styling and comfortable it is  i bought it in both colors. definitely a nice piece for fall/winter in this houston weather.
This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy  and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on  you'll love it!
This top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full  shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.
This top is amazing. it's a little stretchy but doesn't cling and it's surprisingly flattering on my curvy figure. i have a large chest and the shirt fits perfectly with or without a cami underneath. the material is very soft and the print is vibrant and fun. the shirt does run a little large. the only slight issue i have is that it is a little shorter than i usually like on my long torso. other than that  it's pretty much perfect.
I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived  the black already looked faded and old. also  the embroidery looks like a grandma  but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff  which causes a boxy  unflattering look. had to return it.
I was worried the green might be on the shiny side  but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops  this top runs small  so order up a size. in most of retailer tops  i'm a small or medium  but in this  i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side  but got on sale  so all smiles here.
I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors. it is soft can be worn both ways  and i like the crisscross detail. very comfortable  not formfitting.   i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small.
I adore this sweater. it is so soft and cozy. i ordered two because i really need some good winter sweaters that are forgiving on the pooch but not wool (darn allergies). so i ordered this in the white and black (camel is a bad color for me).    tried on the first sweater when they arrived and it was so comfy i didn't want to take it off. then i looked in the mirror. i'm a tall gal  5' 11" with broad shoulders and i weigh about 165  and this sweater was so unflattering! it just made me look big
I love how this dress is photographed  but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress  but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.
Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-)
Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.
This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
This dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery  there is nothing wrong with the dress  other than the fact that there is nothing special about it. very blah fit. the fabric feels very polyester. no real shape to it. the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo  so no problems there  just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it. perhaps at a much lower price point  but at this price point  its disappointing. size 2 fit perfectly  and i am 5'2" 112. in general  just
I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.
I absolutely love this sweater  very comfortable and flattering!!! i'm thinking of buying it in another color!!!
This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.
I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on  but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite  but surprise  it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on  whcich i did yesterday. mistake  because i love it  and even if it is not peite  it workedc (with heels)  and online it already says only a few left  so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.  cut is very flattering  and colors are great. also can be worn any seas
I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.
Love  love  love this top. so flattering and forgiving. bought it in white - great for summer!
I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.
As stated by others  this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long  although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations  retailer  for a winner!
I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful  the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35" long  and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy  but it was really  really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.
These "jeans" definitely look more like pants and are very snug  but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall  and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on  but are a tad tighter than i anticipated.
I ordered a medium  as i like my shirts a bit loose. it is a beautiful shirt  and looks great in person. however  this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean. exchanged for a small!
I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo  but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly  but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan  and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft  of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line
I love clothing that has little surprises  and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is
I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return
This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.
This is a nice  easy  go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall. comfy  but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee.
This is such a great top! it runs huge though. i normally wear a small but bought the xs. it fits ok. i would prefer the xxs  but i bought it on sale and retailer is sold out. for reference  i am 5`6 and about 138 lbs. very flowy soft fabric  great purchase.
I got the grey in my normal size large and it fits as shown. love the cowl neck although it's a bit awkward and oversized. the cowl is a lighter shade of grey and a nice contrast. it felt a bit itchy and is a tad boxy and short. i decided to return.
This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all.
I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long  but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick  yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show  the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!
This dress does run large  but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is  and is nicely flowy  but might require a slip.
I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are "curvy on the bottom" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are
The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(
Perfect fit  nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more dressy than a regular legging.
I should have exchanged it for a smaller size  but i wanted to wear it  so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14  and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this  size down for sure.
I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec
Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore  showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the "side breast" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!
This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored  an xs looked better. i am 5'5" 118 lbs  34c  slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day.
It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
I ordered this sweater and it is beautiful.... i am returning though because it fits snug through chest  shoulders and upper arms. i am an xs - and that is what i ordered and it was tight through these areas. if you are busty it would be a definite problem.
I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress  but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin  taller person.
It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women  this rare pair of pants crosses the divide  flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here  i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
It's soft and not itchy at all (itchy sweater is my all time nightmare). the design makes you feel like a snow princess. i am 5'3  120lbs  34dd bra and take this in size small.
I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.
I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident  thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater  leggings  and boots all winter long and then when the wea
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.
So i recommend wearing with something more fitted  or with a flare (jeans)  or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside)  so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit  you see hte contrast. it is a bit short  and i am petite  i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise  it may have been too short.  colors are nice  and i love the material  it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it
This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
This tee is very comfortable and the colors are amazing! i initially purchased in the marigold yellow as i was instantly drawn to the color in store. it's a beautiful shade that will transition nicely into fall. i've since purchased the green which i liked on even more so than on the rack. overall  a nice quality everyday tee. the pocket and embroidered neck make it something retailer!!
We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable  yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as "south-of-france". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress  but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!
The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.
I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(
I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom  but whoa... even when sizing up  i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable  and if you have a smaller bust  it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.
Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big
I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i'd give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it's got a clasp in the back so there's no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage  left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly  have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone
Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well  definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
1. i'm 5'5" tall  140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands  and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12  so it runs very slim.  2. this dress is very long waisted  so the top bunched up funny.  3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place  and will not hide your bra strap.  4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders  but this is an off the shoulder top.  5. the underarms bunched funny.  6. the dress has h
I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me  there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft  although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok  the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body  it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there  it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch  lightweight  and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!
This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size  but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch  try on and return in store...this went back.
I love almost all tops from retailer  however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed  but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference  i am 5'2" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big.
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well  maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!
Based on previous reviews  i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay  the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall  i didn't find it flattering or anything special.
This is a cute dress  but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes  but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise  it was cute and simple  and the tulle was quite soft.  i think that i would have gone with a medium  but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference  i am 5'5"  ~135 lbs  34c  and 27" waist.
I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.
This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed  lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across  and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection  making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine  flattering  and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend.
I love a good peplum top  and was so excited when it arrived  but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering  because in every other way  it fit like a dream  but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.
This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter  though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose  but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.
I bought this lovely cardigan in the orange color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i wore it buttoned over a slim tank and got several compliments right off the bat. it is a sweet and unique take on the classic cardigan in a way only found at retailer. i usually wear a small and it fits true to size. i did have to return the one i purchased because it had a hole in the sleeve  but thankfully was able to order another. on sale  it's a no brainer!
I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest  but at the same time  are not too busy. they seem well-made  and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.
This top is gorgeous  but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5" at the bottom  right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area  the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest  and is styled that way  so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up  but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise  and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i
I love this tee  i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.
I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom  presumably from the buttons. i was torn  but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
This top fit nicely and was tts  but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.
This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately  it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it  but i'm sending it back.
I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but  i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim  this may work well  but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de
I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.
I like the cut and look of this shirt  and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs  30ss chest)  but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun  and the color is adorable  but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.
I fell in love with this tunic on instagram  and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned  the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images  and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish  but not at all over the top.    i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di
I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8  135  and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.
I normally wear 0 in retailer dresses. the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small. i bought a 2 and love it. i plan to wear it to a wedding.
Wow! great find and a true fit. i totally dislike pant shopping and these are a gem.  slimming  flattering and so comfortable  the style is great. great basic summer pant!
This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it. it is very soft and cozy. i went with the m/l cause i preferred the longer length  even though i also fit in the xs/s.   i have worn it many times  and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace. when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers  i throw it on when i get cold-its like a cozy hug. i highly recommend!
I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.
I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.
I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size  if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter  5'3"  i love the length.
I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.)
I wanted to love this dress  especially because it's been given good reviews. i ordered the blue and tried it on. the fit was pretty good and the color is pretty and deep. i did not like the seam that ran around the drop waist. it created a weird allusion that the two pockets in front was actually a continuous pouch around the dress. i also did not like the neckline - there is fabric added on the shoulders that's in a different fabric and makes it look like you're wearing a t-shirt underneath th
This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable!  my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos.
The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high
This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone  plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me  a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw
I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color  design and details. however  whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves  it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender  i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.
This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on  but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress  but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.
I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.
I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference  i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out.     however  my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine  that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
Wish this site had "ask a question about the product" feature like amazon does. just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color? it looks orange but descriptor says red. would appreciate feedback. thank you for your help.
I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it "looks like pajamas." the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual
The first surprise is that in person  the material is actually kind of woolen? at least  i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out  but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic  so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me  as the regular version was longer tha
The photos do an amazing job of selling this coat. in person it is just a little bit less than what i was hoping for. the navy blue color is lovely and elegant and fits the sophisticated femininity of this style. black or khaki would be too boring.  the fabric is soft and drapes and flows beautifully  but it is quite thin. if you hold the coat up to the light you can almost see through it! the thinness probably helps the flattering fit of the coat  but i don't know how effective that makes it at
I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress  the silhouette  the flouncy skirt; however  i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy  dark colors.
I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.
This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized  playful  chic  dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.
I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions  depending on what you pair it with  which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
I love the idea of ruffles  but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium  and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes  it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer  but it's pretty thick.
I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape  and is very comfortable. however  it's plain  and for the price and it being dry clean only  i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite  but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).
This skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large. i am a size 4  xs in retailer. my waist is 28 inches  5'7  140 pounds. the skirt is touching the floor. even if i wear high heels  i will have to wear it up my waist. the elastic band is weak  not sure if it will hold the skirt. it should be ok with a belt. i still recommend it cause it's so pretty.
This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however  after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
I found this dress to be very short waisted  much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color. it's a very relaxed dress. easy to throw on. as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair. but i love this designer. but it does run large. sizing down helps immensely.
So much prettier in person. love it! i'm a size 2 in retailer and a small in this vest  even over a sweater still left quite a bit of room.
This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .
I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash  so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist  slim hips  flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.
Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight  allows no room for extra tummy  hips  booty  or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top)  but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m  would have definitely sized up  as i really liked the look.
I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.
For years i've eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings. every single year in every single incredibly cool print - i've always wanted them. finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print  and i'm so glad i did. these are dreamy! they are so stretchy and so comfortable! they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit  but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue. the print is my favorite part. the colors are extremely fun  but still classy enough to not feel to
The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very "round" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater  which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater.
Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash  but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
I like the pattern on this shirt and the fit over all is pretty good. i wasn't sure if i liked the sleeves as they are very angled  much more so than i expected. still  the shirt is nice enough that i'm keeping it.
These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants  but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them  size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
This sweater is really cute  great fit and unique style. unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like. not the right shade for my skin tone.
I don't know that i'll keep this  although i really want to. i love the style and the fabric  and the length is perfect for me (i'm 5'3" and i ordered the petite length - it hits me below the knee). as another reviewer mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch. luckily for me  that wasn't an issue.    my trouble is this: the liner stops just above the slits on the side  and it's way more noticeable in person than in the photo. the liner is sewn in and yo
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!
Cute  easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt  or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though  it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length  long enough for work.
Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.
I thought i'd add a review because a lot of this landscape-print tee was still available at my local durham  nc store (the week after xmas anyway). it's a little different in person than how it appeared online (when it was still available). the white cotton is definitely a cream or off-white. and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown. the metallic is a subtle gold. it's definitely 3/4 sleeves  which i like and it has a curved bottom hem. the surprise to me was that it
I love the look of this jacket. it's incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it's a little different and fun. however  it's already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point  i would have expected better quality.
I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends  and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.
I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.
I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person  i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3" and 115lbs  this dress is not too short. however  the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so.
I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length  so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets  which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great  it's a line the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a
Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
My waist measures 28" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts  but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable  and the quality looks good.
I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well  and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down  but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!
This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff  and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge. . got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2"  currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s. . the one i got in the mail
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!
I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo
I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
The color is great  a nice alternative to all my black tights. good quality.
This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
After reading many of the reviews stating the dress can have the potato sack look  i certainly had concerns. particularly since i am petite  hourglass  athletic  and approaching 50. i decided t give the blue shade a try. the lighter shade is beautiful but was afraid it would wash me out with my darker hair and olive-toned skin. let me start by saying the blue is so beautiful and rich looking. the velvet has such dimension and is no ordinary velvet material. it is also lined. when i first tried i
I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter  which others do mention  but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape  i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material  is very nice and it's well made  but it's going back.
Was excited to try this interesting skirt  as a mega bailey 44 fan. however  this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the "vegan" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so 
Online this top looks fabulous  but in person  not so great. great color  nice quality for a lightweight top  but when i tried it on  the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found  for me  it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest  so didn't work. for reference  i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
Overall  quite good red skirt  though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"  120lbs).
This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted  which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6''  135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online  and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on  i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide  short  and crooked. after it was washed once  it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.
Love the dolman sleeves and its the perfect length. throw on a cute necklace and go.
I loved this trench on the web site  i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2" 135 lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks  tags intact  continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre
I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a "draft." they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.
This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!
Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the "v" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.
Just like in picture! super cute and comfortable sweater!
I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large  and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
This was way too big on me  so i gave it to a friend. not only does it fit her really well and look great  but it has become her new favorite sweater! love the casual everyday style  and am tempted to order one in a smaller size for myself.
I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.
I got the pink version. it is a pretty color  but the metallic border is painted  not a metallic yarn. the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy. it looks cheap to me--not what i expect from retailer. am returning.
I'm 5'1"  <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual.     the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that  love it enough to keep.
Picture says the model is 5'10  i am 5'8. the dress hit me shorter on my leg than it did on the model. i loved everything about this dress  it did run a little snug so i was between a small and an extra small. i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work? so i am sadly returning the dress.
This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
This top is my new favorite. i thought it might have too much volume  but it does not. it is very flattering. the color looks just like the picture.
Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back
I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp)  so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual  it gives a nice "dress-up" kick to any jeans  shorts  capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate  :-)
This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors.  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details.  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown.  i don't think it is too thin and i won't need to add a camisole.  i am 5'2" and weigh 120 and i got a small.  perfect.
I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...
Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.
I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
I so wanted to love this dress  despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.
This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
It's ok  fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide  hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3" 140# 39-28-35 an
This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos  but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked  but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns  embroidery and beading. also  it is long and does run large  but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite  and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.
This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however  it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame  because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.
These may be my new go-to pair of jeans. they have just enough stretch and softness that i can be comfortable in these all day. however  i noticed after the 2nd time i wore them  there were pills in the inner thigh area.
I ordered the xxs p  but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well  it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)  beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice  but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath  i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral  not red.
This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft  comfortably loose  but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!
Love this dress  the colors are stunning  the make is beautiful...i don't know where to start. the body part is a nice neutral color  and has beautiful beading  my concerns is snagging since the fabric is so flowy and the beading pokes out sort of... i love that they used different patterns on the layers  the skirt bottom layer has cute polka dots that are translated on the sleeves (bottom of the sleeves). sleeves  are  by the way  fun and bubble-like. the cut of the dress is not following the b
I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!
I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute  soft  vibrant  and a flattering a-line. however  this dress is sized oddly  running at least one or two sizes too small  particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up  and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time  i had some gaping at the straps  and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip
This dress is made well and fit nice. i am 64" and 135 lbs. i really wanted it keep it but it is going back. the colors in person are much more muted and with my pale blonde hair and fair skin the color was all wrong.
I love the fit of this sweater. i recently had a baby and am a little self-conscious of my stomach area. the sweater  in my usual size s  hides my problem area without being big and boxy. the weave seems like it will be prone to snags  so i'll have to be careful.
I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra  could be a little more supportive. pretty color  with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)
I love the cut and "swing" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty.
This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves  love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted  body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.
Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6" 127lb.  not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!
Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!
The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
This is one of those dresses that is just "nice" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it  it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but  it's a "work horse" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!
I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers  boots  dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body  and a little loose  but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.
That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.
I so wanted to love the striped peplum top  however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)
A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size 4 was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well  the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy  & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the 4 didn't). i went w/ the siz
I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned  the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!
This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual  its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little  more edge and character. fits true to size. i'm 5'5''  125 lbs and was happy with the small.
This is a very well made top  i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.
It's a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty.
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape  but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect.
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
Bought a pair of the gray and loved them  but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine.     so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem?     anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a "washed look" that's on purpose.     i'll still wear them  but an expe
Light weight jacket  perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile  - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made  fold cuffs back for the classic look.
This dress didn't work for me for several reasons  but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms  which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.    on the plus side  the fabric feels great  and it hangs well.
I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
I originally eyed this dress online - the lovely and comfortable weight of it can only be appreciated in person  however. it's a dress i'd be able to wear for hours on end.
Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok  though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!
Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier.
My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look"  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2"  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2")  this a a
I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.
This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes  size down.
I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there  but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves  and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low  but offered full coverage on my 34a bust  but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice  and it's a prett
Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.
The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer  but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.
This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful  and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts. it is very high waisted  and at 5'8" the length was similar to the model.
So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied  but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes!   fits tts.
Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
This is way shinier in person than i expected  but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted  but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content  but that's it.
Very well made  wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket  but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room  order a size up. the quality is nice  i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me  just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.
Got tons of complements and can work for many seasons  just throw a cardigan for fall -runs a little bit and would like if it was touch longer but overall very happy with this find!
This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!
Hi  when i received this top i tried it on  looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.
I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium  so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer  as a handful of retailer designers seem to do  simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup  as a medium i was a b cup. now  years later  as a size 16 i am a d cup
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.
This was a gift for a bachelorette. very pretty and sexy without being too over the top. love the print!
I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
What i liked:  1. midweight fabric. it's not lined and when i read polyester in the description  i was worried that it might be thin  but this is a stretchy midweight fabric.  2. pretty pretty print    what i did not like:  1. i don't know what dress the model is wearing  but this was an empire waist dress on me. i'm 5'7". because it was empire waist  the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me.  2. the sleeves are cut oddly. they look too wide for the dress  even on this model.  3
I am 5' 7" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute  you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit.
I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty  and while it's very lightweight  it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.
Runs a bit small. very slimming. love these. when will they be available in moss again?
Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings  i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said  "that's going to pill up." and i ignored her. and she was right.
I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.
This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet  but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also  the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however  i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.
Sweater fits great and is nice and soft. i am 5'11 and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me
Love the style and fit  but it does stretch out during wear. by the end of the day  it feels big.
I absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother  and ordered a 29 in these.
I just got this in the mail  absolutely gorgeous. the hook and eye closure is very secure  i have no problem walking or sitting in this dress. i ordered a aize 8 going by the previous reviews that this dress ran small  i could have ordered my normal 6  but the 8 fits pretty good just a tad big. the dress is more chocolate brown than black and the detail is really stunning!! you can't find unique dresses like this anymore  truly beautiful!!
Nice shirt seems well made. good just not a great fit for me.
This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small.   i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
I fell in love with dress immediately! it runs small  but is very flattering  even if you have a little you want to hide. i went up 1 size. so comfy and beautiful! love!!
Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic)  the pattern  and the colors. also  it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long  that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.
I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.
I bought a petite medium and the length was right  but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable  and didn't look completely terrible from the front  but from the side  it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing  but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it  the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.
I am 5'8" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)
This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect  and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color  but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique  special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!
I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.
I loved this dress immediately.  i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt.  only one complaint.  it's a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).
Really cute skirt  love that it has hidden pockets in the front. ended up just being a bit too wide on me. can't size down as fits everywhere else. will look great on someone  just not me! order true to size  fits great.
Tried them on in store. they were actually kind of sexy on. i have an hourglass figure and the way that these fit  felt sort of like a 50's/60's fit  accentuating and flattering my shape.   on my to get list.
I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short  even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!
Fabric is soft and comfy  color is true to photo. the arms are a little tight now and i haven't washed it yet so i am a bit worried but still a keeper.
Wonderful  slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit.
This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!
I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.
The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.
This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the "grey" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.
This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple  which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
Just a wonderful shirt -- fabric is so soft  it feels like pajamas  and the blue is just perfect. there's a different blue plaid as a lining  and i almost wish it was reversible. they're both great patterns! wonderful for fall...
A perfect summer dress! beautiful print and is extremely flattering for a curvy frame! i have worn this dress twice and have received at least 2 compliments each time! only note... wearing a bra with this dress isn't really a possibility due to the back detail. its pasties or if you're okay being "free flowing" & your chest isn't too large.. you can get away with it! ;)
I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made  then it would have been a winner!
I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!
I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can  but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y  which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps  making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size  it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!
There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1". don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price.
Great looking casual dress  but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice  clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small  i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size  i can't wait to wear this! warm weather  sandals and a tote for running errands!
I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on  the perfect length  beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6" and 125lb and the s was for me.
I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size  but is very short. i am 5'2" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.
Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!
Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave
After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo
I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual  white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!
Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.
The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.
I adore these pants! comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties. every time i wear them i am complimented on them!
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!
I am 5'4"  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event.
Definitely a curve hugger. i bought the summer version of this dress (sleeveless white with black stripes) earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long. was very excited to see a fall/winter version to pair with tights and boots. bought a medium again and it fits great. this is a very flattering dress  and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws.
This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan  but the quality and feel are better than usual.
I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material  but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.
I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton  making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6  i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area  making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a
I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.    i normally wear an 18  sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths  but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12  so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.    this dress fits in
Overall  it's a beautiful dress  and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price)  and as other reviewers have mentioned  it's just a tad too short. for reference  i'm 5'5  125 lbs and the 2 fit well  but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
Love this dress! light and breezy  but i'm wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look.
The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 12 top  or a l  but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits  and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that  it looks great  just runs small. if you are a size 14 or larger  i don't think that this will fit.
This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made  cozy  easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!
I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress  i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy  itchy polyester-like fabric  not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black  not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly  i am 5'8" and the dress is very short on me. it'
Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy  i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem  which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip
For starters  the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top  but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top  the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.
I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large  and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package  i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on  and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model  it will work for you. it is made of cupro  looks exactly like the photo  the color is g
This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green  not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband  which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy  elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks  i decided to remove the tie string  which hangs low; it
This dress is lovely. timeless style  heavy fabric  only con? a deep front v. i couldn't wear this to church. i'm a 36d.
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short  heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.
Love all pilcro  this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!
I'm 5'4" 120#   34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model.
Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short  i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs  chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.
I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively  causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model  this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will
This dress is very comfortable  lovely  and versatile. i know i will wear this often throughout the spring and summer months because of it's elegant ease. i purchased a small and am a 34c and 28 waist; fits perfectly.
I adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.
I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.
I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.
Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available  i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3" tall  140#  36dd  28" waist  35" hips  wide
Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from
I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think it's such a nice deal. i really like how this one is soft  well made  has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is. the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit. i didn't find this one too boxy for me as it's a topper after all. there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think it's a great piece to throw on w
I loved these shorts; however  they seemed to be doomed! i received these on july 2nd & wore them at for a party we had on july 3rd  with the top shown. the fit was true to size  style & quality were nice. during the day i first ripped them on a low arbor gate latch  then later they were splashed with red wine when my husband startled me & i threw my red wine in the air. typically  i am very careful and do no have an issue with ruining my clothes. he felt so bad he asked me to get a new pair. i
This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.
I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out
I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color  the quality  the style  but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work  but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun  but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely  and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.
I too  was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of
I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly  and was so soft. but when i washed it  following the instructions  it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage  at least.
I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick  high quality and a beautiful color.
First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a
This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although  you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price  i think it should come with a slip. fyi  the back half of the waist has elastic 
The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though  because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall  very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!
Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!  but as others have stated  the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.
I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said  i hand washed it  as the tag states  then let it line dry  and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states "dry clean recommended." boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.
I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors.     i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine  then line drying. i have done this for years with al
I'm typically a 27. this 27 seems snug but there isn't a 28 in petite so i'm keeping these 27 petites. i ordered 27 regular also and they are too long. i'm 5'4" 128lbs. they are very comfortable. hope they stretch just a tad.
Love the print and loose fit. doesn't look to wide on my top heavy torso and the sleeves don't cling to my chubby upper arms or tummy. wore all day today  first with shorts then with cropped jeans.
I'm 5'5" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs  34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too  but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering.
I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.
Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.
I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6"  petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy.
This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict  a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said  this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation  and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!
This sweater is comfy and light and the buttons are a great added detail. i bought this as a gift  but i tried it on anyways and almost kept it for myself! great for early spring days.
The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.
I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted  it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband  as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue  but the top stayed put.  overall  very pleased.
I'm not petite  but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places  the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.
This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.
I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.
Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom  the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!
I love this! i bought it in the red color. in person it is a deeper color than it looks online and it has some flecks of lighter yarn in it that just add to it's beauty. it is very soft and cozy. it is warm without being hot. i typically wear a small/sometimes medium at retailer. i bought a medium only because i wanted it to be a little longer so that i could wear it with leggings and feel comfortable. i am 5'8" though  so if you are shorter than you may not need to size up. it looks great with a
I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2"  115#.
Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands  but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely  with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.
I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit  which i would've been willing to work with  but... as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?
While the dress is pretty  it's a lot more boring than it seems online. the box top is actually a completely separate piece  which is kind of neat - you can choose to remove it or not. the box top is very wide (much wider than on the model) and very unflattering! also  the dress is a stiff silk fabric and doesn't flow like you would think it would. returning it!
I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like  but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt.
I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.
I love the overall look and comfort of this piece. my only negative is that since it is not lined  the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable  especially in the shoulder areas. i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me  but it is not something that would make me return it. it is comfortable and looks great on.
Like other reviewers noted  the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
I purchased the blue one - it's a very brilliant royal blue. nice color. the patterned portion is quite heavy  which provides a nice drape. hangs really well without being clingy or too loose. great top for jeans.
This looked like such a cute  casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said  it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on  i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a "swing" top. i am 5'9" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it  as shown  i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.
I'm 5.5"  128 lbs  34b cup  slender throughout  size 2 fit perfectly. lightweight  flattering dress. bought on sale to wear next year to baby/bridal shower type event.
I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny   high waisted version. first  i don't like the faux whiskering on the jeans  i think it makes them look cheap. second  the fabric had more stretch than i'm use to for pilcro denim  and made them feel low quality.  i don't think they are terrible  i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
Adorable skirt. the eyelet part on the bottom is cut-out so see through but cute and subtle. found it fit a little snug on me- could just be my build  but i ordered it in normal size and 1 size up. the size up fit best.
This is a beautiful dress. fits true to size. very flowy and comfortable. the color looks just like the pic.
Love tiny. i am 5'7"  125-128 lbs depending on the day  and a 34a. i also have a very long torso  and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one  however  was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated  so it looked boxy on me. however  the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo  and then
I am an retailer employee. i immediately fell in love with this dress. i tried it on and it was way to long  as always with regular store sizes...i am short 5'0". i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month  i ordered it anyway. my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size. i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there. i purchased a 2 petite which is the size i
This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small.
I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
This dress  like all byron lars dresses is a work of art. it has true quality of workmanship. and fits like a glove. i always get compliments when i wear any of his dresses and i have 5!. this one is somewhere between casual and dressy. perfect for a dinner out on a saturday night!. order a petite if you are under 5 5"
Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.
Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
This is such a beautiful top with pretty  vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine  the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back  with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!  so sad to have to return this one.
This is a really cute top. it's boxy but it's cotton eyelet so you shouldn't expect form fitting. if you are in between sizes order a size down. i'm a 36 ddd and usually have to wear large with retailer brands  however  the medium fit fine  it doesn't pull in the back or shoulders. the cotton material is thick enough that you don't have to wear a cami underneath if you don't want to. it's also long enough that your stomach won't show through the bottom eyelet band.
I normally wear a 4 or 6 at retailer and bought this in a 6. the size 6 is even a tad small in the bust area but not small enough to size to an 8. i am 32d for reference. for ladies larger than a c cup  i would recommend sizing to your larger size. definitely try on at the store if you can.
I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time  layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring  especially with that flower print.
Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it's comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.
Very flattering cut. only con is that is seems to snag easily. extremely comfortable and don;t need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would.
I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.
I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be "voluminous"--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel
Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable  effortless  and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large  but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.
This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality  but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big.     the fit is tts  though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.
I will find myself reaching for this top time and time again
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back  but front was just too clingy. back it goes.
I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f  so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new  fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer  and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w
These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually  if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).
This lounge robe is the most fantastic  dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3" 36dd and 140#.
I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white  but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy  but the rest of the top makes up for that.
I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!
I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!
This vest is very nice and fashionable  very stylish. i like it a lot. however  it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however  the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere  so i could not imaging wearing this vest  it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky!
This skirt is a real "dress up" piece. it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist. the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely. i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments
The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur
I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.
Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this  but where was quality control?
Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall  120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
This shirt fits well  is flattering  and has a really pretty pattern to it. the lace adds a romantic touch that sets it apart. it's also incredibly soft and comfortable.
L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place  but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.
I ordered this in the china pattern color  and the colors are vibrant and beautiful! the suit is well made and slimming. there are no bra cups; just a shelf bra  but the tie halter adds some extra support. i have trouble buying bathing suits  but i am very happy with this one.
I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend  well made too.
This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4  and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute  and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.
This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first  it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
This is such a lovely top. it is a bit sheer but i wear a cami under it. i wish it came in more colors because it is just so pretty!
I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress  even though i sized down.
Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
Based on the two reviews on this skirt and  for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle  and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping  slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping  but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.
I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!
So  this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made  flowey. very comfortable  until you have to take it off.  this is the review i posted on facebook.   so  no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror  or maybe has not shared with me  that moment when you cannot get out of  because it has turned into a straight jacket  that otherwise cute romper. and again  maybe a man invented it!
Thick  soft  awesome quality - what's not to love?! i've had an awful time finding a new black warm cardigan this year to throw over anything from a tee to a casual dress  and this finally fits the bill! while it is soft like a sweatshirt  i would definitely not say that this is purely loungewear. nice enough to replace my old ratty sweaterknit!
I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium  post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.  the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up.     also the length was super long  description says 35" which would be mid thigh for me  but this thing hit me mid knee. also  like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress  but the shoulders def
Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.
This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however  one i put it on  i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also  the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.
I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.
While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
I was hesitent to order this  was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9).
It lays very nicely on your body. very flattering!!!!
I love the lacey design of this top. however  it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better  but this size was too short. in addition  the lace didn't lay very flat  and there were lose threads all over. overall  not worth the price.
I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.    it is a very unique piece and high quality; however  i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes  and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i wouldn't want to size down...)
There were no reviews  it's an "online exclusive" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this  it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth
In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!
Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival  i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise  when the arms are extended  the sleeves do hav
I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside
Nice t-shirt. the print is very nice and the fabric is soft and flowing. i love the baseball cut  it gives it a different look.
I actually rather like this top  i ordered a size smaller than usual  based on how flowy it looks in the picture  and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich  and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it  and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot  but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material  so of course  it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also  there was no petite in the pink  so can't comment on
Comfortable jacket that your can cross your arms and your back is not stuck.  it is stretchy.
Upon opening this top  i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall  but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin  and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots  but i love this shirt. i got the xs  which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s  but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.
I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
It was a hard decision  but i'm returning these. they're definitely pretty and well-made. they drape nicely. ultimately  they are too high-waisted and too billowy for most of my tops (which are mostly long and billowy). these trousers are too nice to wear with most of my fitted tanks. even a normal-length t-shirt  untucked  draped weirdly and came down too far on these high-waisted pants. i guess they're too "formal" for what i had in mind - pictured them more like a maxi skirt. if they were hal
My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.
Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.
This is really a cute top  nice fabric  the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8"  36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking  especially in the front. it hit at hip level  as in photo  but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t
I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes  perfect for me.
You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy  going out look. in the picture it looks more casual  but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt  wearing it to work  or whatever. i tried it on and i thought "wow  i look thin." it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry  it's not a crop top  but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips  probably mid-rise)  but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba
I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on  and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger  but  in fact  it's a very surprising find  as others have mentioned. _____________ pros: - a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit. - the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this. - lots of stretch and very  very comfortable. i can see myself wearing
Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased
I love this unique t-shirt. the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots. a western look that's feminine. the shirt is very soft  ordered my usual size small  a little long but good for tucking in.
Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops. i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans.
The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug
I'm usually a petite  but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better  but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2" and 105 lbs  but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry  it's a return for me.
I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8  125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them  they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you  retailer  for always helping me find great jeans!
This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  "i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful
I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful  but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single  good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.
I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
Like most of the other reviewers  i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round  too.
This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears  several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews  i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy  cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly  but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it's completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.
This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush  and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well  just above the knee.
Likes: colors  the design of the flower is very pretty  the color-blocking is a nice touch and in this season  but  it is pretty short.  i bought thh petite right off the bat as i assumed i would need that  but i really dind't. it ended up beign too short.  #/4 sleeves always flattering  but hte cut is meant to be comfy  i think it would have looked better on me if it was a little more hourglass hsaped (if that makes sense#.  i am usually xs  and that was fine  so buy your usual size ok #one siz
These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me.
I love this  despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks  jeans and shirts. it is soft  feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous "dress it up or dress it
I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.
I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess  i want to buy two more just in case!
I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully  the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also  there were a lot of thread h
As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou
I am 5'6" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft  and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top.
I really wanted to like these. they're soft  long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(
I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
Dress is lovely - the sleeves were shorter than i thought but otherwise nice fabric and very pretty cut!!
I received this in the mail a few days ago  and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!
This top is so pretty! i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special. it's true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style. i didn't find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line (i'm 5'10"). i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly! i know this will be one piece i wear quite often!
This does run big but because it is cotton  it easily shrinks in the dryer. i love it! i do wish the color was more saturated/deeper.
This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale  and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!
I bought the white in my usual xs size  i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin  because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric   not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.
I was excited to receive this top because i love the design  but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.
I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
Lovely! at 5'6"  34a-28/29-36  the size small was a great fit. moss color is really quite grey. drapes beautifully and is an easy wear.
I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up
The jacket is great  the quality is very good and the fit too  the best part is how it looks !
I am sadly returning this dress  but i would recommend it! it is soft and i loved the design of the dress. very comfortable. the only reason i am returning it is due to my figure. it is a fitted dress and was a little more revealing that i would have liked.
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
I purchased this dress in the green  and while the print and material were lovely  the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft  36d and 29" waist and the size 2 fit  which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress.
I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate  it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t  and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.
I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable  classic  good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!    it is a bit loose in the middle  but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p
The embroidery on the side is cute  and they're nice and airy for hot days. however  the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also  they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.
I bought this top and it ran huge  i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad  i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.
This skirt is a perfect statement piece that will work fancy cocktails and social events. it is a full skirt but not too overwhelming. perfect with a slim fitting black bodysuit. i sized up a bit and ordered an 8. waist fits well and length works with slight heel. quality is great. design is beautiful without being too much.
I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos  maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea
This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.
I like the colors  material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6" size 8.
I am going to keep it. i think it will be a great "throw on and go" piece you can wear with many different types of shoe/sandal. the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut. two complaints: runs a little big on bottom  a little "genie" looking...like there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles. but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight  to the point i thought i was going to rip it
According to the label  this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label  and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.
This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4  120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater didn't feel too scratchy but it's not a soft sweater. very feminine.
I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3"  +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics  so that may vary a bit. however  the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash  but sometimes that's worth it.
This is a very pretty dress. the previous reviewers helped a lot when it came to deciding which size to order. typically i am a 0 or 2  sometimes a 4. in this dress i ordered a 6. that was the perfect size.     the coloring is cute  unique  and very versatile. for me it wasn't a keeper because the material was soooo heavy  feels like canvas almost. if you're looking for a dress to layer under a chunky sweater on a cold day i imagine this would work. but for me it was a no.
I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer.     i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it.
Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional  it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6" 122# and went with the xs
I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.
This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy  but even so  i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.
This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.
I was looking for a basic tee  but this one was just ok...the quality is okay  but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately   i will be returning this item.
This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.
This top had potential  but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"  135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy  but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves  but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute  but thi
Maternity like  and although the back is really cool  there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.
Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front  so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!
This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4" about 130lbs  athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well.
This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse  which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.
I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too  you won't be disappointed with this one.
I think of tracy reese as running small  and usually size up  but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage  so you need the right bra.
I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
I bought this dress in a medium petite. i'm 5'2 and 140#. it fit great and made my waist look really tiny. i cannot wait the dress with heels or else you would see the entire shoe. it works perfect with flat sandals. i've received tons of compliments! you can also wear a normal bra with the dress. love it!
This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out! the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs. i'm going to enjoy wearing this with jeans - it looks great with gray or black denim. the colors are fabulous for someone with "spring" coloring - the front panel is a very pale peach / peche. i'm 5'4"  128lbs  with small shoulders and 32c chest  i'm typically a size 2-4 or size xs-s  and ordered an xs. it fits well  a little tighter than on the model -
When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust  and the peplum just made me look like i didn't have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top  but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures.
I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique  a "mossy" fuzzy print  and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but  if you do not wear a turtleneck under it  you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!
This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.
Love this romper! it is beautifully made and classy. the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid. i'm 5'5" and 135 and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so. can't wait to where it.
I love birds
Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.
I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress  the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me  and they
I love this dress  but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small  but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on  but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work.
The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch. i layer it with various camis for a different look each time. i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade  and goes well with so other many colors. looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect. classic yet unique! runs very true to size.
I've been shopping at retailer since 2007  and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.   1. it is long on her  not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance.  2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above.  3. in the picture  t
I love  love  love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
This dress does run a tad small. for me it was small across the chest and i did have to shimmy into it. i am 5'6"  110 and got size s. if i had gotten the m it would have looked a tad frumpy (on me). pretty  but wasn't happy with the fit aside from that the "line"separating the top from the bottom was rather high for me and it seems that it was not really intended to be an "umpire" waist. i tried a belt with it and at my natural waist left the line uncovered several inches up toward my chest. i
I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit  to the colors and pattern  to the design  and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion  a great price for a versatile  high quality dress. the material is that super comfy  stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a
The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.   sending back
I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.
I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted  but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through.     fit is tts.
I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8  ordered a 10 and it was snug
I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging  and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference  i am 5'5"  135  34c and a small was perfect.
This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big  loose and had no shape at all.
This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.     very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.
I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors  so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise  nice shorts for the price.
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice  very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch  105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking  but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women  but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful "vintage-made-modern" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t
I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
Not sure why this dress was once backordered? if you have a big chested basically falls from your chest straight down and gives you know figure. disappointing. i will be returning it. not meant for big chested fit woman.
What a delight of a dress! i saw it online and it piqued my interest in person too. with only one size available  i was limited to try on a dress two sizes too small  so i've factored that in to my review. the dress is very light and would be see through without the attached slip. the length fell just above my ankle with the design allowing for a movement and flow to the bottom. the colors are vibrant in person  perhaps even more so than online. the fit seems to be true to size  though i have to
This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion  it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.
I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
These are cool jeans to have in a mound of typical denim jeans i have in my closet and these are like a thorwback of the 60s/70s made with modern  high quality denim. this is my first pair of 7 for all mankind denim  so i can't reference how they fit to their other jeans. however  based on typical pants sizing with other brands at retailer  these pants do run smaller than other brands  especially in the waist area. i ended up buying my size but clearly a diet will be in my near future because they
I ordered a m/l in this vest and it fits perfectly. thirst is cozy and stylish. in fact  i ordered the same vest in another color! it's versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans. i also think it's a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come.
Love this top! made with 100% cotton  a vintage look  and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3"). it is somewhat see through  but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work  i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight  comfortable  standout piece for the summer time :)
Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.
I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however  the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus  it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.
I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both. the fabric is soft  not too substantial but still warm for my climate  goes great with many outfit combinations  has a flexible cut for my body type. i chose to to buy the size small and while it's a little tight in the upper sleeves (because my upper arms are chubby) i can work with it when i wear the right top. the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the
I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline  i think  creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that  the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back  especially at the sale price.
I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly  these will be going back.
The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
I wanted to love this. the fabric and design are very nice. unfortunately - on my petite frame it looked like a lampshade. this would be very pretty on taller girls. for reference  i am 5'3 117 34b.
I like the style  but i ordered an extra small (i am5'4' 120#) and it was still too loose fitting on me  had to return  hopefully exchange for xxs
I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!
I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just
This is a shift dress  which is a great dress for many people  in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that  i mean  a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes  good legs  a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however  when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves  you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck  just a bit lower than this  because it makes
First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich  deep  gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.
I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am  this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets
I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
Yes  it's a swing top  just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me  being top heavy  so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge  with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top  which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.
I'm 5'8  130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.
I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10" and 145 pounds  and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures  at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh  as shown  and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though  i decided to return the dress  because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati
This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye?   i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.
Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn't as real  almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why  pilcro?? the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the
A $200 piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model. avoid ! mine went back the same day it came in the mail...
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!
Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail
When this piece arrived  i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it  an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together  the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home  i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag  and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually  i like the look of a dress that
Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!
I was excited to get this shirt in the mail  i liked the pattern a lot  but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"  130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric  the shirt pulled open in the chest area  making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric  especially since she's small on top. ther
This shirt is very swingy but true to size. when i tried to size down the shoulders were too tight. the green color has great texture.
I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great  the fit was great  but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.
I love the colors on this dress  very nice on a pale skin. i ahd this in my wish list for so long  and it finally went on sale. i ordered it and was very pleased. only drawback is the collar was a little irritating (but i am ok with it). it fits like a glove (o)  i didn't think it would as there are no petites  but that worked for me  the lace pattern is classy. and the hem is totally fun. great purchase (maybe petite would not have bothered my neck).  115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist
This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6" and the length is a liittle low
I haven't owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details  the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i'm 5'5" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room.     i'm wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top  white/navy striped vans  and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i'm looking f
This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.
The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern  but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s  and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey  and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference  i'm 5'4"  120 lbs).
I am 5'-7" and 135 lbs  i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees  instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length...
Just received these and they fit perfectly  but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise  but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
Very comfortable. runs a little large. purchased a medium and probably should have gone with a small.
I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color  i am 5'4"  100lbs  petite frame  and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick  drapes well  not too tight  and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect  no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion  can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase  100% recommend.
This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me  i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8" and a size medium or 10.
They have all the features i've been searching for: the leg is straight  not tapered or fitted. the fabric is soft  with an authentic worn-in look. the overall look is casual  relaxed and cool. i love these chinos and definitely plan to buy more.
Love the style  fabric and fit generally  but even ordering down a size  i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size  but not sure it will work as much as i want it to.
Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.
This is the perfect dress! for summer  fall  winter or spring  it is flattering and looks cute with booties  flip flops  brogues or barefoot! runs a teeny bit large - i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect! i might just buy the other color it comes in!!!!
This top is fun. loose but still flattering. the colors are nice and the fabric soft. can fit well. (115lbs 30 dd)
The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b  150 5' 9"  tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.
Gorgeous and well constructed dress. runs a little small. couldn't button up the size 8 although i can fit into a size 6 of other dresses by this designer. also the back buttons are very difficult to button  especially by yourself. i had to return it but am contemplating ordering it in a size 10.
Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length wouldn't be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique  by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and  subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.
I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft  comfortable  and cute! unfortunately  it runs to short.  i am 5'8" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn't work.
I finally tried this on now that it went on sale  and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color  and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great  long but ok for me 
...the print is so sharking  and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure  and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve  but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.
I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work  but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.
This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?
Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise  my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red  and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!
This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small  sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25" long instead of the 35" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two.
This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.
Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.
This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing  mailing it back.
These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. "one size" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.
I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured  but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette  but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally  the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses  but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful  and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of
This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.
I'm 5'8" and a 2/xs and this fit well in size 2  waist was actually a bit loose. unfortunately the waist hit at least 2" too high -- on my ribcage. not cute or flattering. that was the only flaw. would be perfect on someone about 5'6". otherwise the dress looked exactly as pictured. love the boho vibe of this dress  the lace  sleeve length  and cotton material. could easily be dressed up or down. the style feels a little edgy - not too sweet. i am so sad to return this.
I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.
This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.
I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?
I love this top. so much so that i bought it in black and red. i do think it runs a bit big. i normally wear a medium or small. i bought this in extra small and it fits beautifully. can be dressed up or dressed down. love that it is a double layered knit too. the fabric is soft and drappy. this is a staple top. looks great with a pencil skirt tucked in. got lots of compliments when i wore the red one. havent worn the black one yet. for reference im 5'9"   weigh 125lbs and wear a 34b.
I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil
I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'4 with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.
I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan  and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.
I've been looking for a great long  loose  versatile vest for some time  and this is just about perfect. it's slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate)  but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger  and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!
Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on  which i love. the floral pattern is delicate and subtle  and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce. it is so versatile! the quality is excellent. the skirt is fully lined. it will take me easily through three seasons (the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer). i'm so happy i bought this!
Beautiful delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print  very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless  i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.
Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape  very flattering. however  the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...
The pattern and colors are very pretty  and the material is soft and silky. i returned it  though  because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts  which is not going to work for me.
I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.
These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans  without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference  i am 5'2"  108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle.
Love this jacket - got it in the charcoal color. i especially enjoy the collar and the handy pockets.
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
As part of the over 60 crowd  i rarely wear dresses any more - but this called out to me.. and it didn't disappoint! i ordered the plum - true to size and and color. i usually wear a medium and it fit perfectly. i liked the previous review suggestion and i will also wear this with boots and t-shirt to get more use out of it as well as dressing up.it's a real keeper.
Not great quality  runs a bit lose  disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)
I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral  just beautiful!
When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it  upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places  the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!
This dress is beautiful  it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous  just not a good fit for me  even at a 0p.
I thought i would need a medium in this top  but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well  much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"  140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots.
This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf  and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish"  118#  34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre
I love everything about this dress. the coloring  fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.
I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it  so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because  yes  this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.    the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long  you end up clingi
I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however  the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.
I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw
I am 5 8"  130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely  it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!
I love this dress .  perfect fit and very good quality.
This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.    wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.
I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror  it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however  that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself  but at 48  i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!
This top is gorgeous!!! the picture just does not do it justice. i bought it solely based on the one review that said it looks very good. and it does! the velvet work at the top makes it look very dressy. the sleeves are not with big holes that show too much  the top and sleeves are perfect. i really like this top. i can't believe that the photo doesn't show it's gorgeousness  it looks so much better in-person. i so wish it came in more colors!!
The color was very different and vibrant. chose to size up for extra room and length
I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.
Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric  and has perfect fit  nice arm length  looks good on the hanger  the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded  in the mail  so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket  tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put
Comfy and different. almost like a sweater fabric.
Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26  so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8 
Super cute and flattering!
This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!
This is such a cute sweater! i wouldn't really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves. it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering. i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white.... red  black  or navy would have been perfect!
I can't wear this without getting dozens of compliments. plus  it's comfortable! it's very soft. it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots  with pants  or with skirts. i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. everyone wants to know where i got it! it's very well made and the embroidery is well done. it doesn't look like it is going to come undone anytime soon.
This top is lovely  but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.
I've purchased these in the past and found that they wear well  so i came back for some new colors this year. i ordered blue  holly (a deep olive-y green)  and grey to try  and found that they all fit slightly different. the navy fit me perfectly in a size 27 (i'm 5'4"  120 lbs)  but the holly cords were tight in the legs  and i couldn't button the top. the grey was somewhere in between. i also felt like the grey showed more lumps and bumps. the navy is super flattering.
Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.
This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.
Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one
Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine  however  because of size and price.
The fringe and fit were beautiful  but the lace with it (a little hard to see in the photo) seemed like an odd pairing -- just too much going on. returning . . . .
Such a gorgeous top  the detail and fit are amazing. however  after wearing the top for about 8 hours  7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but  i love the top so much  i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.
I am petite with somewhat broad shoulders. iusually wear 2 or 2p dresses. i ordered a 2 and it was tight in the shoulders & hip. otherwise this is a cute dress  looks better on the person than in pictures. the tie is an interesting twist on an otherwse basic shirtdress. the fabric drapes nicely on the body  i reordered dress in a 4. inever wear size4. hopefully it's not too big or long.
It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.
Order a whole size down and this may work. i'm normally a 6-8 or a medium but this was huge. ordered the small because i loved the color/design. hopeful!
This is a nice year round weight sweater.   i am thrilled with small details  true to retailer pieces.
This top is my favorite of the season! planning to order in black too.
This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however  it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly  this is a deal breaker for me.
I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them. they are my new favorites. i like them so much i am buying another pair. i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way. slimming as well.
The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
This is my fourth amadi piece from retailer.  i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces (like the lola jumpsuit  crossfront lola dress and others).  this dress has the same crossover top design  with a slim maxi silhouette.    the fabric is 97% rayon and 3% nylon with a neat texture that doesn't come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles.  it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie
Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.
I'm normally a size small  but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.  the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.
I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.
I love the black and pale pink of this dress  the contrasting fabrics and the embroidery. my favorite kind of dress  creative and a little edgy  but elegant and can be dressed for the office too. ordered a size up from my usual size because i tried the previous dress in this style and it was a bit snug. the size up was a good decision  fits in the shoulders and waist better. the fabrics are nice and the finishing on the dress is well done. the mesh in the bodice is a little delicate and i will h
I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism  it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful.
I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin. the shimmer is very subtle  but there  the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt  but it is more "sophisticated" in person. very soft fabric  fitted on the "wasit"  but romier on top  cowl is super flattering. usual sizze fit very nicely. highly recommend  i won't hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it :-# i think it can be dressed up #skirt# or down #jeans#  almost a basic t!
I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.
I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.
I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!
Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange  so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!
....but not for me. i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in  but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs. right out of the bag  i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper. however  i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on. from the pictures  it looks like there is a small opening  but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back. this may not be the same for a taller person s
I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however  in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt  at least on me. it was oddly shapeless  even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c
I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller  it would work for you.
Upon entering a local retailer store  i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on.   fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist  5'3" (almost)  and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted  button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one  but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be "loose-fitting". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12  but it was too big in the armholes and chest  causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10  these
This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.
The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.
Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.
The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.
Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top  falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5"6'). classic  elegant  femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions.
But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.
I love this tunic  super flattering + long enough (if your no super tall like me) to wear with leggings! it does run a little big  i like tops a little looser on me so i didn't mind that. i ordered a small- if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down.     i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!    thanks retailer for being awesome!
These relaxed fit jeans are super soft. they do run a size large  i am a size 26 in the stilt style and the 25 in these fit well with a little "room".
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.
This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust  order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.
This dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape.
This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9  a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
Cut out design  no seems or hems.   very disappointed in retailer
I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does  so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider  especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
I purchased another top  same brand  in the same style from retailer and really love it. the fabric is lightweight  which makes it great for multiple seasons. i travel extensively and these tops hand wash and hang to dry very nicely. i wear a gray tank under this one and love the look. i also like the long length. as usual  i will probably tack the neckline up an inch or so  so that it's not so low - just my thing. overall  the pattern and the fabric are very nice. i usually wear an xs or s; i pur
I love this! i agree with previous post that say  it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it's a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.
I love the top for its minimal fuss - no ironing  yay! definitely go 1 size smaller than your regular size. i got my usual small size but was swimming in it at the waist. the pattern and material are great! i bought the navy blue and might also get the yellow. i would have liked it to be slightly longer  since i have a curvy bottom. i am 140lbs and got the small.
My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much. perfect tunic length  swingy  detailed...but as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it. i just got it and im in love! the orange print is so lovely. the perfect fall color and the print is timeless. the fabric is light and easy. the fit is definitely bigger  but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl. i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room  but i needed the xl for room i
This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs  ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering  and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
Cute shorts with great fabric (and lined so they lay smooth over your body). i really love that the material has a dressier feel  but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me (curvy body  5'7''  150). i'm returning them and trying a small. elastic waist is great for me after having a baby  but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt.
This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair  i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor)  but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you  nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown  but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w
The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops  but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly  but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price  it is worth tailoring.
I got this dress in the mail  and while i loved the concept of it  it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist  it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting  and to me  made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good  but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot  but it would have still been a shapeless dress  just bigger. it does fit true to size 
This is a nice dress  but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .
This looked fabulous on the model  of course  and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs  i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
This dress has potential  but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big  i ordered medium  my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9"). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit 
I'm 5'7 and 137 pounds and i tried on this dress in the store. i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove. this dress is great quality and feels good  looks good and can be dressed up or down. like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress. high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day. go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars. one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath
I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult  but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.
I bought this to wear to work  but i pictured it as being fancier than it is. the fabric is heavy  stiff sweatshirt material. i bought a small but probably would have been better off with an xs. despite this  it's long enough to be a dress on me  and it is comfortable and cute. it will be nice in the winter and could probably be dressed up some.
Love  love  love this dress. you can dress it up with high heels  or down with sandals . a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining . i am athletic   5' 7" and 132 lbs and bought a size small. i have broad shoulders   average waist   short torso   small hips and long legs. in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress.
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.
I am 5' 7" with an athletic build (small chest  small waist  muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small  an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.
I purchased these pants in blue  they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.
I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color  but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up  right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.
Even on sale  this was just too pricey for what it is  which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps  but it hangs very wide off your chest.
I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!
Love this! it's loose and easy for summer  fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.
This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
Based on reviews  i got the medium pink size: 8 petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap. i'm 5'6" and 32d. i figured the 8 petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter. it was too big and even though it was petite  still too long. wanted to like it  but at full price  decided to return.
I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find  that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull  it was really large in the body. in addition  while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.
First of all  mine arrived in a regular denim shade  not the dark wash shown. also  the style is more like a blazer  and it was huge. i am 5'2" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well  the sleeves came barely past my wrists  they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person  if you can.
This is a nice top! it is dressy and cute  tts. i am 8 or 10 and got a med. would look great with jeans  pencil skirts  slim cut pants. very happy with this purchase.
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.
Love that this is comfy  with a subtle yet sexy vibe. had so many compliments when i wore this to work  with everyone asking where i got it! fits true to size (110lb  5'4") and xs fit perfect. took off a star because it may look like it could get that "fuzzy" pilling over time.
This is a richly detailed top that i bought to go with some nice skirts. the length hits right at the waist so it won't overlap a special skirt at the waist and create extra bulk. it is lined with a flesh colored mesh layer in the white color (you can see this layer in the photos but i wasn't sure if it was part of the piece or a camisole the model was wearing). however  it is still somewhat transparent so you would want to wear it with a flesh-colored bra or cami. overall  i am very happy with
I purchased this top in the store  intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy  and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front  it looks pretty traditional  but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large  though  as i purchased an xs and still h
As other reviewers have pointed out  the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad  i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.
I am a pilcro hyphen girl  and now i have these pants to love as well  super comfy and cute  the print is nice and subtle. i'm usually a 29p but the 29 regular is fine.
I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.
I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it  except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you  you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on  feel comfy  and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.
I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.
This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine  comfortable  and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!
Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference  i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs  it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant!
I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper.  i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item.
I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's 2 layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an
The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.
I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height   weight  and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu
I ordered these in eptites  tey were a ltitle long still. also a tiny bit on the loose side. i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost  so wil lwait for hte sale. color combination was nice though a dn the cut relatively flattering  i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price. nice business/casual pant.
This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front  which fit nicely  but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps  i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!
I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?
I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim.
This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this.
Warm  cozy  can dress down/up  and is perfect for traveling. a great staple. as other people noted  the dress (if you buy your regular size) is a little more fitted than it looks on the model. size up if you prefer it to hang looser.
I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great  but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.
So soft and comfortable!
If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.
This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front  and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice.
I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern  so hopefully will work for others!
This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.
Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.
Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material isn't that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.
There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs  the fabric isn't very soft  and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted  but i wasn't too fond of the dress.
The fabric was a beautiful color  but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.
This blouse is made out of a high-quality material  flows beautifully  and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference  size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.
I was so excited for this dress to arrive  but when it did  it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also  the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful  but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back
Love this top! the color is very pretty  great for the holidays. i haven't washed it yet  but it says machine wash which is a plus for me.
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
This dress is beautiful. however  it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress  which is not pictured. the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream. i sized up bc i didn't want it to be too fitted  i'm between a 6 snd 8 so i went w medium. it fits will but slightly big. i'd say tts though.
I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
This vest is sooo cute!  i bought the red (really a dark burgundy) and it is perfect for fall.  i wanted to buy the other color but it's sold out online.  i'm 5'3" and the length is fine.  i'm usually an xs 2 or 4 at retailer and the regular xs/s is the perfect size.  i am on the busty side and doesn't make me feel too heavy like some vests.
I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.
Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.
Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly don't know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means  like linen it does give with wear  so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you won't see your straps and i would dryel this  no washing of any kind  linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up.
I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again. the dress is very comfortable and looks polished. i wore this dress for 12 hours and did not want to take it off. the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done. i am 5'5 and the dress hit me 2 inches above my knee. i highly recommend this dress  i received so many compliments.
The snake and the studs  they make the dress. sadly  the snake is hard to find  as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large  i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small  fitted look  and the other two show a full  swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it's not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt)  the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather  the color is just right (not too light)  the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70's realness  sits higher on your waist  and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o
I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
I am 5'8" and 130 lbs and bought a size s. it fits  but is not as roomy as it appears in the model and the sleeves are not as long. the collar fits strangely on me. the deal breaker was that the sweater is not soft  but is itchy and kind of coarse. i am returning this one.
The pattern is cute and vibrant  and the shillouette is simple  but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
The dress didn't meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made  it just wasn't right for me.
Gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed
Really pretty. not very itchy and a great sweater to dress up or down.
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however  the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??
I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.
I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale  and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up  the arms do run a little tight. overall  the mock neck  button closure on the back  and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look
I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.
Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans
This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.
Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3" high heels. i am5 '3"  and probably would have been  better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however  busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt  w
I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference  i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.
Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone
I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
This is a beautiful spring/summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill-fitting sack.
I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
Other than the color (i got the rose color)  which is great  i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7" and the sleeves come right to my wrists  if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.
Ref: 5'4"  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.
I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately  this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big  it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump  but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans  linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too.   i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft  but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall  thin  without much figure. it's not cheap  but something i'll likely keep for a few years.
In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th
I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow)  but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2  and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!
Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size  and i love the fir  it si very feminine and flattering. i will have to go back for it. both apttenrs are really nice  and it also comes in balck in my store.  neckline is super flattering.
I loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house  so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store. i anticipated that i would need a large  but i was wrong. the m fits perfectly!   fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 in button-up or fitted tops and dresses (usually 10) and a m in a loose-fit or knit top.  the m fits me just like the model in the photo  so i would think that you are between sizes like i usually am  you should size down. the z
I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother 
This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r
I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab  yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons  yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands  yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits  so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits
I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!
This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however  only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say  i'm returning it.
This dress is really beautiful  but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low  i could wear a bra with straps with it  the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.
I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however  two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.
This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too  but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!
I loved this top . it is beautiful.
I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.
I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it  but in a good way.  shorter  sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look  you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo  the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees.
I ordered this after falling in love with the near-identically-patterned red linen shirtdress - this dress has almost exactly the same construction  but the cloth is slightly heavier-weight  and there is no slip (because the fabric is thick enough to not need one). a few other reviewers mentioned that the cut was ill-fitting or unflattering - obviously  that depends on the wearer's build - this dress seems cut for relatively small-busted people  so i lucked out. i love the classic a-frame outlin
I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however  like the other reviewer  when i tried it on  the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
Gorgeous color and fit  but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!!
This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me  but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp  and sized up for the arms. ove
Great summer skirt  can be dressed up or down. the band top is weird  but you don't have to style it as pictured. i may get the top hemmed down the road.    i have a 32 waist and got a size large.
I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester  and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
I ordered this in black and red. i had high hopes based on the reviews this received  but it's just ok. i will be returning.
I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14  and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!
The fabric was more "southwestern" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.
I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of
Size up i was surprised that the fit was small i always seem to wear a 6 in retailer pencil skirts this was tight!
I bought this dress online after a long search for the perfect dress to wear to my daughter's fall wedding. i did not want something full length or too formal. after modeling several dresses for my boys this one got the thumbs up. i do love the design and that it is different enough from all the other mother-of-bride dresses out there. i will wear this with black nylons and wedges (since this wedding is in a meadow). i'm completely satisfied! for reference i am 45 years old  5'10"  160 lbs with
Really like the loose flowiness. runs big went from med to small with better results. style is forgiving
After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
It really is a beautiful sweater.  the material is super soft and feels luxurious.  unfortunately  it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width.  maybe if i were taller  i could pull it off.
This is my second pair of these jeans (i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement). wear them all the time. i did go up one size to get a better fit (i don't exactly have slim thighs--ha!)  but other than that  they are pretty perfect!
I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
I love love this top and bought it in both colors. it runs a tad big but fits me well. both l and xl fit me well  but the xl was longer so i have one in each size. i really like this top. it looks good  goes well with most pants especially blue  and is very comfortable. i am very happy with my purchase.
This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
This is such a beautiful top  so flattering  soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue  a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color.
This top is so cute and of spectacular quality  but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute  so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.
I really like the style of this top  the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small  but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.
This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly  the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile.
While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.
I purchased this dress in the blue version. its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer. the dress fit tts on me .. it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area. i am on the fence about keeping it. the skirt is flouncy  cute and fun. i hope i can get it to work
In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7"  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this.
I ordered this coat in the "pink" color. actually  it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray  black  khaki  and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online  no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets  for anyone who remembers them)  one concern: since the wool is light
This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.
I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person  it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois ("shammy" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik
Nice sweater. i love the detail in the front. i didn't like that it was lined... it seemed too much like a jacket instead of a sweater to me. nice details on the sleeve but the sleeves are a bit long. i have found many retailer cardigans to be a bit on the small side so i sized up with this sweater.  no need to do that. this sweater is true to size.  i am usually a large and i felt the xl was too big. it fit like a jacket instead of a sweater. the sleeves are too long for my liking (i like 3/4 sle
I love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i don't want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants
As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
These are not only comfortable  but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else  and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual  beautiful beach pants. i got a small  my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"  130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts  bathing tops  coobies  any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.
Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer  but with a nude bra you can't tell at all)  so it's great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape  and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could've possibly gone with a 0  but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove
I bought these in white (not a harsh white  more soft-looking)  and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer's sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size)  which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5" tall  weigh 135 pounds  and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized  so there's some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels  they're perfect. they look as pictured  but what you can't tell from the photo i
I bought this is the orange/red motif and it is a beautiful print  although in person it is a more rich reddish color than the washed out model image. the entire shirt is sheer  so i will need to wear something under  but that doesn't bother me. i have a small chest (34a) and find that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back  but that wouldn't be an issue if i was a little better endowed. this looks gorgeous with black pants and a blazer. not sure that it is worth full price  b
The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge  it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale  i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.
I really liked the fabric and look of this top  but i was swimming in fabric.  there was so much that the top felt heavy.  i returned it.
Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale  and it was a good buy. i am 5'8" and purchased the size m  as i am a pretty true size 6.
The material of the dress is gorgeous  but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition  i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow  exposing your "chicken wings" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model  so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot!
I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer  but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine  but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing  but overall  just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material  not denim.
The colors are beautiful
I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
This blouse is stunning. i have been wanting it for some time. i finally broke down and purchased it. i am 5' 8" and about 160lbs. i generally wear size l /size 10. i bought this in a large. i need a medium for sure. i could get away with the large  but it's very flowy. i think the med will be more flattering. i am planning to exchange for a smaller size. i would recommend this blouse for sure. if you want it  buy it. it's often times sold out.
Love this top! kept looking online  but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store  i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1"  but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit  tts. love the colors in the pink top!
I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however  there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!
I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable. i'm 5'1"   107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer
Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.
I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple  chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality  the dress was 100% see-through  very thin  and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk  i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality)  but after trying it on i was really disappoin
I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person  and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile  and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly  the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the
Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small  didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine  has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
I ordered this and didn't even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just wasn't what i was looking for as far as color. also  the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well  thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a
The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.
This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire)  which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge  as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras  but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!
As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.
I ordered the navy  which is really stunning  by the way-and the cream. i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them! there you have it. that should say it all! it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which  if i'm not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you. the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue. as i said  my husband saw the cream colo
Read other reviews  was worried about neckline being tight-- went with size of last dress i bought from retailer ---s---  perfect!! can't wait to wear this dress! got it in the black white polka dot-- plan to layer with capri legging!
Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
I purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it's a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them
I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price  it really should be cut better.
I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before  so i ordered it in a 4p  my usual size  and a 4. i am petite  but the 4 worked perfectly  i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.    the quality is excellent  the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.
Great shirt  more of a stretch to it than i thought it would. very flowy  looks great with jeans & leggings.
Dolan is my go to for comfy  pretty  practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color  but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t
Great little dress for a picnic. i am a 34dd and didn't have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer. i had purchased a size 8. my only reason for return was the price and my wallet! otherwise this well-made dress would still be in my closet! love the buttons.
Just received pants and even though they are labeled "petite" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26  which is not what the description states.
This shirt runs extremely large. looks boxy and unflattering.
Love  love  love this silk dress. i feel classic retailer is back! perfect for hot and steamy summer days.  .  just a few photos of the back  which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops  grecian style. for some reason  in the online back photo  the model is wearing the dress backwards.   .  i'm 5'2"  currently 33-25-37 or 38 hips  narrow shoulders and torso  bra size 28dd/30d/32c. i tried on the size 2 regular which is the only one i found in the s
The color is a very soft peach  and the knit top over the gauze is a very light  summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual  or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
I wanted to love this dress. sadly  the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats didn't help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted.
I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw
I like this sweater  but it was like others i owned so i returned it. it is good quality and fits well.
The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.
I love the fabric of this shirt and particularly the blousy back. it is slightly boxy on me and i wish it was just a little longer. looks really cute under cardigans.
This looks cute on the model but was way too big  loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs  but returned it. it is an okay black top  nothing great.
On me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu. it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming. i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier  no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try  just not for me...    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back
This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
The double seams down the front of this elongate; the material is light and would work spring through summer  kind shape. even though the dress hits below the knee  the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly. here's the but:  the rib cage area is very fitted. i'm a 6-8  in pretty good shape  and that is not a "problem area" for me. however  in this dress  it was. there was no way for my figure to pull it off. from behind  in both 6 and 8  every bundle of skin seemed ample. i
Just didnt like the fit. it "puffed out" in front  so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape  and this was not a good fit for me.
Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"  114#  34b
I own this tank in three different colors  and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft  good quality  and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase  and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on  just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.
I ordered these pants in black and green. the fit of the pants is perfection. they feel amazing and are so flattering. they do run a full size small. i'm consistently a size 6 in all pants (typically wear paige  joes  and frame and always a 6) but i had to get these in an 8. the 8's feel great though so i think they're just a full size small.     secondly  the green color is not at all what's pictured. the green is hunter  not olive  and much less versatile. i'll be returning the green pants.
I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per
This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses  but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down  but i think it's too pretty not to keep.
Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for
I absolutely love this piece. it's a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion
Hi quality fabric and detail. fit really well. i'm 5.4  120 and they will be a staple of my summer wardrobe.
I got the sweater in red  (i'd call it more orange). it's a bit of a baggy fit  not tight which i love. i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings. i got a medium. i go between small and medium and i love the fit. i could have gotten a small  but i liked it looser  the buttons are special too.
There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...
I am 5'2" and 125 pounds and wear a 4p. i ordered the size 4 with the willingness to hem them; my goal was to get this true high-wasted style  which is extremely flattering. when the pants arrived  i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring. the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully. the true high waist flatters  but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist. i am so happy with my purchase!
The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope  it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done  i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful.     the cut is great  it doesn't show too much of the armpit  the straps and sides cover a normal bra  and the neckline just shows the collarbones.    the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t
This blouse is stunning on the website ;however  it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.
I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail. i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater. i feel the sizing is true-to-size but the design is not meant to be close to the body. for me  the shoulders and length were perfect.    this top is all about the sleeves. matador? perhaps  but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater. i will wear with with a vest  skinny jeans and booties.
I love my blue dress  i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight  not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes)  but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though  because it's a pretty shirt and different.
I wanted this so badly  to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am  and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person  i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1  which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings  and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin  i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26" (so it is at least 2" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!
My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.
I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall  i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...
Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i didn't really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just wasn't "fancy" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on.
Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big  the xxs are sold out. typical.
As other reviews stated  this dress runs very large. it was a big potatoe sack on me. added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos  it is going back!
When i tried it on  it was a bit shapeless  but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag  always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam  and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me. :-(
Sadly  this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch  my purse  my necklace. i had to go home  change  and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.
Wanted to love this top  but couldn't. the arm holes where so big you have to wear a top under to hide side boob... very light sheer material. had to go back
Awesome jeans. cute and comfortable! size down as they run a little big.
I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding  and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress  the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.
I didn't mind the "scratchiness" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable.
I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn't sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online  but the print is beautiful. it's a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back)  the underarms do not fall very low  and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.
I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings  with boots  etc.  this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.  the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).  even if i could find a size that worked  there was n
Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine  but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami)  but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs  but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer.
I thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging' style. i am 5'7  athletic and the small fit perfect.
This dress is pretty  but there were a few things i disliked.    the overdress is fairly shapeless; however  the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer  the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress  the slip  and the lace. finally  as other reviewers have shared  the buttons are not functional  and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.     i recommend trying the dress
I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
Lovely top  flattering and dressy  would definitely get another color if they have it.
It is a little pricey for what it is  but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!
I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
This jumpsuit is gorgeous...on the right body. if you have a tiny rib cage and a flat stomach and an average to short torso  this may fit you beautifully. on me  the defined gathered area you see in the photo was very tight and hit me in an odd place. the fabric is a great weight and it is a beautiful and rich looking. i really wanted this to work out for me. as for size  i found it just a little tight in the hips  waist and rib cage.
This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv
Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)
I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight. the fabric  however  couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.     such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
I've been searching for the perfect gray cardigan and i knew i had to have this one! unfortunately  the first cardigan i received had two obvious pulled threads so i returned it. i took a chance and ordered the cardigan again and i'm so glad i did. it is so comfy and goes with everything! my only concern is how it will hold up as it is already showing some fuzziness after two wears. if this makes it to the sale price  i would highly recommend.
So this is a gorgeous dress  but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more "girly" than "sleek." i am short  so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me.
I love these pants! i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing. but i love them super cute and comfortable. i wish they had more colors available. these were a great buy!
The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
I'm 5'5 130 lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite. i like the petite better even though there isn't much of a difference  the petite is about 28 inches long. it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think it's too long for that. i love the beautiful coral color  received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it. the quality is superb. the only downside is i don't like the way it looks when zipped  it doesn't give mu
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.
This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
The material is soft and the pattern is pretty  but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting  with some stretch and a zipper  because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall  very slender ladies  this will be pretty  as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top)  but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model  but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
I love the patterns and the colors! easy to dress up or down.  i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them. the cut is great as the sides still meet even though there's no closure. it's a good weight for this weather and winter! i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great addition.  it's a little itchy  that's the only flaw.
Normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it. secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra  too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle
I saw online  great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool  angora  mohair! 5'1  xsp  tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.
The fit is definitely more "straight-leg " and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!
Bought this blouse in white. fits great. can be worn with many things. dressed up or down.
I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me  overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference  5'2  24 waist  30  and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit  i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing  given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
I'm 5'8" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty  nice fabric and well made but i returned.
Great material  pattern and cut. perfect summer top
I'm 5'2"  weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.
Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim  just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage  the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!
While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
Love the feel and comfort
I love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
Just as pictured  this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional  and quite flattering. another very feminine top  and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black  of course...but also with reds  blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!
I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the "slim fit " i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it  i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad  just weird)  and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it  but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!
For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this  especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs  and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small  so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work  because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi
This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.
The colors are so pretty  a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!
I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online  but when i received mine  they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange  then more orange!!! i like orange  but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not  mostly orange on both front legs  the back of the legs have more color blocking  but barely any of the light lavender color
This is a beautiful and warm sweater  well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing  especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.
I ordered this in tan and white  but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent  i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
This is a beautiful dress  considering it is made from polyester. that being said  the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately  if you are on the taller side  it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11" and a size 10. the medium fit best  although because of the length  she is reluctantly returning it. sad  because it ha
This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however  i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves  but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer  and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i
First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.
This is a beautiful top.  the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans.  love the design of arm holes  they don't show your bra!  the only con is price  but it's a keeper.
I ordered this style in the blue  red  yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size  matching the model's photos. but  the quality is poor. the hems are frayed  they wrinkle easily  they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t
I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look  size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos). ---------- overall these are very nice. but there is one is
Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.   i'm 5'7" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference.     retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.
There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt  especially in light blue. when it arrived  i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
The material is horrible  it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not "flow" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning.
I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes  no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve
Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !
I really wanted to love this  but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter  this would be a win. nice fabric  not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips.
Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.
I love this top and the beading is beautiful  but just like everyone else  it was way too large. i normally wear a lg  but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
This dress is absolutely gorgeous. every time i wear it  people just don't stop admiring it. great material and great fit.
I normally wear a 4  and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated  my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..
This is a great throw on and go dress. it would work great with a sweater and tights or by itself in the hottest of weather. it looks a lot less awkward on than the picture online indicates.
Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small  medium and large on and huge huge huge  boxy  fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.
This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute  but better suited for someone smaller chested.
This top light and airy  which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however  this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.
This item is huge. i'm normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent.
I was really eager to receive this sweater  i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new  it is mostly shapeless  it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col
Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater  did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus  it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.
These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape  and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!
I love this dress  it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim  just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)  i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go.
I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.
The arm slits are actually subtle  and don't gape open. the chiffon type pleats are lovely  but the cotton material they overlay appears cheap and isn't dressy enough for my work.
Beautiful fabric and beautifully made  but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos  but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt  and look strange and unflattering  especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips  and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets  "panniers." if they were smaller and in the front  the dress would work. i am usually a size 4 and both the 2 and the 4 fit me well ? not too snug or to
This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be "weird".
This is the most beautiful dress! so many beautiful patterns  the zipper across the front and belt across the front is so flattering and sexy. beautiful flower applique on the hips. everything about this dress is magnificent!
These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.
This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to
This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide  it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves  ruffle) are beautiful  unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day  which fit nicely  for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size  even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.
Runs big  especially if you're on the shorter side - very long on my 5'3: frame  even in extra small. material was thinner than i'd hoped  doesn't look as smooth as on the model. this top will really only look good with leggings - pants with any detail or rear pockets will show through and detract from the look. i do like the sleeve length and rich colors for fall.
Based on reviewers' comments  i sized up and ordered an 8 (normally i run 4-6). and while the waist fit pretty well  the bust was too large and roomy (i'm a34b bust). i eventually got ahold of a 6 and the waist still fits and the bust is much better. so for me  at least the two dresses i got are true to fit. and the dress is very pretty and i'm excited to wear it!!!....i guess since it's fall i may have to wait until next year...
I am so pleased with this top! it is slightly fitted - i am 5'3"  110 lbs  - and have trouble finding tops that are flattering but not too form fitting. also it is 100% cotton  which is a definite plus. as of now it is my go-to top - looks great with jeans or leggings.
It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy  but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it  but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.
I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric  lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller  but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom  unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs  it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.
This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!
I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding  not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer  but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5" tall  125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence.
Saw this top online and immediately had to purchase it! the first time i wore it i received many compliments... even my husband commented how cute it is. as shown in the photo  the back is longer than the front. i am 5'6" and my top fell as the model's does. love this top and so happy with my purchase! i bought a size small  i normally wear medium or small tops. fit runs a little large  but small fit perfect!
I felt like a 12 year old wearing my big sister's dress. it's a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large  hitting below my knees. the top part fits my large  34g chest nicely but it becomes a wide a-line through the hips. the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesn't flow softly over the body. the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward.  i love the black and white stripes. very striking. would love a top in these colors and fabric 
This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it. will be returning it.
I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy  but made extremely well and on sale a great price!
This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft  embroidery beautiful  fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction  and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color  most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas  any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.
I kept this top  only because i needed a plain black tank  but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress  too much fabric  it just hung with  no form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quite  a bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on.   sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was very  thin.  recommend with caution to sizing.
I absolutely love this top! i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well. the top is very flattering and works with any occasion. the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra. i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments!
I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however  after i washed it the first time  it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
For a couple weeks  i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available  i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived  i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo  the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better  i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large  i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
Loved the sweater and the sale price was great  but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time  my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes  i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very  very rarely a size 0  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose  flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however  the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.    i do really like the styling and quality  so i am planning on
This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color  it's gorgeous in person  very bright  vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out  and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads  if you're thinking about buying this dress  do it  you won't regret it!
I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple  classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big  i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.
Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.
This is the rare metallic that doesn&#39;t itch - really well made (italy) - lightweight - it&#39;s a total go!    i usually wear a large - but i bought a medium (i tried it on in the dressing room - i  think it looks better &#39;fit&#39; than oversized preppy - i wear a 38b bra / size 12
This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size  but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.
Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one i've found what doesn't make me look like a bear. the shoulder cut-outs really help create a   flattering silhouette. i'm 36-30-40 the medium fits well  slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly. highly recommend.
Very elegant feel and look. love the side zip  sliming feature. great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work.
Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea
If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
I really had high hopes for this sweater however  unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be. i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really don't feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard. first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft. secondly  the actual knit also appears to be very cheap. i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits  i really can't see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m
I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however  after just wearing them twice  the threads of the leaves are fraying  and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone  or at least much less "white" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad  they were l
This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality  i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.
I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons  but i may be able to
I liked the concept of this vest  but when i tried it on  i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made  though  and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like  but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale  however! then they're all mine!)  this dress is soft  comfortable  classy  and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape  however  because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o
Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note  the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time  hence the back up.
Unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my
I expected to love this  since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine  but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just "meh." it's going back  unfortunately.
These pants are great. i am 5'6" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however  they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.
This is my third top from this designer  and normally i wear a small  but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me. i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost  but the sapphire is wonderful. works great with slacks or more casual clothes. i liked the sleeve length as well. i'm not too busty  but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem.
I didn't even notice this tee online  but in person in the store  i instantly loved it. then trying it on  loved it even more. it is flattering without being too tight. i got an xs  which is my usual size. i'm not a huge fan of the 3/4 sleeve length in winter  so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve  but no biggie  i still love!
I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
I'm a size 2 in retailer pretty much across the board - size 26/27 bottom  2 top  generally go for the xs. and i ordered this in a 4 based on other reviews. it's definitely not a winter coat  which i understood. it's not for layering over a heavy sweater either. i wish i had ordered the size 2 instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist. as is i can wear it over a shirt  dress  or light sweater  and that's fine  but unlike other reviewers i don't think you need to size up if you want the
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
So i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all  5"2. had to go back.
I bought this yesterday in store - i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you.  i typically wear a large and went with a medium.  love the grey color - it will make a nice neutral.  am looking forward to wearing this well into fall/winter as i'm in the south where it takes a while to get cold.
I tried these on to compare with a different style and didn't like this one a much (also ag brand). these fit better at the waist  but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear. i think they are really comfortable  adn on the longer legs would be great. buy f you are taller than 5 foot 1.5 inches:-). (reference  i am 115 lbs and tried on the 25)
I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
I love this denim jacket! it's just a basic light denim jacket with a casual  pre-worn  soft feel. i like how it's slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size  possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6 " 125 lbs.  and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model  i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!
For me  at 5'9"  the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length  it is cute.
This top runs a bit small  but it's very pretty. i got the ivory and it's beautiful  very form fitting. it is a bit see thru so i will probably wear a tank under it. it's simple tshirt material  so i feel like it should be a bit less $.
I bought this in coral  it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert.
I loved this jacket it is very cute until i washed it! i followed the care instructions and it still does not wash well. the arms shrank about half an inch making them a little short  i have been rolling them up
I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece  and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear  but for me  there were a few challenges.    first  the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style  cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice  too. however  i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.
This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.
I have been wanting this coat ever since i tried it on in the store a month ago. it's beautiful and well-made. it fits tts  but a snug tts  so if you are between sizes  i would order up. grab this asap while the price is right and it is still available!
Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining  huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!
I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves  so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately  i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t
This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however  the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however  the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short  but have a little wider shoulders  so  perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down  so  i had to do some cont
I'm going through a blouse phase  and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte  and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner  but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso  so flowy is a tough one for me.
The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.
Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.
Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.
Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique  received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well  a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.
I really like this top.  for reference  i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large  however  in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer  my usual size is m as i am 36d bust  132 lbs.  5"5.
I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise  it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern  interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals  and the gray and beige look good together too.
I'm a vest lover of all shapes  lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end  the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest  drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose  i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8" 140#.  overall i sent it back.
I wasn't sure about this shirt at first glance  it's difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics  with the top having a much looser weave. however  it looks great on. the blue color is very saturated and pretty. the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable. and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame. i'm pretty busty  36dd i think....i usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless they'r
The fabric is absolutely lovely on these  but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin  tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short.     i'm 5' 4" with a 30" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on  which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them  i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.    better for
Bought this sweater on sale off the website. it fits perfectly - nice length. as some others said  a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable - just need to wear a cami or tee underneath. the collar is a nice shape. fabric is a little stiffer than it "looks" in the photos.
I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.
I love this top  but i washed it once  in cold water  and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back.
I ordered this in size xl. the fit is true to size. it fits me as it does on the model. the draping is very flattering. i'm a pear-shape and this shape works well. it definitely needs a tank underneath. you could sew a bit of the top to keep it closed. otherwise  everything can show. i like using different colored tanks to pull out the colors in the pattern.  the quality of the material is outstanding. the print looks so much prettier in person. it's very vibrant. the photos online  at least on
I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and "faux" lay
These pants have great style and movement.
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.
I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium  but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue  because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but  if that doesn't solve the trick  if not recommend  b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
These pants looked worn  washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.
Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be
I like this top. i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work  but the material doesn't feel as high-quality as i had expected from the pictures online. it wasn't worth it to me to send it back  but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first.
First  this picture does not do this shirt justice. in fact  the hanger does not do this shirt justice. you must try this shirt on! it drapes so well. not as soft as some cloth & stone tops  but it is still very soft. the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up. there's no pockets  which is nice in a button down. it drapes in a very flattering way. i've never been happier with a cloth&stone garment. i normally wear a small in this brand  and that is true for this top as well. however 
I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.
Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.
It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.
I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt  a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the
The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6"  150 lbs  and usually a solid "medium" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place)  but since it is a one piece  pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large.
This top is so pretty in the photos  but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size  but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made  so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference  i'm 5'5" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly  but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect  but i'll sa
Yes  this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on  oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d
The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.
I too will be returning this sweater. love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.
Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!
I was looking for a dressy shirt i could wear more than a few times. i have a reunion tomorrow that i wanted to wear this to. i went into a store and saw this  i immediately thought this was the perfect shirt. i saw the price tag  and decided not to get it. i looked several other places and i kept coming back to this shirt. i think if it wasn't displayed in the store  i wouldn't have wanted it so much. it is so much more beautiful in real life. the photo doesn't do it justice. i ended up orderin
I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came  i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
Alas  i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy  drapey  ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral  and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.     (i'm 5'6"  135 pounds  38-30-38  and i ordered a 10.)
I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape  not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?
This dress is happy! it is easy to wear and it is lined. it came in the mail super wrinkled tho. i went for the color more than the style and while the style is lovely  i fell in love with another retailer dress in the same color so i may return this.
I love most pure and good clothing pieces  mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts  but i is very  very long and straight up and down. fyi: i have a boyish figure  having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back  so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out
I really loved the material and the feel of this item  however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.
I have a curvy figure  and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
I love this skirt. i normally wear a medium or large  depending on cut  and i bought this in a medium. very stretchy and forgiving! it's lined so it feels substantial but not too heavy. it's flattering!
Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!
The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.
Love the blue color  and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair. the hem is cool. love the big cuffs. but i looked like the liberty bell in the small. it is huge through the hips! not at all like on th model. i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms. returned :(
Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!
This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon  soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though
This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.
Great sweater  beautiful detail  warm and cozy. i will wear this well into spring because it's a nice weight for cool spring evenings. the knit pattern is beautiful and will be great for casual wear and dressy occasions as well.
Nice vest  pretty olive color  hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more "umph".
I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve  i think they do a great job with their designs!
I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!
I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n
Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3"/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total)  i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full  maybe a little more fitted  which will be more attractive at the top on me.    however  the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer  a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark
I love this shirt  in fact  i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry  it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this  but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.
I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.
Great top! a little large  but i shrank it a little in the wash  and it fits a little better now. i love the structure and pattern of this top  as well as the lovely coral/orange color. it can be dressed up or dressed down! love it!
Well  i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes  it does hide any flaws in the tummy  but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft  2 inches  broad shouldered  36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty  looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only
I bought this dress on a whim.  i am so glad i did!  got it in black.  it is stunning and comfortable
These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day  they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer
This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it's hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank  and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad.
This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.
Fun pattern  great colors and super comfy and versatile! great pickup at the sale price!
Bought this is black and white... love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk...
This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine  dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous  very comfortable on the skin  very flowy so it doesn't have a "heavy" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years.
I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day  about 60 f  with a thin sweater underneath  and it felt comfortable.     the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"  125 lb  got size s). also  i wish the lining was full  not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...    overall  i like it :))
Love this sweater  do wish i sized up for a little longer length  but works great with high rise pants.  comfy and great color
Purchased dress in blue motif. love it. it is casual and comfortable  no fuss dress. love the sexy open scoop back that is just high enough to comfortably cover my bra strap.
Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes  contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex  and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters  sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
Love the rifle print on this dress. the fit is relaxed and very comfortable and can be adjusted with the tie in the back. the fabric is a nice weight  great for year-round wear.
This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
I wasn't sure the color would be good on me (pale with reddish hair) but it is great for my complexion. on to the fit...it fits small  imo. i'm a 10  sometimes 8. i got the 10 and it is very form fitting. don't get me wrong  it does a great job of holding it all in and giving a great overall silhouette. but  it's not that comfy to sit in and i have to suck in to have a flat belly in it. trying to decide if i should send back and try a 12??
The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit  so i went a size up  just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!
I usually wear xl in tops at retailer  but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft  but doesn't breathe all that well.
I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet  i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem  the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down  like a lady and take in my surroundings  after all life
This dress is beautifully made  but it does not flair slightly as in the photo  it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.
I loved this skirt but it was slightly too small. i did not realize it pockets which is always a drawback for me in dresses/skirts. i have an hour glass frame and the extra fabric from pockets is too poofy in my opinion. beautiful color and high quality fabric/
I really like this top! it's lightweight  great quality  and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.
I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.
Looks so cute in the picture  but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....
I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.
Tried this on at my local retailer  the red color is pretty but not a "true" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it "opening" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra  this is a deal-breaker for me  it can't be fixed.
36dd  10/12 in tops  12/14 in bottoms  bought size m/l very cute pattern on the grey leggings  and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too  so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug  but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.
Color  style  adjustability  easy fit  flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic  magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no  it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!
I think the model is wearing a larger size  per the first review. i am 5'2" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap  since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it.
I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.
This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee  not below since i am 5' 3" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!
I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now  so i can't even reorder. bummer.
Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.
Soft material  lays nicely. got an xs but usually wear a smaill. got it in the mail and it is wrinkly so will need to steam it.
I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.
Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite  might work on someone taller.
I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color
I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
I bought this sweater/coat as a gift for my mother. she absolutely loves.it. it does seem to run a little large  and the sleeves are especially long. the navy and grey color combo is very nice. it seems like it will be very warm too.
Comfortable and soft material  cute design and nice longer length..however  i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me  elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic  the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.
Love this dress. it is simultaneously romantic  sexy and sweet. could be a casual dress but also worn with heels. it does run a little large but it is flowy and not meant to be super tight. i am 36d and the top isn't too tight - ordered the size 4 and am very happy with the fit.
This suit is perfect in every way! (the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size) i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit bigger.  please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!
I have other pilcro cord leggings & the black ponte knit leggings in my usual size 28 in this brand. they fit well & have a nice stretch - very comfy. i ordered these velvet leggings in the 28  the blue & the wine  & they just don't fit the same as the others. these are a little short in the crotch area & the legs feel restrictive & not much give. i have skinny legs! length is perfect though at the ankle. these same exact pants were just in at the store in black & fit a little better  but i don'
Regretfully  this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size  i ordered it in both colors  however  the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress  and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again  the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching  pulls   or tears for an exchange  but i can't pay 130" for a dress that is already torn.
I like this dress a lot  the fabric is nice  the necklines are unusual and flattering but there is definitely some added volume at the hips with the pockets. really comfortable dress.
I just got this in the mail today. it's really cute when i put it on  but it's definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing. i was hoping i could wear it both ways  but then the v-neck becomes way too low. i would recommend sizing down unless you're bigger busted. however  the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small. a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders. i'm not
I love this dress  it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person  5'4" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me  but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.
Great fit! for reference  i am 5'7"  160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!
This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.
I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it. the pink is beautiful. however  it does run large so i will need to exchange it. the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received. might not bug anyone else  but it bothered me.
These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.
I originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color  which is lovely and vibrant. the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering. however  it is also very  very cheap. after about five washes  it has pilled and worn  the color has faded a bit  and i doubt it will make it through the spring. for perspective  i wash all my clothes on cold and use the "air dry" setting on my dryer.  nonetheless  even having experienced the wear and tear  i went back and bought this shirt in every other
I almost passed this in the store  but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a "blouse" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker  so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room.
Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1')  a bit curvy and short-waisted  so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however  these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering  too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist  but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!
I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time.
I love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors (grey/rust/teal). not only is it figure flattering  it's warm  water repellent  easily layered and well made. the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique. i would say sizing is tts to a bit large. the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems.
I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times  hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.
This skirt is absolutely lovely!! i'm usually a perfect size 8 in all retailer clothes. i am curvy on the bottom and the skirt pulls slightly  so i will be sizing up. can't wait to get my new size!!!
These didn't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans. try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom! i didn't have anything to fill out the hips and seat. for reference  i ordered size 25  and they were loose in hip and seat  but fit my waist. my hips are 34.5" and waist is 28". they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear  but not jeggings thin.
Purchased the blue motif colorway which (as other reviewers mentioned) is cream  mushroom  black (heavier lines) and very dark navy (grid part). looks good with both my cropped and duster-length black cardigan. print is a nice balance between neutral and interesting. a lighter weight knit but still opaque and skims over (versus clings to) the body    the fit is very flattering and forgiving. the rushed midsection is cut higher and lower on the side seam to give a more hourglass line. the scoop b
I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life
I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
Retailer  please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable.
I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still
I'm not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand  however  these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for. they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie. they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging  so i sized down 1.5 sizes. i'm typically between a 30 and 31 and i purchased a 29 in these. initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear. the material is flexible yet sturdy.
I'm glad the previous reviews had mentioned the dolman sleeves so i was better prepared for how it would fit. you do have to do some rearranging of the fabric  but it generally stays put and isn't bothersome. the neckline is a bit more structured than shown in the pictures  but it only adds to a more sophisticated look. great fabric and color as well.
I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!
I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue.
I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt  but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat  which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious
Echoing others' remarks  this top runs large/wide (wise to size down). the embroidery is beautiful and for the volume of work  this arrived with minimal to no loose threads. however  i was bit disappointed by the mixed cotton textures - most of the top is a knit  tshirt like textures  while the bottom hem (with the horizontal stripe embroidery) is a stiffer  thinner woven cotton that i had thought would be the material for the whole shirt. the mixtures of textures and predominant knit textile ma
The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through  just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
Soft and cozy  not itchy at all  and it has pockets! i am 5'3  120lbs  34dd bra and take this in size small.
I just got this shirt the other day at the store.  to my surprise i needed a size zero. i usually wear a size 4 or small never that small.   i am 5'4 and a 34dd and it was still a little loose!! i bought the blue and brown color combination.  it looked really cute on with a pair of white jeans for summer.
This top is much stiffer  more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too  and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun  drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.
I love this dress! it is amazingly comfortable and flattering (i would think to many body types). i have a more athletic  petite body build and this dress gives me great curves. i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out! the best part is  i can wear it to work (i'm a teacher)  and then wear it out by easily dressing it up.
I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button  which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly  as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled  slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!
Love tracy reese finds at retailer! first day wearing this skirt and have already received a number of compliments! not a typical material i would buy clothing wise  but it's really comfortable and not clingy as i thought it may be. i appreciate the built in slip for some extra substance as well
Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!
When i saw the dress online i thought the print was beautiful and fun  and was not disappointed when the dress came in. the material is very soft  breathable  and easy to wear. i dress it down with a jean jacket or a jean vest but it can easily be worn by itself. it's definitely a delight go to dress for the weekends.
Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6"  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!
Love love love this pair of underwear (yes  i'm writing this about underwear). they're comfortable  flattering  and no vpl (visible panty line) without having to wear a thong.
This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.
These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.
I like the way the skirt of the dress swings when you move. in order to get the arm holes to not be too low  i ended up with the smaller of the two sizes i usually buy. i also appreciate the dress has pockets and the soft fabric. the tag says you can machine wash cold gentle which is also a plus!
Unique  sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!
Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.
Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!
The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top  lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for  and while i'm only around a b
Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated  i too consider this a dress and not a tunic  and it's not really crinkled either. the dress is structured  very soft  and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it's meant to be a bit loose  bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i'm 5'2"  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i have medium o
Amazingly soft jacket! tried this on and three sales girls all said they wanted it! the other reviewer said there wasn't any pockets but yes there are- they are sewn so you have to undo the stitching but they are there!! perfect jacket at a great price. first time i wore it  i received several compliments.
I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5"  128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though  but i was really hoping to find a nice  versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f
This dress is soft and hits all the right spots. the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like.
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"  125#  27/4  and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out
When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.
This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.
I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped  i pounced on the black. sadly  it did nothing for me. i'm a large  sometimes medium  but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price  but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back  uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an "easy" look. i've already worn this with a dress  and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6"  138 lbs and took a medium.
I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer  and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual  this one is perfect!
The beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.
This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a "cotton-rayon jersey" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.
I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green  hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b
This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large  and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is "roomy " a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous  but a thin camisol
I bought the s; came with a tag saying "sz 8". it is in fact more like a size 2  if not 0.     the bust is probably a 34 a or b  or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well  but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it  so i will return it.     the fabric  design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.
Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high  the "underskirt" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally  the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits  and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt  given the pretty steep price.
I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.
Gorgeous dress. it was designed to accentuate a woman's figure. lovely material  holds everything in place without being too revealing. the dress does not lose its shape. definitely a head turner
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!
I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless  top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.
Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new "action shots" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.
I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
I found the color to be a bit blah  and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also  because of its "chunkiness " it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model.
I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.
I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me
When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very
This top does run quite large. i am normally an xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"  130lbs  34a)  and i was debating between the xs and xsp. the xxs was out of stock  so i wasn't able to try it on for size. the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model  but it was also a little too low cut for me on top. the straps are twisted and not adjustable  so i went with the xsp  which is what i'm wearing in the photo. it does come up a little shorter  but it fits me better in the bust. the f
Loved the print on this dress  however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly  and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.
This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great  the cut is nice  etc... however  the buttons are too big for the button loops  which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on  i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it  you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.
Designs are nice and texture feels comfortable  but sleeves are odd because they are angled.  i wonder what i should do to look cool in this t-shirt.  i tried wearing neutral motif  but i still felt odd.  also  width is relatively wide  so it runs large.  i rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelings.  personally  i do not recommend this t-shirt  but who knows  it may be right for you...  so  my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo
I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals  this was out of my comfort zone  but i found this one and loved it. it's comfortable  not clingy  and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn't dropped  but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer  dressing it up or down will be easy.     i'm usually a size 12 and this fit true to size.
The shirt was cute. i'm very petite and it ran very wide so didn't fit me well.
Great  special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item  for sure.
The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
I loved this in the store  but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.
The shirt is exactly as it is pictured  i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size  as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.
I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model  and i'm pretty small on top.  overall  nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site
Unfortunately  this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also  the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally  i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more  but this dress is so cute and flattering  i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate  but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however  its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally
Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.
I got this in the petite length  size o  and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap  and really needs to be concealed with a belt  yet because it sits so high  literally right under the bustline  it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th
Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews  but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m  but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.
I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine  but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck  it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup  and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and  for this reason  would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate  because the design is so pretty.
Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.
Love this piece! i hope to see more cute  fun dresses like this from retailer. the greatest feature is it is super comfortable! it could be worn to a great number of events  dressed up or down for any occasion.
I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived  it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty  muted pink.  however  once i put it on  it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it  it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress  it would have been a yes. overall a great dress  but probably for another body type.
On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.
Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy  light-weight and extremely flattering. love!
I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted  it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however  i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.   -  the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l
This dress us high quality and feels great  however i am 5'5" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it  not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!
I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
I never write reviews
When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.
I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'" and 130 pounds.
I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8"  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a "top" rather than a "sweater." the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov
I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t
Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
Form fitting  hugs in the right spots  and love the pattern. it's a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however  an excellent evening dress.
This top is simple but super cute and comfortable. the bow in the back adds a feminine touch and it fits well (no gaping arm holes and not too tight or too loose). the white color is slightly see-through but not enough to wear a cami with my neutral racer-back bra. the xs fit me perfectly. for reference  i'm 5'6"  small busted and 125 lbs.
These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist  but nothing a little tailoring won't fix.
I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits  but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it  but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit  i will be returning this dress.
This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.  the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).  there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it's so gorgeous  i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it's a dynam
I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try.
This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large  it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.
This wears nicely  and is true to photo. flattering in the waist  and on a petite  everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially  there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone.
Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress  but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite  also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit  but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
I love this skirt... i have it in black  and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue  so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you...
It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however  in person  it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
Pretty tank  embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price  should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.
This top was really cute but the side slits were just a little to high for my taste. maybe a size up would have worked better.
I love this top  beautiful soft fabric   much prettier than picture  can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering  falls to a perfect length   great with shorts  pants or a long skirt.
I think this dress is adorable . it fits great. wear it with heels or cowboy boots. you will not be disappointed
I purchased this sweater online and it's amazing. styling with jeans is nice but to me dark navy pants works the best.
The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric  but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.  i'm sure this could have been cute  but who wants a top that looks lik
At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.
I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy  but not too big.
Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking
Feminine flow  however slightly large. such soft material. love the little details.
I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.     it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
If you're pregnant  congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs  this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d  normally a small or medium  but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me  although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides  it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve  which makes it look wide at the to
I'm taking this to hawaii for the holidays  i'm wearing it with black calf length tights and a black belt. it is fine without tights  i just like that look. it is a really great dress.
I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.
Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.
I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot  it had a flattering fit on me  extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct
This top is super cute  however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the "flutter" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!
I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay  but the orange is so bright  i couldn't bring myself to buy it.
Wanted to love this one so badly but didn't work for me. just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though!
I love  love  love this jumpsuit. it's fun  flirty  and fabulous! every time i wear it  i get nothing but great compliments!
These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though  so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants  but wanted to let you kno
I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.
This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress  at 5'7" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots. it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots.
I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline  thanks to having given birth  but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.  so why did i return it? i did  after all  get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair
I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this  one size fits all could just about do it.
These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.
Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la
I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details  especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite  i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things  then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try.
I loved the dog on this sweater  and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on  like others  i did find it to be itchy  but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are  so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable)  but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
After the second wash  the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up  wearing it  and washing it a third time  the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke  but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact  i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer  but i've already washed and worn it  so again...very disappointing. i would say
The lace on this top is pretty  and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos  but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front  it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5"--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well  and because the top was boxy already  i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"  120 lbs).
As the title suggests  i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts. i'm slim (sz 0) and on the shorter side (5'4'')  but i have "dramatic hips"  so i've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them. i'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought  so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did!  the fit is great and not too tight  allows for a little room for ladies with hips. i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little
I got this cute tunic in-store in the coral color during a 25% off sale items promotion. it's a fun  quirky piece with mixed fabrics  and can be worn alone with leggings or layered with a jacket  skinny jeans and boots. a versatile piece  it does have a few issues. i found he armhole to be slightly large on my petite frame  even in the xs; not a deal-breaker  but a bit of a pet peeve for me. i'll probably end up wearing cami under it most of the time  since the top knit portion is a somewhat loo
I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered  this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again  this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit  because
This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight  but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn't show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice  but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don't think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style.
Man  this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
Gorgeous sleeves  flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much  i decided to buy it  knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these "easy breezy" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture  i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh
I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.
Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy  dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.
I bought the purple motif in size medium  my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer.
I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots  the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.
So happy this came back into stock! beautiful trench! love the flared skirt. the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast. it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit. a must!
The stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole "loose fit" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.
I purchased this dress for myself. however  when i tried it on at home the length was too short. i gave the dress to a relative who is petite and the dress fit her perfectly.
The fabric is too sheer  also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
This blouse is not only flattering  but a great way to dress up a pair of jeans! fits well  but a big tight around the arms  had to go up a size.
I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope  it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra  and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others.
These pants are very soft and comfortable.  great for lounging around the house and for sleeping.
Sooooo soft! not a ton of shape but very versitile and warm!
Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo  this sweater is a faded  boring  teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.
I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans  and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.
This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas  it's going back.
My daughter bought this sweater in xs in white and i tried it on. it was a little too tight but long enough to wear with leggings so i ordered the red in a s. it just covers my butt in the back - not nearly as long as my daughter's. i still love the sweater and will wear it with jeans but it is way too short to wear with leggings. i don't understand how there can be such a difference in the same sweater - a size larger and at least 4 inches shorter! if not for that  i would have rated it a 5.
These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl  and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color  or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).
This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then "flare out" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look.
Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique  flowing  romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like  fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!
It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old  i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress
These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.
I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!
I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made  lined. i'm 5'5"  32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say  i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome.
This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 12 in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!
I am a sweater girl  so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers  i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured  but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi
Love the look of this and the fabric  but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0  then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
Very cute top. i ordered the white & it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it. will look very cute with jeans  shorts or skirts. love the back! wish it came in more colors - would definitely order it in black.
This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded "button gape." it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!
This worked for me  very elegant  cozy and comfortable.
I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just "knew". when i finally got home and tried it on  it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck  coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then  you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.
Extremely cute sweater  but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned  the red is gorgeous! very saturated color  just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"  135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length.
I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said " [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric." this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav
Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back  36c (34d)  short waist  and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought  so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front  but not as a high/low top would be. rather  it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater  and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"  and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid
This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design  it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.
Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.
The skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately  the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.
I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!
This shirt was a cute print  but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
I noticed this top on one of the sales associates  and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible  i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material  it is light  and summery.
Cute  but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!
Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well  i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however  because of all the stitching  the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it  it will look terrible  so i passed.
This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer  but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!
I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
Love this top. beautiful. received a lot of compliments.
I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers  i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday  am wearing it today  and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye
Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.    a must have for the summer!!!!!!
I liked this shirt well enough to order in several colors  preferred it fitting loosely (5'1" around 100-105 size small). i always look for marine was able and this fit the bill  or so i thought; was so so dismayed to see that after one wash the dye had settled strangely into folds making it look like the shirt had cracks all over it. worse looking on the moss green but still apparent in the black  both no longer wearable.  i am forced to return the shirts but since i do like the shirts i am goi
Super soft and comfy. so far not stretching out but still recommend buying down a size.
I love this top. the design is very good  i love the pleats at the back  and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l  which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style  with fitted pants it would work well.
Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office  and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer  or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body  as the top is wide on the bottom. hence  gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing  or may be a good thing. still  overall  a keeper.
Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
Oh my  i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 25 waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5" and the length is good too  not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class  sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!
I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
The adjustable tie is really nice and adds a nice style twist to a black suit.
Great spin on a basic turtleneck! i like it unbuttoned just as must as buttoned! material is super soft. good length.
I know this is supposed to be a loose  flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however  this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer  especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
Soft and cozy  the orange is vibrant  the green is more subtle and has gray tones. usually wear a small  bought the xxs ! too full and too sloppy in the xs ad small.
1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one  but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached  or "knotted" in one place  and that is not the case). disappointing.   ----------  2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle
Generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition  the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!
Where i live it's warm enough to wear this dress with tights through the winter. the dress is super comfortable with a unique shape. only downside  the arms and chest run pretty small so if you usually have a hard time fitting sleeves  try a size up.
I love this flirty  well fitted dress! quality material!
These are really cute pants. nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall. the only problem for me was the sizing. i tried my usual xs/0  (5'7"  115lbs) but they were huge - as in  pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short. the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have
This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though  i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit  which would have been too short for me to wear at work.
I loved the look of this sweater  but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches  and loose threads throughout  and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.
Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
This is a pretty dress  but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.
The ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic  rather boxy shirt. it is a nice weight and drape  but please know it is a bit short and square. i love the asymmetrical ruffle  however  and think it makes this tee worth it.
I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!
So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring  offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true  i am 5'2" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the
I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4  118#  34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out
This robe is warm  soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!
It is a beautiful dress but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin.
It looks great on the model but not on me. on me  it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.
Love these tights. fabric feels great  soft and comfy. took large so they fit perfectly at true waist for 5'6 height. some retailer tights i have bought in large  but they are too short for 5'6" person. the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.
I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings  so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived  i was equally pleased to see how soft  cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture  the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!
This top was very pretty when i got it  but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice  and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.
I loved the dress  but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
I just love this blouse! it fits well and is really feminine and pretty. i paired it with a skirt and received lots of compliments!
The neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two-tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.
I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
Second to shopping for a swimsuit  i hate shopping for jeans. so difficult to find a pair that are both comfortable and stylish. the good news is that this pair is both. the length hits slightly below my ankle which is the perfect length for me (i'm 5'5). they are a slim fit with a slight bit of stretch. i ordered the size 27 which is my normal size and they fit perfectly. love the wash for a casual look. wish they also came in a darker wash for a dressier look. all in all  i am quite pleased. w
These pants! great casual pants  i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy  and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot  they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!
I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also  the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!
This blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice  subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining.
I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however  it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool  cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th
These are absolutely fabulous!!! love them! comfortable great fabric! best buy of the year so far!
I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely  but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops  this is for you. unfortunately  i had to return it.
Beautiful shorts  good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you!
I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling  "get it off" in the fitting room. bummer.
I'm 5'5" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say "oversized styling" - unfortunately will have to return.
I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.
Great pair of pants to wear to work  and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0  regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!
The fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe  which isn't clear from the photo. much nicer in person than online. runs large. i wear a large in knit tops (36d and to hide a soft belly) but this large was too big. armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy. i'll exchange for a m because i think i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. a casual tank with a little spunk. cute!
This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.
The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th
This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews  i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however  this top hangs like a tent. also  the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar
Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.
I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented  it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
Love this. i adore pilcro  great for us gals who have thick hips  thighs and a slim waist. they fit tts and are a great staple for fall. the color says dark orange but they are as pictured  a perfect dark tan. i wish that retailer would buy more size 33 in all pilcro. they always sell out fast and i am always out of luck unless i find them when they first come out. also  please make a full length boyfriend jean pilcro! love.
Love the knit  color  texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering.
I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.
I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older
Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments  i'm expanding my comfort zone.
I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.  this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store  salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.  i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte
Love this top  runs true to size. looks cute with in style army green cargo pants.  great buy at sale price.
This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.
Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.
This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress  which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.
The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.
Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
This is one of my favorite pieces. simple  classy  and cozy!
This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70  but i think if i saw it in person first  i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute  the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels  necklace  armful of bangles  you can probably distract from the fabric.     5'5"  120lb  purchased xs and it's a little big still.
Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.
If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans  pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.
Love everything about this dress...cut  color  material and price!
A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim  orange  reds   etc. very happy with this purchase.
I love this jacket. it is stylish  yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear. the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun  and  the fitted cut flatters your shape.
This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to "bloop" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't
I'm petite  and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy  the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here  but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little "holes" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall  not a great sweater.
Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
Looks cute on! not super form fitting... more of a flow fit. love the detailed stitching! so cute! floral pattern is fun not too busy! i loved the pockets... there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit it's still totally lovely! i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all!!! i love this dress! lining makes it feel really well made!
Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on  i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes  you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami.   my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin
This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a "cheap polyester" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well.
I found this in-store when looking for a dressy  slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos  i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai
This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up  it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached  the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer  soft and smooth  and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking  from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t
I loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my 34 dd chest so back it goes. the zipper had one spot where it was tight  right at the widest part of my rib cage. it was fine every where else. too bad.
This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique  and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4  but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age  i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy
Gosh  this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing  but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details  fit is comfortable yet elegant  nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath  but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).
Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.
This says online only  hwoever the balc one was in my store (and some other colros too). anyway  i actually liked this top  it is more flattering than the model shows  i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos. on me  the regualr size is almost a dress (should i be younger)  but i do like that (i did debate ordering petite  and decided not to). it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors  and sublte stripes on the black version. noyte: previous reviewer mentioend something about
This little jacket is so soft and perfectly lightweight. the color goes with everything! more money than i wanted to spend  but i am so glad i took a chance and ordered online. it is exactly what i was looking for!
This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
This a a great sweater! it is classic  but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.
I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great. the dress is forgiving if you're trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesn't go all the way around. it's just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesn't look like just a sack. if you have a great waistline  you may not like this! i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights  it looked fine. (i'm 5' 5"  no where near as tall as the model  and it was about 2" above my
This dress is adorable. thanks to everyone who commented that the dress runs small as that's definitely true. i ended up ordering up two sizes and got a perfect fit. i was afraid the wrapped skirt might emphasize the hips too much  but that isn't the case. it adds a bit of quirky style and makes this different from the usual shirt dress. it's great with booties or chunky wedges.
Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"  115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.
I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said  it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly  albeit a little short. for reference  i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.
For some reason  the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them  as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad.
I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!
Cute and very soft  but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice  the green color is dark and rich  it has a hood. however  the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement  and the bust and hips were cut too tight  overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one  it has a much fuller sweep  so the proportions still seem right. also
A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.
The dress looks beautiful online  and fits the model great. when i got mine  the arm holes were incredibly too tight. everything else about the fit was perfect--length  bust/waist-- but i could barely drop my arms down when i tried it on. unfortunately it will be going back.
I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
I have these pants in the brown & red colors  and i love them both equally! they are stretchy  and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them  but retain their shape & neatness.
It's a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes.
Pretty color  but i was hoping for a thicker  higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion  they run big. i am usually a small (4-6)  31" waist  38" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend  but with a longer tank or shirt  they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far  wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea
The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice  it makes them look wide and short. well  that might be why these are percect for me  but on my body type (muscular bottom)  they are awesome. the material is stretchy  soft  and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color  so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs  i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly  but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal
I ordered the xl in white. for fit  it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but  the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh  crisp white shown  at least for the one i received.     the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall  i don't think it's worth ful
Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit  as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped  and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit  too  so that never hurts!
I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger  it sort of looked like a tent on me  whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though  and it was folding down under the arms  making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center  as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we
Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material  so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.
I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve
My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.
So after ordering this dress and trying it on myself i was able to make sense of the previous reviews. this dress is constructed very oddly. the top seems to have no room for any hips. it is a straight construct so if you are like me that has an hourglass shape but has a pair of hips i would size up. i bought this in a 6p and in all colors. first off the colors/ patterns are amazing in person very adorable. this fit my 34ddd bust without any problems and no problems in torso either. it was reall
I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5"  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st
I wore this dress for this first time today  and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet  and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer  the dress i rec
I loved this look! it's s great light hoodie to throw on. comfortable  nice color  and unique with the plaid later! i'm 5'3" and the xs fit well.
This dress is beautiful - it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture  if not prettier. it is a great material  the colors are beautiful  and it is perfect to throw on in the summer. i highly recommend it.
I ordered a size large  however as a large  my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.
I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s)  both hung horribly on me  they were just too big. i love a boxy  oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.
When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...
The top of this dress is very flattering. there is a lot of fabric on the bottom half of dress. if you want something which hugs curves  this is not it. however  one of the things i like about this dress is  it can be dressed up or down. i wore to a wedding and got several compliments. very comfortable
Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
High quality top  but material is not very soft-- may soften in the wash. fit is okay.
Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it! had to send back!
Just received this dress in the mail and i'm in love.  it's beautiful and fits so well.  i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but i'm so happy that i did.  ??
Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.
Exactly as pictured. great and lightweight for summer but long enough with the cowl neck to layer for colder seasons. so comfy and easy.
I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggings/tights. the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots. this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe.
It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings
Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large.
I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
I was worried this sweater would be too tight  but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!
Chambray top that is soft  but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked  the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic  almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing  and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms  and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug  whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug  it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso  so there's
On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.
Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.
I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.
I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
Beautiful and different material  like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.
I haven't worn these yet but i wouldn't wear them just to "lounge" in. i wear an xs & they fit good & tts. they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & doesn't bunch like some do. the material is soft & hangs nice. & doesn't seems like it will wrinkle. love the pattern of the black print ones. it's black  tan & white & kind of a paisley print. i think it looks better on than in the picture.
I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out  or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.
I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5" & 118 lbs  i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable  flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!
I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever  thus far  they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut  and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees  and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)
So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress  but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person  (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved)  but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.
This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy  but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.
Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt  since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one.
Soft and romantic. i love it! just like pictured and i wear a cami under. dress up or down
This is a great casual skirt for summer  color pairs well with many tops.
The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything  but the fit is ??!! at 5'9" with a long torso and broad shoulders  the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all  bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7" uber fit daughter had the same issue  and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned.
I like the design and the color of the cardigan (i got green). i like the details on the back. the cardigan is tts  the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect (for reference: 5'7"  125 lb  got size s).    the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately. it may work for a smaller lady  but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier.    also  it is not just that the material is
I absolutely adore this dress! i was nervous to try it because i just had a baby  thinking that the waist tie looked potentially bulky/stiff based on the images. i am so glad i gave this a shot - it is actually one of the few dresses that i am comfortable wearing right now. the tie helps make me look like i have a waist  even though i don't right now  while covering up some of the leftover baby weight. i grabbed this is my usual size s (27 / 34b / 5'7")  and found it to fit perfectly  plus the t
It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms  and because of the a-line  through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy  and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped  and i suspect it had been worn.  going back. not tracy reese's best piece.
This top is so cute  but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42" and sweep is over 70". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in  but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.
True to size if we take into account how some brands are making things bigger for hte size; i ordered both the xxs and xs  and xxs was more flattering (years past  xxs would be way too snug  my size didn't change). pros: i actually thought the cut was flattering on me  the top is very cute. hte bummer for me is the fabric  the grey part is not as sift as i would have hoped and the "shirt" part can wrinkle (did in the package). length was nice for both sizes  so overall  i would go smaller for a
This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck  the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.
Think price convinced me to put this in my bag ... the oops of on line shopping i guess. the strip and 'stitch' like snowflake is just not me. a little too "cutesy' for me. if strip alone might have kept .. but this is just too much  not my style .. back it goes.
I love the color and textures of this jacket. the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece.
This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.
I was excited about this dress because i love the colors and print. the dress has no shape though and not in a good way. it's not flowy enough for the look of a shape dress but its not fitted enough to be flattering.
Looks great with skinny jeans  leggings  trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.
I tried this on at the store  and though it was pretty  i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea  but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
Lovely sweater which fits true to size. i wish i would have known it was 3/4 sleeve....
Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas  the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body  but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.
The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
I only tried on the ivory one  but it was so see-through  there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size  maybe a little large  but that's the style. very cute design  loved the back. too bad.
I am a big pilcro fan. i have a really tough time finding pants that fit  are comfortable  and flattering all at once  and these didn't disappoint. the colors are beautiful and saturated  and just like they appear in the photos. i got my usual pilcro size  and the colors give me endless styling ideas. i also got them in the black and ivory print.
I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests wraps shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.
This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern  but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
The linen makes it a big wrinkly mess. i tried it on and just the act of trying it on  made it so wrinkly. i would have bought it in a second had it not been for that. love the mango color..i am in-between a 2-4 and went with the 2. i'm 5'3 and the length was a few inches above my knee...there is also a separate slip attached.  bummer.. maybe this won't bug some people but it would drive me mad. :-)
I had such high hopes for this  but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small  but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy  and the back hangs far from my body  very droopy. even if i got a smaller size  the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse  though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design  but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth  rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap
There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye  but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.
I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.
What?! i can't believe this got so many mixed reviews! i wasn't sure what to expect and now that i've received it  i think it's absolutely perfect. it's flattering  the length is great  it's tts  and the color is beautiful. i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either.  i'm really pleased with this purchase and i can't wait to wear it.
Was looking more for a tailored  blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p  ordered the 00  and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4''  110 lbs  32c for reference.
Dear retailer & designers:  just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please- enough of the polyester!   love   your customers
I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
I ordered this dress online and am struggling to decide about whether to keep it. the fabric is soft and comfortable and has a more casual look. the dress makes my boobs look awesome  but doesn't do much for the rest of my body. the main reason i'm on the fence about keeping it are that i'm not sure if i would wear it to work (the slit goes up fairly high and the fit draws attention to my bust). i think that i would love it for casual wear in the summer but i prefer to invest in dresses that are
This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy  requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!
I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt  sweater  cardigan + t  whatever  and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.
This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
Was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it's adorable! it does run large. i am 5'6"  125lb and the 2 fits perfectly. it is super comfortable. i am taking away a star only because it doesn't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out?
I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did  i love them. i ordered both colors  haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5"3' tall  my weight is around 137.5 ish. i ordered the 28 regular  and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review. i just lo
I love belted sweaters  but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage  not at my natural waist  so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it  the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.
The cut is too long and shapeless. if it was cropped  i would have kept it. the beads are delicate as another reviewer has said but i was prepared for that. too bad the fit just wasn't flattering. it's going back.
When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me  but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well  the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh
This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either  but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it
I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).
I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top. i am giving it as a gift and can't wait!!!!
This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
I love this dress (from the moment i saw it online)  and now that it is on sale  i ordered it (green). i do wish the flesh color was a little more pink  love the color in person  but not as flattering on my pale skin (i ordered a different similar dress in teal and purple  that oclor was better).    so  fit: like a glove: i am dd  in waist  lbs short = 0p. length was sexy  and overall great flattering fit. similarly to other dress  i wanted the length of this one  however. nice slightly above th
Very comfortable  flattering  washes nicely- love it!
Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
I absolutely love these pants! they are my new favorite! thank you :)
I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.
I bought the white tee. while the print is nice  the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.
I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price  it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again  not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.
I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back  in the main photo  to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!
It didn't work with my frame at all  but is very nice!
Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.
I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.
As you can see  there is an array of differing opinions on here  and i share sentiments on both:  _______  pros:  - the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.  - tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight  it'll probably fit you like on the model.   - good length  not too short or too long.  - the mock collar is ni
This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line  so when you walk  it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens  but not all the way down  so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing.   but the sizing was a bi
This is a unique blouse  it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit  but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.   the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.
The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.    very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!
I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.
Love this. it's heavy/warm  stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style.
I tried on a returned 24p in my store  they were almost the right length  but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt  and 115 lbs). they were nice though  kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey  can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low  at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.
The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.
This is a thick material  but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy  but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.
These pants are beautiful and very comfortable. i am 5'3" and 120  ordered an extra small. i had to hem them because they are extremely long  otherwise the fit is great.
I found this top in my local store. there were two colors available  this coral color and a deep teal color. i purchased the teal in a m  which is one size down from my normal size. it drapes beautifully. it is a tunic length  but not too long. i love the way it makes my shoulders look. i have athletic shoulders  and halter styles are best in the summer for me. this tank will require a strapless bra  i plan to wear a bandeau but i am not very big up top. anyhow  love this top. if it gets release
This is a light  so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!
Love this denim and particular wash. button fly will last forever. looks so cute rolled a little on the cuff.
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .
This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.
This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...
The colors in the green shirt are beautiful  however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6" 120#  not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall  wispy   less curves...
It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned  the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it "holds" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!
I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me  just few inches above my knees.  cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?
I bought three -- in part  because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said  they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now.     i am typically a small  and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes  but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.     all-i
This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft  cuddly sweater i have been looking for.
I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165  36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer  so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top  without being cutesy. love tylho tops!
Lovely sweater  good quality fabric  pretty color.   as the reviewer say  it is very thick wool pile  if warm is not what you're looking for  you may want to think twice.
I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt. it is a beautiful color! i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it. my husband said he loved the color and style. i wear either a s or m in retailer tops  depending on the brand. with this one i chose a small and it's fits perfectly. i have a petite frame; 5'2"  123 lbs.  but with a 32f bust. it is very flattering  as with most off the shoulder tops. they say your shoulders never age :) the length is just right
I absolutely love this top. it has a very classy look and can be used casual or dressy. i get lots of compliments.
This sweater is gorgeous...it is of great quality and very warm. i was very excited and wanted it to look great. however....i have a large bust and am full figured...so it was not appealing and just kind of "hung there". i feel that it would look great on thinner women...and it is a gorgeous sweater...just not for me!
Dress is so comfortable. great for town or resort. 5'7" size 6 34a and i got a size small.
I don't ever do ruffles - i'm a 36ddd - but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy. the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear. it will be easy to dress up with a necklace  blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on it's on with jeans for a casual look. if there had been the mint color in my size  i would have gotten it too!
It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt
Lovely  but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked  so pretty in the picture!
I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up  you'll love it...
This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.
Great fit in waist  hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.  i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.
This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted  with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously  the blue is sold out till may. this can b
Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf  not cute-short  just off. (i'm 5'8" and 125#) to quote my husband  "nope. not feeling these." that said  they feel great on  seem to be made well  but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)
It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec
Boxy  short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...
I ordered this dress online but it turned out to be too small. i loved the color  fabric  and overall quality. i should have ordered one size up.
I wanted to love it  but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous  but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.
I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.
Love! the perfect go-to black legging! i bought two pair! comfy waist band/not too tight  no muffin top! you won't be disappointed. buy them!
I am wearing a medium in the photos  my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.
Thank goodness chinos are in this year. i was so excited when i saw these pants  and they did not disappoint when i put them on. the material is so soft with a decent amount of stretch in them  making them incredibly comfy. they fit true to size and are very flattering - not too baggy or frumpy looking. i purchased the rose colored pants  which are basically a light nantucket red color. for reference  i am 5'8" and ~135/40 lbs and bought a size 28. i'd be very surprised if i don't end up purchas
This sweater is a grand-dad style sweater. i love the pattern of the fabric. it does run a bit large  especially in the length of the sleeves. it definitely fits a more "oversized" sort of look. i find it very comfortable & perfect for a casual/weekend outfit.
I love the look of this top. my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful. they took it back at the store and sent out another one right away.  the style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellent.  love the back zipper as well.
This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me  i am 5"3' and about 120 lbs  the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low
This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on
I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect
I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
Ahhh  i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed  this top runs very large. style wise  it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.
I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously  how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear  but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft  comfy fabric. i
I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
This is a beautiful skirt  but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.
This is a cute dress  but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup  anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down  they seemed too floppy.
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for "ironic"  it would be difficult to
Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra  even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts  black pants  and skinny jeans
I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately  even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall  it's a cute dress but just not for me.
Gorgeous design  but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric  although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
This is a really cute dress  just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size  however i just did not love it. i am 5'3" 130#  athletic build  36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets  which i cannot figure out the purpose  that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress  it bunches out. on my short frame  it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei
The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6" and it was 3" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.  an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.  the fabric is quite beautifu
They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.
Not a huge fan of this dress  will be returning it. fits too big and not flattering. fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have. color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.
What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....  the sleeves are very long and very boxy... i have no idea the condition of this on store  but came with damages on sleeves also  we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that  i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!  dissipointed!!!! ;(
Love love love this turtleneck! it's soft and cozy  and i've already reached for it on several chilly days. it definitely runs large. i sized down and it still has an oversized  swingy shape.
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!
These coveralls are not cut long enough  i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice  my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep
This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.
This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel
This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress  not a belted dress. this  in addition to the weird sizing  caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.
I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting  so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight  but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath  which adds a nice touch.  great length  not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"  124 lbs  and 32b.
Beautiful. elegant. sexy. i love the fit. can be dressed up or wear with jeans. it's great!
I am 5'6" and wear between a 9-10 pant and m-l tops depending (i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else). for this  i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection  ordering your normal size will probably be fine. the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey t-shirt would be made out of  just to keep in mind. the draping is really cool though. i would just probably hand-wash/ dry-clean  or if
I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty  perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty  but the fit is selective  so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium  it was apparently not available in the medium  i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website  medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable  but really liked the dress.
Got the green one
It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.
The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.
When i received this tank  i ordered the blue  i almost returned it because it seemed really thin  almost see through. however  once i tried it on it had a good fit  not see through  just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort  especially because it is on the thin side.
Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.
The skirt is a little longer than i expected  it hits me at my calf  i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely  very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic
These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string  which ended up working out  but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites  but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts  as th
This shirt had everything going for it - the cut  the length  the fun texture  but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing  but still cute.
These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!
I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big  but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!
The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back  as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped  so take care when laundering.
Thought i would love this product  but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.
If any of you have read the book or watched the movie "sisterhood of the traveling pants" then you will understand this analogy. i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places. it looks kind of boring on a hanger  but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much. i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body. although the design of this dress is casual  i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting. i love basic clothing designs tha
I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"  so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on  but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs
It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing! the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it!
Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight  lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering  if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!
Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.
I am curvy and this top  while stylish and i love the pockets  just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are  which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy  just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere  i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s
This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.
Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november  though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool  and not lined  and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s  its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work  serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination. i purchased the pink  which i saw online first a
The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....
Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is  and heavy .and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium  it was roomy.
Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.
It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however  the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store  unfortunately.
Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous  and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
First  i love wool. if it's 100% wool  i love it. if wool isn't your thing  then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3". it is warm and cozy with pockets  which i love. with the sleeves being short  i am wearing a long  frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice  but runs large through the hips. however 
This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.
I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on  on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.
This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.
I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful  plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty  it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute  lacy bandeau bra  the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad  since it is a cute top  and well made.
...for real  reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.
I absolutely adore peplum tops  although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric  which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on  with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski
I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big  but with a longish shirt it's fine. also  they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!
This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated  the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs  for a perfect fit. i went with yellow  which is a great color. this is not high low  which i love! i am so thrilled  that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review  i'm going to purchase another sweater in red.
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.
I bought the blue/green color. it was absolutely beautiful...i paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up. very comfortable  versatile  flexible and the color is rich. i am 5'5 and 147 pds and the m fit perfect.
After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.
I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.
Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better  but was sold out.
I really like this shirt  and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time i've worn it.
This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
Loved this top on model. even happier when it went on sale. sort of boxy. but still excited  then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric! disappointed. my other tees i purchased are fine.
Hi  i love this top. it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy. it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour
I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter  and i am so glad i did. the colors are beautiful  and the material is so soft. i'm sure she's going to love it!
This is my new favorite dress. it's a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.
I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.
First  the product arrived in a very small bag that made for many  many wrinkles - almost impossible to determine what it might look like. shame on retailer for sending their items in this manner. secondly  i don't know how individuals wear this with a bra. the back is cut so low that my bra back band partially showed - not my idea of a good look. third  the front necessitated a cami  and there is no way a cami can be worn due to how it is cut in the back. returning now  and i just received it.
Gorgeous embroidering and feel -- very soft for wool. this is a lot lighter than more jackets but with good layering can be worn in the winter. i'm 5ft tall and 150 lbs  curvy and hourglass; this hugs my curves beautifully in a size small and gives me a feminine shape. it runs up to my knees and the sleeves are a bit long which will be hemmed soon. i wanted the petite but it was sold out  honestly this is perfect minus the arms. the quality is gorgeous -- so soft and inviting to wear. it runs la
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.
Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small.
I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
Very comfortable and cute. true to size. a look for three seasons.
This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference  i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering.
This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin  and had to return it because of this. otherwise  it would have been a keeper.
I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs  not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got "lost in the sauce". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though.
I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
I love these pants. they are a beautiful color and very well made. i like the fit and the style very much.
Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. it is so cute! true to size  well made with a hint of tulle. super comfortable for moving and dancing. winner!
I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit  but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.
I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.
This is a pretty tunic/dress that looks and fits exactly as shown. i imagine that it would be quite long on anyone under 5'5" or so  since it falls maybe 2 inches above the knee on me at 5'7". it's cute  and an easy throw on and go piece. the quality is even good. i decided to return it though because it felt a little plain for the price...maybe if it were more exciting colors or patterns? a slightly more fitted cut? i couldn't place my finger on the exact thing that wasn't clicking for me  but
Love this ripple-front top. fabric is beautiful  love the lining and the fit is perfect. looks great with pants and skirts. i also love the sleeve length. i purchased this in both white and black. great for spring and summer.
I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!
I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.
I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7"/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large  it did wash up well though  no pilling.
I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.
Like another reviewer said  the pictures do not do this fabric justice. it's lightly textured but still soft! i love the fit of this--just the right amount of oversized/flowy.
These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.
But  saldly  no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good  though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue  though  is the fit. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist i typically wear a m in a knit top  but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my
I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.    still looking for the perfect dress...
I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this  but this one didn't make the cut for me.
I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.
This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust  but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust  although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.
I read all the previous reviews and wasn't sure what to think. when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store  i decided that  despite the thin fabric  it was worth getting. i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie "sabrina" and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath. i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater  so the quote showed. i got two compliments on it within a short time! for reference  i am 5'9" and 150 lbs. i bought a large and i
I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this
This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it  the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10" with broad shoulders and slim  and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition  the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.
I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.
I love this top (so cute and comfy!)  but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing  especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
This vest is adorable! i love the color  it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great  some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly  i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall  but it works perfectly with my build.
This is quite large for akemi & kin i typically wear a medium but will be returning for a smaller size.print and flow of top are stunning.
I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night  for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!
Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight  it's back  and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made  can go from business to sport to casual.
This is one of those pieces of clothing that is destined to become a wardrobe staple. the fabric is soft and generous. . the chiffon trim gives it swing and style. i just ordered another one because i know it is going to be a long time favorite..
It is an expensive panty  but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!
Great fabric  great fit  great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.
I saw this online  and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later  and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the
The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.
Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why  but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws
Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering  and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size  oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt  and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits  would be a nice 3 season skirt!
I ordered the romantic floral in s and xs to try on at home and just love the print! the fabric is so pretty and unique! others have mentioned how "thin" the fabric was but i thought it was pretty standard for a bikini/swimwear and had no complaints myself. there are removable cup liners so nothing can really show through the top. the sizing was tts and the xs fit me best. unfortunately this bikini will be returned because the fit is a little off. i love the thicker strap at the bottom of the ha
Runs small in the chest  so don't order if you are large chested! over all  very cute.
This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon  so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.  i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking  as it tended to gap slightly at the top..  for reference  i am 5'5"  125 lb.  but have broad shoulders  making my usual best size a medium in most tops and
This seems to be designed to fit a bit loose  but not in a bad way (for me). the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute  and i think this can look good with or without a belt. light for summer but still covers a lot  which is nice for the office. the sleeves are a little short  but it doesn't look bad. glad i snatched it.
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.
I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing  as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.
If you're looking for a great day to night shirt this is it. perfect transition from the office to happy hour
You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!
Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum  the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.
I agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin .......  it runs really big  it's short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture.  colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.  fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn.  i haven't one positive thing to say about t
Great denim color and fit. gives a nice feel to the waist.
First  i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes
Denim  faux fur  flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6"/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback.
Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.
This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6". i'm 5'9" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it.
Love this top! it's pretty  unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.
This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june  but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location  but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p
These cords are a great  skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy  but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome.
The quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide.
This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.
This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me  i believe. however  the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but  i sent it back.
This skirt looks cute online but  it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high  this photo is deceptive  look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini "slip" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back.
Poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality  and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area  even for me (36dd)  and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!
I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy  but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.
I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty  intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material  this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i
The pattern  while beautiful  is on a much more yellow-ivory background than pictured. the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose  like it would not support the skirt. while i did like it  i didn't love it  so it had to go back.
Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs  you won't be disappointed!
I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
The beaded shoulders make this a unique tee shirt. it turns an ordinary tee shirt into a more eye-catching one. i bought 2 different colors and love them. i prefer the little boxier fit as it is very flattering. the material is a nice weight  not too thin.
Fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.
This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top  but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.  i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.  a great staple for your closet.
It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all! it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature.
As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it  and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back  has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings  but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights  but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com
I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute  and flattering. it's well made  not flimsy  but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar  or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm
This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.
Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.
There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also  i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.
This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.
It doesn't work with me only because i have very skinny arm. i can not handle the arm part of the dress. it is still very pretty though. i would keep it if i fit the arm :(
I was so excited bout this top. it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person. the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline. i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips. it def. does not have the length as described or measured in the description. i"m 5'5" and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body. if you have tiny h
This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters  with a came underneath  or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8)  and bought this in a small.
I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it  but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash  it would help it. after washing  it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt  but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.
This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly  however  this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large  the length too short  and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit  since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
I really liked these jeans initially  but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
I received these pants today and they're perfect. as another reviewer stated  "i would definitely not wear these for lounging" you can dress them up or down. i feel like these will be my favorite go-to pants this spring. i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect
Great material  and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up  making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.
Amazing jeans!! without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets. the high waist is extremely flattering! perfect for spring and summer!
I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress  but not a major deterrent.    i'm 5'6" and about 145lbs  and the size 6 (my usual retailer size) was perfect.
Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event  i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit
I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it  so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top  just right along the hem  and then it's a hot  potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
I love this brand  i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap  reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin  and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath  you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black  and am keeping it only because i love the design  need a black top desperat
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.
Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.
Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.
These are absolutely fantastic! i love them! i stopped wearing pants about 4 years ago. i could never find any that would fit over my thighs/hips that weren't too loose on my waist. took a chance with these after looking at the measurements and they fit perfect. higher waist than i'm used (sits just above my natural waistline) to with any of my skirts  but i'll get used to it. they're also too long to wear with any flats. being that i bought them for winter  i'll be perfectly fine with heeled bo
I love this item! i'll wear it as a cover up or to dress up and go out. the material is great for summer- light and breathes.   i first ordered a small because the medium was sold out. it fit too high-water. i then ordered the large and it fits great. the medium may have been fine too. i'm 5'4"  145.
I popped into retailer the other day just to look around  and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first  then i saw the cut and style  and fell in love! they only had xs and s  and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous  i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely  and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large  but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very "peasant princess" feel to
Beautiful  well made and styled dress. perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage. i wear it with a cameo brooch.
Love the collar  cut is cropped but i'm wearing a tank under for hole coverage anyways. no complaints!
This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.
I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.
This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.
This was really cute and fit true to size. the only thing i didn't love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage. i probably shouldn't have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model  but it doesn't lay flat correctly there like the right side. either way  it's still very flattering and cute.
I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful  intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt  with the shirt getting wider and more
When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it  but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.
I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store.
Love this top! it has a great retro vibe  and the colors are great. it is very soft and great quality! i was in between a size xs and small. i went with the small  and wish i had gone with the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!
This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer  but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a
A great skinny jean  these grey beauties are flattering and light weight. they fit true to size  but seems a bit on the long side  bunching oddly at the ankle when wearing them with booties. hopefully they hold up to some heavy wear.
I bought the design which has now sold out  of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but  it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.    this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus  i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.
Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty  curvy lady this one just didn't sit right  ran a tad large  and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame  may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline  color  the quality of lace
It is a beautiful coat  runs small. arms feel tight  i am typically xs  i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted  and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat  not really fit for cold weather.
I love this poncho!! it's perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field. it's a nice warm layer  but doesn't get to hot. pair it with a long sleeve shirt  jeans and some boots and you're set.
This is a great dress. i purchased the red and gold motif. i like that it is versatile and very comfortable. plus  it has pockets!!! love that! i am fuller in the bottom  so i was concerned with the pockets adding bulk. so far  so good.
I wanted something for the hot summers here  and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design  short in the front  hitting an inch or two above the knee  but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward  and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin  and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers  it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight  but not the greatest quality
This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however  when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition  though i ordered a size medium  it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad  i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are  go for it  but get a size smaller than you normally would!
This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy  and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short  but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice  chunky  eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!
Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all. it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual  paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner  plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect  though  is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon  which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li
Very pretty top. however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering. fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides - i looked pregnant. had to return.
Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom  i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake  not sure if it's real leather.
Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived   the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7"  and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s  though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m
This top has a nice print and material.  being a full figure  it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy.  not very keen about the straps.  they're a bit longer for me  so they don't stay on my shoulders.  i'll keep it and adjust the straps.
I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale)  but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous  showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c)  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me  even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall  but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern  fabric  pockets  true to
I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric  but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also  i'm busty  34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!
I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.
I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
At 4"11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing  but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!
I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash  and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans.
This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that  i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!
This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
When i saw these lounge pants  i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!
This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.
I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.
I was afraid it would be too poufy but it isn't at all. i'd say it runs a bit large. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and the 6 fits perfectly.
I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.
I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
I really wanted to like this  but like other reviews say  the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale  but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white  as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.
So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms
When i ordered this online  i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope  it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled  or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.
I really love the pattern and the look on the model  and i thought i would love it. i ordered online  so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on  it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well  and has a lining  and the waist has extra fabric for the design  and it has pockets  so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad  because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
I bought these in the olive green  in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9" and 145 lbs  long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring.
I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.
Completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy. looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work. i highly recommend this jacket!
Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses. i found that colors are not as bright as pictured  overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight  not too heavy nor too light  it is not itchy  but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right  i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper  but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short  i had to pull them up t
Ags are the only brand of jeans i wear. they fit beautifully and last forever. i like the slightly higher waist of these angels... very comfortable and flattering  with the perfect amount of stretch.  be warned  unless you're 7 feet tall  you'll probably need to shorten these. typically i buy the angelinas  but they're hard to find nowadays. ag  please don't stop making petites! one more thing... try them on before you cut off the tags. i bought 3 identical pairs and returned one  as the fit was
Given the price  i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well  but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric.      i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale.
The length is lovely  the color is nice  the fabric feels like silk but isn't (so you can wash it)  and the cut is flattering if you're a b cup or below. for me  the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness.
This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5 4" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.
Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red  oh la la! style is feminine  elegant  and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked  i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug  nothing uncomfortable  just snug. length is below kne
I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive  run large/stretch out (size down)  poor quality fabric  and usually low cut.
I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness  simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles  pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it  consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.
I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great  if the fit works for you.
Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.
This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a great quality sweater dress and a beautiful color. so comfy and warm too. i never want to take it off. definitely one of my favorite purchases from retailer.
I am 5'4"  170lbs  34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty  and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty  and doesn't cling. i love it!
I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small  thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants  a size 32c bust  and 5'6" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant  it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr
Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.
I purchased this jacket in green  x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?  117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black  x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops.   i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what
Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!
This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big  so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!
I've been scouting retailer's store  looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.  this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe  but a fun addition. i love the fact that there's extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller  therefore no need for a cami underneath.  i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large  5'4"  34g).
I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.
I love this top! i ordered the print  and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans  and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews  and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
Love this vest. to be fair i've never met a vest i didn't like  though! this color is so versatile! i have tried it with many retailer dresses and it looks awesome with each one. this vest has made my bailey 44 gathered stripes dress church appropriate :) i am happy with my purchase at sale price.
The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size
Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.
Pretty design  but when i tried it on  the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier  it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large  however the arm/shoulder area is tight.
For an athro top  this is a good price point  especially for such a beautiful piece. it's really just a basic tee  but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and it's much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- i'm normally a size small and got that size with this (34d  124 lbs.  5'4"  36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer  i really couldn't see my nude bra through it  so don't feel i'll need a cami  because that would ruin the delicate design of this.
This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
I absolutely love this dress! beautiful prints and design. i would say to size down though as it is rather flowy. i am normally a small and went to an xs  and it fits much better. this is definitely a keeper!
Great too. love it's flow. dolan is a great brand. however it's definitely large and baggy which is fine just know it's not tight. i'm 5' 10" and 135 and ordered a s.
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.
This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however  it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo  and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.
I have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks (which i also love) great material  doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants.
In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders  the fabric didn't drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is  almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn't mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color  so pretty!
I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did  thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress.
Being that i am short  5'2"  this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5". long leggy types could easily "rock" this.
The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.
These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!
This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.
I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!
This is a nice style and pattern  but it is quite clingy around the hips  so beware if you don't like to reveal too much in that area. i do love the tulip-like hem.
So comfortable  great fit  dress it up with wedges  down with flats   extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6" and the length is just slightly cropped.
The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.
This dress fits so well  it is extremely well cut and flattering. the length is perfect (i am 5'5).  i passed on it though  because i didn't love the color. almost like a navy blue that has been washed one too many times. if this dress had more color options or made in a cute print i would not hesitate to buy it. if blue is your color go for it.
Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time)  i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and wouldn't arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.
Unfortunately  this sweater let me down! i love retailer  especially their sweaters  but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms  and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work  alas  i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year  but this kind of boxy  straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however  i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off  i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses  with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet)  and i love it.
Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
I bought this sweater on a whim in the store  without trying it on. when i got home  i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later  desperate for something to wear  i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.    this is a great sweater. layered with a cami  it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured  so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w
I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print  but when i finally received  i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model  so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on
The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
This is a really cute shirt. i love the design  color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs  i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
For sizing  i normally wear either xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"  130lbs  34a). i tried on both  and both fit  but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs. i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable. when i tried on the ivory color  i could see my blue bra underneath  and it would require a cami. the black didn't. i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck. i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button  but it's not a deterrent.
I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model  but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs  and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead  it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.
I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33" inseam is correct. however  i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!
This is a very beautiful dress  with the detail of the inside lining  with a very beautiful fabric as well  creating a double layer effect  it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful  a part of it is crochet)  but if i don't  the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"  so if you are shorter than that  i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado  i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with
The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously  seriously see-through.
Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.
I bought the cream version online  as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots  it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do  however  like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit  but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used  especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms  so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a
I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting  this one would be great.
Cute print on both sides  but far more "cheek" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.
Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.
I love almost everything about these jeans.  color  fabric and rise are perfect.  unfortunately  they bag at the knee on me.  should have ordered a size smaller than my usual  but since i have worn them  i will keep them.
Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did  it is lovely! i can't wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"  i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)
This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.
Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy  which i like. absolutely fabulous!
Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.
First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.
I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer  it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online  it would
Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.
I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but  it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully  unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut  make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but  for wearing at home in the summer  they're worth having. the m
Loved the green color  the cut is super flattering  but alas  i do need hte petite  ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely  the color is sold out in petite :-(
I am a 5'10" size 4 (or 28 long - i need a 33-34" inseam) woman. i bought the s/m and they fit perfectly (with all the excess length bunching at my ankles  as designed)! i'm thrilled. i bought the light color. one thing  wear nude underwear and lighter (or just short) socks - these are definitely see-through! however  i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways - something always reaching down to my upper thighs  at least. so comfy and cozy!
This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am
The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back  so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review  i am not thrilled about the hook and eye  but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.
I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts  and it is very soft and comfortable. however  it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it  but i am doubtful. so b
I ordered the white "denim" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering  but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!
Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.
The shirt is nice  but not as nice a material as i was hoping  but i kept it anyway. but after washing it  it is even more disappointing  not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me  but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.
These shorts are great  both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size  i bought my usual size  26  and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted  which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!
I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore  so i bought 27r  knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better  and it fits a tad loose ev
Love this shirt. i have a bit of a tummy so i usually don't buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great.
This dress is amazing. i have it in almost every color. it is incredibly comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down. love it!
I don't know how this dress looks on your monitor. on mine - it looks dark green. which it is! i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as "slate." that aside  it was a bit too large on me  and since i am on the shorter side at 5'4"  i looked a bit like a child's doll in it. i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful  and so is the quality.
The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it  but when i turn to the side  you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end  not the most flattering.
This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft  but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.
I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also  it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.
Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too!
This sweater jacket is perfect. it is gorgeous  casual  unique and a closet must have! i wore it for the first time to an nhl game with black jeans and a red tee and got tons of compliments. it is a medium weight knit and so works well under a jacket in the cold winter months  will be perfect for early spring as a stand alone jacket  and also in early fall! a beautiful basic with a pretty accent ruffle that is sophisticated and adds just that little something special! it runs true to size  with
I loved these pants. loved them so much that it pained me to return them. but  i used shout stain remover on them once  and it drastically faded them in the spot i used the stain remover  that i had to return them. i'm grateful to retailer for standing by their product and taking the pants back for a full refund. i'm tempted to buy them again if i can't find similar pants elsewhere (and just stay away from the stain remover). but  i'm still undecided.
As soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one  but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.
So this is actually a holding horses dress  its mislabeled on the website. tts  a stunning vintage inspired piece  very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut  this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small  fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!
I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.
I feel that for this price  i should love this top (and i wanted to). however  the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top  and there were a few things about it that could be improved.  pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally  the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and  generally speaking  has a nice pattern. overall  it's a very pretty top.  cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!
I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it  but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall  i am slig
Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
Was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.
I really wanted to love this dress....     i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly  the top was just too "balloon like" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.
A really beautiful  well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress  but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.
Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.    the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th
40% sweaters...i couldn't pass it up. unfortunately  when i raise my arms  my tummy shows (i'm 5'6")  so i had to return it.
Beautiful color; however  the fabric did not work for me. tight on top  large on bottom.
Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4" too long. i am 5'8" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants.
Cute pattern  but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.
Disappointed this didn't fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides  and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it's really pretty!
Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached  which i appreciate...no fighting with straps  etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"  130 lb  34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy  just to give you an idea of my shape.
I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops
I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still  it is so romantic  feminine  distinctive and timeless.
I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses  but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while  and it finally went on sale  then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas  and if fit like a glove. for reference  i?m 36 bust  30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being "sexy/conservative". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching.
Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great! i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you can't see my belly. i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus.
I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.
I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top  so i'm curvy  which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l  and while the m overall fit me better  the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d  and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!
I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.
I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large  i usually wear a large  and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad  it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.
I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!
I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes  and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however  when i got it in the mail  the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up  but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt  but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size  i would have gotten it  but this shir
These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so  this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!! i totally recommend -- just order a size  or maybe two  up. though  to be fair  maybe peti
I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute  but serious size issues  i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!
I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5 9" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said  the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely  soft and i liked the gray color  but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.
The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out! retailer  please bring back another iteration for spring!
I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.
I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.
Great color. great length. will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeans/pants. this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold.
Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.
This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs  bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!
I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.     my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress  i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink  i would've hand wa
The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful  and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.
Absolutely beautiful -   usually don't leave reviews here  but this top (material  beading  style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso  so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous  but with the right pants and heels  it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student  i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.
I'm 5'4"  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.
This shirt is adorable.  but...it didn't work for me!  i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"  34g). i tried on the small  since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight  yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much  making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back  and i would have been in love.  love the blue color!
This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it
This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape  and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint  and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating  is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating  but not enough that i won't keep the dress.
Beautiful dress  but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off  i definitely don't!
First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas  but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall  if you're considering this jacket  take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.
I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
I love this top! super soft fabric and beautiful with jeans. getting ready to retire and will make this a regular in my new wardrobe! thanks retailer for putting it on sale!
This is the softest shirt  super comfy  very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up  or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft  i love it!
I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly  but a little baggy under the arms  and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1" and the regular length worked for me.
Usually wear s and xs  tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers  green on outside  and a polyester beige layer underneath.  but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different 
I got the blue and love the color. it's bigger than it looks here! almost like the model has it pinned in the back...but it's swingy and super cute and fun!!
I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful  but ended up returning it. first  it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second  i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third  it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture  it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns  but then i know it would have been too short for
The reviews are accurate that have already been said about the material and size. i usually wear a size 2 and i bought a size 4. it fits perfectly. the blouse is very sheer  but if you wear a neutral colored bra  it should be fine. i like the flow and cut of this blouse
Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect  i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!
I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say
This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.
The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too "swingy" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1"  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.
I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference  i am 5'7" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way  but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise  it's a great  casual piece. the material is light and soft  and it's cute over leggings.
Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better
These are really nice jeans (i am a jean fanatic). some "patches" are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them. very distinctive and nice. they are truly a boyfriend fit...so  if you them big  they are. ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality. i buy other brands  but not often...
Loved my. mustard colored ones so much  i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!
I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size  but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy  just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last  but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!
I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders  a problem i haven't encountered before. i've tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?)  only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise  it is so pretty and flattering that i'll be truly sad to send it back.
This skirt looks great on  i didn't even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design  not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last.     then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
Fits nicely  casual and lightweight for the summer and i like the look of the cross straps in the back. no complaints!
Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight  not too thick and not too thin. they will run  so be careful when washing or putting them on.
Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft  smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!
I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this  but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.
I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice  flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap  and i do not have a flat stomach  so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.
I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber  which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked
The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace  color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite  for reference  5'2"  24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.
I"m going to a wedding in dec and looking for something different.. thats where my retailer comes in...their is this beautiful lace jumpsuit staring me in the face saying im what u r looking for! i'm 5'4 117 and the petite size 6 fit perfect!! love the navy blue color!. all set i am ready!!
This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however  there's no way that model is 5' 10" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that  and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress  it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty  but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!
The color on this dress is absolutely gorgeous  the fabric is great  and the bow detail in the back makes the dress much more interesting. i also quite liked the length. (i'm 5' 5" and weigh about 132 and bought a 6 regular  which came to a couple of inches above my knee....not as short as it looks on the model.) overall style and aesthetic  i love.     the problem with this dress is the fit. i tried it on in the store  starting with an 8. too big  no problem. tried the 6  still a bit large (gap
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!
This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black. ---------- unless you are very small framed  i would recommend sizing up; or  if you typically wear a m or a l  go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips)  large biceps  and a 34b chest  and i went with the l because
I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however  something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a
These are cute  comfy and just as pictured; a soft greenish-gray but i didn't find them to be super flattering on me  or at least not slimming in my view. i'm 5'3" about 105 lbs.  and got them in s/m which fit just right  but they do go all the way up to my true waist. they are "tube legs"  meaning they're not contoured tights. so there's excess fabric at the toe (it'd be all bunched in flats) and there's a tiny bit of looseness at the ankle. there's also no distinguishable front or back (and no
This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
This shirt is so soft and lovely  i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage  but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is  but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however  i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke
The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.
Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking  i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies  if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.
This top is so pretty and the fabric is really soft...but  it does fit a little bit small in the bust. i am not extremely large busted but the buttons gap open just a little and it's tight across my back. otherwise  i love this top and the colors are really  really nice.
Yes  this is a sweatshirt  but one that you can wear in a a variety of settings. it's a little boxy  but i can fit a bright colored t-shirt underneath during the cooler season. be warned  the band around the bottom runs snug  which wasn't a problem for me because i have narrow hips.
The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no "shimmer" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.
I had high hopes for this top based on the photos  but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it  almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.
These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive  and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords  and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect  i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.
Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?  runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt.
This appealed to me online & it came in petite. during the promo in july i decided i shld order the petite small while they lasted although way too hot to even consider wearing until fall. glad i did. i am short & the regular length wld be a bit too long. great color & quality. not too thick or weighty. like that it's a cotton blend. will go well with the many skinny jeans/cords/leggings i have. love the blue. now i have to wait a few months to wear it! 5'3"  117# & usually wear a size small in
I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations  weddings  romantic dinners  tropical va cations....heck  i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!    i am 5'7" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf  just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would
I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.
This is the second top i have purchased in this design  the first being in the navy blue color. i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture  that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color. this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within.
This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute  but a little bit odd  it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.
I can't wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic. it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it.
I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment  or spot clean at best.
I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4"). i'm thinking about having it altered  not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out  it may be a better length for taller individuals.
I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.
Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.  beware: pockets decorative only.  runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined.
Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip  though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
Ordered this top online  color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous  comfortable and flattering  so much so  i am ordering the navy too. great quality   fabulous with jeans .
Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.
This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine  but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight  so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2.
I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
I just bought this dress and love the fit. i'm pear shaped and it's very flattering! it's not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape. it's also seasonless. it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono.
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between  size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6
I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a "diamond" shape ;) large chest  moderate waist  large hips  and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either
I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.
Really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !
I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it  i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.
I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail  the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size  even for an oversized piece. order a size down  even if you want a boxier look. unsure how the fabric will hold up-but if it does it will be a great get.
I bought this dress in an xs  and am 5'4"  115 lbs  and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug  but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.
This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans  so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way  bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle  but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.
These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great  and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities  because the petites are all sold out  and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7"  they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4"  you may be getting them altered.
I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).
I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors  drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.
Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
I really loved the fabric of this dress  however  it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.
This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2". the arms fit--length and width  but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model  but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.
I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself  and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter  or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering 
Would have loved this skirt  but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!
I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!
Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft  smooth  and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely  no squishing (as the other reviewers have said  the chest has room!).     i got the gray  and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso  my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum  and i want to hide the st
This top arrived by mail this morning  it is beautiful even prettier than the picture. fits true to size and is wonderful quality. cannot wait to wear it when i leave on vacation this weekend.
This top is so gorgeous! the color  the embroidery  the neckline  are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part  but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.
I'm 5'4"  usually a small in retailer sizes  6-8 pants  i purchased the 8 petite
I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit  but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right  which would be okay. however  the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing.     it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments. its unique and super-pretty in person. it hides flaws well and the material is nice. i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like. i don't mind the way they look  but..the way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down. speaking of bra straps  the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin
Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very "retailer" piece so most likely i will keep it  just a bit disappointed.
This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality  even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...
I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.
Like other reviewers have said  this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return.
Very warm and snuggly  gorgeous color  nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right  but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i didn't like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.
I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.
Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!
This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.
I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.
This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.
I usually love tops like this  i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.
I love the material & flow of the bottom half of this dress  it fits like a charm.  for reference i am a 34-29-38/39  the size 6 was spot on. that being said  i was a little disappointed by the top portion of the dress; the dolman sleeve seems odd & the faux wrap is gaping & doesn't seem to clip in the right spot  sloppy  not like on the model. the dress would be perfect as a full sleeve & a little snugger of a wrap. i could alter the top  but the material just wouldn't lay right to the waist.
This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall  i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.
I rarely write reviews  but this one deserves one. this top is completely  utterly  adorable! it flows so beautifully  which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party  and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand  and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!
This dress is very cute and super comfortable. as soon as i walked into work  i received a compliment. the fabric is not heavy  but actually on the thin side. if i knew this dress was maeve  i would have sized down. i'm always a large at retailer  but with some maeve items i need a medium. for reference  i'm 5'9"  175  l/12. i love the look of a drop-waist  but because of my big bust i usually look silly  but this works.
Comfy cozy!
I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them  i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut "keyhole." i am sooo happy with my purchase.
The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)
Non-stop compliments! i wear this with dresses at the office  and denim on the weekends- super versatile.  this is one of those pieces that you keep forever.
This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isn't easy to see online. however  the skirt is quite puffy  which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person  just be aware o
Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.
This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.
This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are  but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium  but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.
This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.
Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite  but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4".
These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
I ordered this in a size s  my usual size and it fits great. i love the color  style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of  ever so slightly  poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color  i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!
Overall this top is very cute. it needs to be ironed before you can really judge it's cuteness! the sleeves are short and feature gold toned plastic buttons. for the price of the shirt  i thought the buttons looked cheap.
I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6  128 lbs with some boobs  usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs  and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose  hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy  and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips  plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon
The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
The front and back of this square sweater are the same  and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice  but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped  so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted  but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
Beautiful dress  i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.
I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2  125 pounds and usually  wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small  but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine  but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed  but it looks ok rolled up too.
Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft  i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!
I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions.
This top was so beautiful  exactly like the image shows but the waist was so tight. it was uncomfortable enough that i am going to return it. sad because the top and arms fit great. i am an hourglass so my waist is very small compared to my top and bottom. oh well  next time!!
This is cut very strangely  i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming. it is more fitted than last years style.
I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!
I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7" and found this to fit perfectly  yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!
This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the "madeline" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city  so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all  a girl has to make a good first impression...
I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat  skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3" 36dd 140#.
This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp
I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate  i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
Normally i would never try on anything with horizontal stripes.... but for some reason  i saw it in my store and gave the dress a try. fit is perfect  and dress is lined. (side note: my store had the navy dress and the stripes are horizontal and not diagonal as pictured on the model- dress looks like the ivory dress.) can be dressed up or down  so ill be a great summer go to dress. i am a curvy girl and because of the different widths of the stripes the dress works and is very flattering. i'm ve
I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets  as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise  it is a great color and shape. still sad though...
Runs large. very stretchy. nice wash. mine had more holes and fraying in the legs than i expected. i returned them because i got the wrong size and smaller sizes are sold out. otherwise a cute jean and with the sale  certainly worth it.
Thanks to the vertical stripes  the adjustable neckline  the bow that cinches the waist  and the free flowing skirt  this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist  but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just
I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight  but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently  nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric  i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded  and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"  weigh 134 lbs  and do typically wear size medium.
This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream  but wow is it short! i'm 5'8" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse.     because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt  i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies  but tall & curvy ladies beware.
The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.
I really love these jeans! this is my second pair of ags and they're so comfortable. i will say that these jeans are super long! i have long legs and it takes a 3 inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly. if you're short  you can expect to get them hemmed. the high waist is great! size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently!
Fit is "breezy" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front  as in the picture  but i still liked the dress enough to keep it.
These were very nice  but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist 
Currently wearing right now :)  purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l  and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath  as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.  a must at the tag sale price!
I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately  there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 "3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.
The design looked super cute online  but in person  the material seemed cheap. actually  at least in the green one  the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material  it would have been much nicer.
I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy  but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they don't hold up  i love them that much.
I liked this shirt so much i ordered a second one online in the same size but different color. unfortunately the second one is much shorter than the first and looks less like a tunic or more like a cropped flowy top - not a good look. so the second one is going back. otherwise the shirt would get 5 stars. washes well  super soft and comfy  and looks great with all kinds of bottoms...jeans  cords  leggings. wish it came in more colors. i typically wear a m or l in retailer tops and took the l in th
I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately  when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.    it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th
Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1"(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!
Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out  which i'm bummed about  but matched it with a funky black top.
I wanted to like this top  especially because of its comfortable material and color  but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small  and although the bodice fit okay  the sleeves were long  and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.
I'm 5'5" and got the m. i thought i'd need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on!
I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"  36c  145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it  but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too
I had to order this dress in three different sizes to get it right. i'm 5'6" and 125  but have a petite frame with curves  so i ordered the small petite; the sleeves and length were too short. then i tried the small regular  and i swam in that one; way too much fabric. the i tried the xs and it fit perfectly. it does stretch around the bust line  so wearing a red bra would look tacky as you can see through the lighter fabric  but black or nude is fine  or even a slip or a tank would cure that is
I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.
This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.
Lots of embellishment  striking magenta color  feels great on  with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!
This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler.
This top is all around great for summer... i've worn it to festivals  for casual workwear  etc. love the colors  they're vibrant. this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it.
The front material is soft and cozy  but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit  like long john material  very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it  only tank top. other than that  it's a great deal
Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately
I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time  thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i don't live close to an retailer  i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal  this sweater however i was swimming in  like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn't impressed with the material either  it f
Beautiful top that will go with anything. looking forward to wearing it.
I purchased this in navy and love it. my only complaint is that is is a little big in the shoulders. i am about 5'4"  129 lbs and the small is still a bit too big. aside from that  it is a great design and length and i've worn it both with jeans and leggings / boots.
This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy  but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight  light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all  lends to the casual look. total keep for me.
Luv this top/dress/coverup..runs a lil big...i sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans! fabric is nice  comfortable and light!
I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might  it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second  the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one  but the center of the blouse was so offset  that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
I have worn this sweater many times  i have received great compliments!
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall  wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.
I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice  but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl  but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.
I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a "t".  it's soft  pretty and covers my wide bottom well.
This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
The fit on these is starkly different than the "black hawk" version also being sold online. i could barely get my leg in those! i typically wear a 27-29 - a 28-29 in this brand of jeans - and the 29 fit great. i have very large calves  so most "kick out" cop flares don't really provide the full effect for my body type  but these worked really well and i could definitely see the flare at the bottom. i am 5'8" and these hit right above my ankle  just as pictured online.   ----------  what made me
I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.
Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle  such a bummer  sleeves are much longer  and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger  in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it  but consider the mentioned if buying.
I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews  nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern  burgundy wine faux fur collar  the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did  this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!
Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great  i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.
These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel  perfect fit  great look  especially for dressing up and going out. love them.
This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt  skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.
I absolutely love this light  soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.
This is a beautifully made sweater. i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday; i wore it today and received many compliments. i think the sweater is adorable. it?s soft and warm; the neck is perfect  i like that it?s not as restrictive as a turtleneck. the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting. i highly recommend it?i?m looking for a black one 
This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package  as the color was darker than on the picture.  i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design  it isn't for me as the color is too "winter".
For reference i am 5'5" and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design. the skirt fit perfectly  but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt. the quality is great but the design and color is not. the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture  more like a dark red wine. it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric
I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly. fits tts (5'8"  160lb - sz 8) and is really flattering. it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w/ the right bra. purchased it on sale and am so pleased!
The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a "pooch"  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung
Several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles. it is not embroidered  but an attractive popsicle print. i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p. a bit roomy in waist  but with tie at waist it works. length great  but arm holes large. will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering.
I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this "dress". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said "are you kidding me?!"  by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i don't know which dress the
I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..
I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!
Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape  but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long  but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides  but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.
Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-)
I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.
Great light-weight blouse for mild fall days. fabric is thin so not too warm  which is great for southern california fall. great color palate.
I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up  skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w
I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference  i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
I grabbed this pair of pj pants on sale  and i'm glad i did. the material is soft and lightweight-- ideal for summer . they fit loose but true to size for a standard pair of pj pants.
Love the rushed sleeves  and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is  however  a little thin  hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt  jeans or other pants for casual days!
The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!
This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy  but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!
Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long  but fits pretty true  like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.
I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7  flat chested  135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer  because i do not consider myself tall.
Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
Purchased this sweater in an xs  grey pattern (for reference  5'4"  small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey  but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!
Beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk. i suggest one size down if you're small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly.
This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges   so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute  especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on.
There's a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free. really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf
Nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.
I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.
This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape  comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s  and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more  although that will make it easier to wear during the
I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l
Ordered this on a whim  in my normal size large  and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft  fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.
Pretty and with pockets! also  nice quality for the price. interesting texture.
I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
I love this comfy top  and if it couldn't get any better  the pleated back makes it extra special! it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together. i purchased this top in the green and i'm absolutely enthralled by the rich color! i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better  however i believe it's up to par with the price point. i typically wear an xs/xsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look  but otherwise i'd go for your normal
It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality  like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall  not the dress or quality i expected :/
The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was "ok". just didn't love it.
The high neck and "square-ness" did not work for me .. but might for someone else.
Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips  this might not be the top for you
Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.  oh well  it's going back!
I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day
It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...   however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy
This looked more fitted on the model. the xs was still boxy on me  but i loved the eyelet hem so much i kept it!
This is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren't fans  but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103  32 b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area  however  a different story. because it's boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly
Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend
The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.
This shirt has beautiful colors in it. it goes with burgundy  grey  black  brown  blues  and denim. it's a generous cut  and quite lightweight for fall layering.
The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.
The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately  it runs quite small in the bust  so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted  it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size.
Normally i would not have bought this color and print  it is just not a color that i usually wear. but after reading reviews i ordered it online. i love love this top. it looks good  is flattering  and is a very nice and different color. i wore it with berry leggings and love it. the top is very comfortable  can be worn with pants and leggings. the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front  it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o
Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy  and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit "off " as the background color is a gray  which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large  as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow  but it was very tight all around  especially around the bust area. going to have to return this...
I was so excited for this to come in the mail  once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive  it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough  unflattering shape  too masculine  too boring  too wrinkly  or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter  but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple  plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me  year round. i have other cloth & stone tops  and have loved them all. their
I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"  143 pounds  and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants  depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute  unique  work-appropriate  and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black  but am really glad i got the red.
Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well! this is my first pair of pants from retailer. i always have the "too tight in the thighs" and "gaping at the waist" issue but not with these at all. i was so surprised. i purchases size 26 in both tan and blue. the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable. a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway;)
Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"" and i generally wear a 6  the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!
This dress is more beautiful in person. this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders  chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy  this dress is awesome!
These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!     for reference ( if you decide to try your luck)  i am 5'7"  128# and my normal size s was perfect.
This is such a cute little top that can be easily worn off the shoulder or on the shoulders. it is comfortable  soft and quite flattering. it hangs nicely and is a pretty white top that will come in handy this spring and summer. i stayed tts on this one but could have sized down.
This top is not quite what i expected  but it is good quality and very comfortable. looking at the tall  willowy model in the pictures  i thought the top would be about tunic length and hang straight down. in reality  the design adds volume to your frame by cutting out in a kind of a-line from shoulder to mid-thigh. in fact  the shirt is so long and has so much flare that i think if i had ordered the regular size rather than a petite it would actually make a cute dress. for reference  i'm 5'4" a
These are the cutest prints  but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt  which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless  both my appropriate size  which i still felt was too short  and the size up  which hit at a flattering spot  were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size  the shirt runs very wide.
This is a great quality product with unique design
I tried it on while out of town. i was concerned about getting it home but i kept thinking about it. i purchased it online once i got home. the colors are beautiful. it's a swing dress with quite a bit of "swing". this is perfect for me because i'm sensitive about my mid section. i wore mine with 3.5in brown sandals. my husband said i had "legs for days". i'll take that as a great compliment. i usually wear a medium but could have worn the small in this dress. i preferred the medium because it w
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.
I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips  one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.
These were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12  but i had to squeeze to get them to close. they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.
Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me  a friend  and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.
The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5"there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots  flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined  but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.
It's such a beautiful skirt  i kept it around and tried it on with every top i own but i could not get the right look. the waist "poofs" out right below the waistband so any shirt worn over it makes you look frumpy. tucking a shirt in didn't look right because of the poof. it doesn't do anything to flatter a figure. the skirt itself is gorgeous. for the price  i need to make sure my clothes make me look good too! reluctantly i had to return it. i was hoping it would be my summer go-to skirt.
I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.
Okay  so this top has its redeeming qualities  i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this  it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton  not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though  wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav
This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l  if not a medium. sadly  it's going back :( otherwise  it's high quality and a beautiful design.
First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.
So soft and comfy.  fits great  love the length.  i am sure it will get much wear  great addition to my wardrobe.
This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material  maybe washing them would help  but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
I agree with other reviewers that this top runs large - i'm glad i ordered a size down. it's a cute twist on a basic tee shirt.
My new favorite! i wouldn't have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store  but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress  i caved. i needed a petite  so ordered a sp and xsp. the length on both is perfect. i'm 5'0" and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides. i didn't try on a regular in store  but based on the sp/xsp  i'm pretty sure there'd be too much material for a petite frame. the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist  i'd proba
The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not  hang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it.
Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer
I recently purchased this dress in the yellow  which is not advertised online  but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also  you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9" and the length was perfect for me  will be able to wear with heels or flats.
It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.
I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it's very cute on.
I wish this dress was just a bit longer  it was beautifully made and i loved the colors  just too short for me.
Got this in wine  very pretty and soft. but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans  pencil skirts and capris .
I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.
I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled  but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny  and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny  not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again  maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle
I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty
Love the top  but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly  the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo
Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3" so it works well
Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came  it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back.
I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl   wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full   a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th
This top is so cute! love the stripes in the red print and the detailing of the buttons. however  it does run slightly big! i'm 5'8"  145 and got the medium. it's so low in the front that i do have to wear a cami underneath. i see why they designed it a little larger since it comes up on the sides and it's supposed to be more of a relaxed fit. i typically love when shirts are long since i'm a little taller and this one hits perfectly in the front. it does dip down in the back and covers my bum (
This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!
If you look closely at the photos  the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved  navy blue cardig
This is a great layering piece. got in orange color and it is really a beautiful shade. i am 5'3" 36dd and went with a m. very flowy  nice length (more on the short side)  and not see through. i am able to wear without a bra  where the ruffles cover any possible chance of seeing anything ;). i have a black came from another brand and have literally worn it to pieces. goes well under a jacket for work  a kimono  wrap  denim jacket  just anything! i was a bit disappointed it is "dry clean only"  h
These leggings are soft  comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.
I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.
I love this top  the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely  both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft  allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly  it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores  otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.
I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically  wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray  i thought  they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash  the weight of the fabric? not sure  but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly  i will be sending them back.
The first day i wore this jacket to work  three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy  looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all  the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus  doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!
This is a beautiful dress. it's a great weight  unique pattern  and has gorgeous colors. it's fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom. i am a 10 or 12 in pants  10 dress right now and i bought the 12. i am 5'8" and 175 lbs  and 36c - also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing... also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath. i love it and bought it at
I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust  otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.
This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
I'm 140 at 5' 8". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium
I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color  soft  flowy  fun  practical.
Love this t-shirt  its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs.   the color is a little brighter than the picture.
I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress. i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering. i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small  which i usually never wear  so i would order a size smaller.
Would recommend  but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over  even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5" 120lbs narrow hips  usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned  plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow  the material is really nice  soft and comfy  color was good (i ordered the dark)  and i could imagine they would be super cute
I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it  it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
I like it a lot - very soft  just enough detail to keep it interesting  but still a classic look. i got this in a small and it's a little short on me compared to the model. i'm 5'6"  long-waisted  34b (small side)  145lbs (carry bulk of my weight in legs.so trim on top). i will keep the small but also get a medium; the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i don't tuck them in.. i got it in black  so can't comment on the orange or red.
This dress was beautiful in person and the blue is almost electric in color. i wanted to wear this to a party for a club i belong to  however the bust on the dress is to big. i'm 5 ft tall and 115 lbs with 32b bra size. i got the 2p as i was worried about it being to tight. it fit perfect except for the bust. the way the top is cut and the black sheer fabric allows part of the bra to show in the cleavage area. not worth they one to have it altered. will return. sad because it's a fun dress to tw
The fabric is really itchy  i felt like i was wearing a carpet  and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.
I tried the other dresses by this brand and they were short and didn't fit well. but this dress fit better i bought the orange size 8 and it fit good with a swing to the bottom. for reference i am 5''9   34dd and thin and this fit well with some room. this time they got the slip right and its not tight and the length hits right above the knee which give an overall better look plus the long sleeve balances out the dress. i'm going to wear mine with tall brown boots.
Loved this sweater but too boxy
Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
This top is really beautiful  but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband  i looked like a star trek villain.
This dress i received is stylish  comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length  goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well  although  i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up  but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!
I love love love this dress! i am 5'4" 117lbs and got an xs. it's just barely small on me but works great. it looks amazing and i can't always wear maxi dresses. they don't always work with my body type. this one is perfect. the color is gorgeous. i highly recommend this dress.
This top is perfect! i love the fit and the length and the weight of the fabric! it is thin without being sheer. i just wish there were other fun colors...
The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7" and slim  but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing  the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant  but the top fit just fine.
I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever  so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online  but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it  and the colors were more vibrant  so i thought  why not try it on  though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant "i'm buyi
As a teacher  it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful  that i can wear to work  as well as on the weekends.
This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful  overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.
I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart
I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.
So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.
I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened  i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece
This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..
Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.
The colors on the tank were beautiful i didn't keep it because i have a few similar tops  but i liked it! fits true to size with an a line shape
I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person  if it is still available when the price comes down  i might buy it.
I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says "cold water wash". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!
Dig this top but a little different from what i was expecting. the outside is indeed a bit stiff and scratchy but it is lined ... but definitely would've appreciated a softer fabric. however  the cut is cute and flattering and the pattern is adorable so it's staying in my closet. perhaps not the thing to wear to snuggle up with someone though!
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
This is a great piece  which has flow  grace  and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time.
This dress was ok - i thought the fabric was soft  but not my favorite. it's a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down. but  i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my - would be better on a different body type.
I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust  5'5"  around 116 lbs)  but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic "flaps" laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
Very nice long-sleeved shirt. the fabric is soft and warm. you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket.
I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.  this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.
Looks great from the front  but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
I am 5'8 with curvy  muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.
I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump
High quality  yummy soft fabric  gorgeous color. even with those three pros  this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2" and 150 lbs  size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one  however has capri pants  hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall  thin woman  it probably works!
I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.
This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it's perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it's not too drastic. i'm 5'4" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless  it's a great dress.
I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however  the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter...
I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
I bought this mostly to wear around the house  so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.  that said  this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose  and it doesn't really hang well over my hips  which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy  which is nice  but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling  bu
Too much fabric  not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
Beautiful and good quality dress. the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline.  you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it.  unlike the model  i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me.
Walked into the retailer store in new york  while on vacation  and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made  soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!
This is the perfect tank. it's super soft  great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all  it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!
I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not  but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric  the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.
I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of "blousing" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!
I ordered this dress in navy for fall  and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small  and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy  making it more modest  but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower
This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.    i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.    the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows.
This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso  but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion  though  so not sure if its just me and my complex. if you don't have a short torso then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.  overall  i am not sure who this was designed for.. but
This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size  though a bit boxy  so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side  but i'm petite  so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear  but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
I ordered a small  which is my usual retailer size  but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long  a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
Wanted to love this.. love rompers  but the opening between your chest was oddly designed  it was gapping and certainly couldn't bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full  made me feel frumpy..
This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big  especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!
Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts  just as shown on model.
I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately  the shape is "a" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so  it will be returned.
Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white  because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe.
I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s  depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy  the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.
I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large  but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style  it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly  plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of "cozying up" in colder weather by wrappi
I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back  since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight  and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable  even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold  i am sick of neon!!!!
Soft cotton front  slightly more coarse back. shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out. bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well. could also imagine with skinny jeans. normally wear a s  ordered an xs.
I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights  but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday  and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink  but from an arm's length away or more  it looks beige wi
I love pairing this skirt with edgy tops  it plays so well with the detailing! i'm usually a size 8 but sized up to a 10 so that it didn't pull  other than that   absolutely love it! beautiful all over
This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer! it's very comfortable and fashionable.
Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel  they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself "hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo." flash forward to me trying it on in my home - "yep  that's some side boob." it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning.
These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant  thinking  "what do i have to go with this?" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the "winter white" trend happening this year!
I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but  once i washed it (in cold in my machine  reshaped and air-dried)  it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
For me  this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
This is a good basic casual skirt  and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts  but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8  which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though  even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy  and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.
Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe  but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft  cozy  and cute  though.
Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!
I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.
But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly.     reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist.
These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle. i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift.
I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.
I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price  figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size  but the front drapes against your body it
I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer  so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath  but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1"  and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work  as it hits me slightly above my knees.
I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
I loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back  unfortunately. beautiful styling and color blocking. just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for.
The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women  but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large  even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed  as i loved it in every other way.
I ordered this coat because  like others  i was taken by its feminine beauty! unfortunately  the coat showed up with the top button broken off (and missing) and another button hole torn open. i returned that coat right away  thinking that it'd been damaged somehow in shipping. however  i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button! when i tried on the coat  i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket. not the quality i expe
I wound up returning this shirt  because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall  and long waisted  but slight on top.     the shirt is gorgeous  and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..
This dress is really cute  it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case  but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight  but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle  but a steamer is your best friend.
I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short  i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1"). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately  they are all sold out of size 24 :(
This shirt is cute  nice cut  but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.
I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease  modern look  and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years)  but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this "easy" skirt  and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi
This is a lovely blouse. it has an empire waist type cut  which camouflages tummy and hips nicely (especially after a large holiday meal!). i'm usually between a small and medium (4-6) and didn't really notice much of a different between the two sizes.  **note: it does not come with the camisole shown in the photo  but any black or white standard camisole would work.
This dress is adorable! i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter' s bridal shower. i received so many compliments. it was comfortable  stylish and best of all wrinkle free. i actually ordered it online and when i got it  the dress required no ironing of any kind. love it! i think i may have to get in in the red also.
The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!
The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!
I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff  silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.
I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag  my first thought was how could retailer send me a used  washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top  not exaggerating. i'm 5.6  ordered the m  don't waste your shipping money on this.
So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso  wear a small 34c  and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky  it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out. the constr
Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green - such a beautiful piece! size seems true to size  and it elevates anything you wear it with; skirt  jeans  shorts....if you are on the fence  jump- you won't be disappointed.
Not sure what to think! i had great plans for this dress
Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.
I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
Super soft and comfy  with stylish look
I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.
The fabric is divine. it's a thin polyester knit that just floats on your body. it's soft and drapes wonderfully. it's like wearing a nightgown.     the styling is so sexy. it looks really alluring but it's actually just a plain ol' tank top with a bit of a sleeve dangling at the elbows. it's very modest really.    the silly thing is  it tickles! yeah those dangling ties tickle your arms when you move. lol    i bought the grey in a xl and the fit is perfect. it says "dark grey" but it's really l
I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3  it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough  it should work for you!
I bought this dress in black with the polka dot pattern  and the style is adorable. i love the empire waist and the fit is very flattering. the v does come down a bit low  but a cami can be work underneath for more coverage. my main complaint is the fabric. it is very thin and wrinkles extremely easily. luckily the dark color hides this  but it's a bit disappointing how easily it wrinkles.  great style with leggings or tights - really an all-season dress  though. ran very large for me - i purcha
These chinos are very well made and has a really good fit. not too tight but a bit more relaxed so depending on the look you are going for  these are great! however  i ordered the bright aqua pair and received a pair that is really more teal. a bit disappointed but i'll live. i'm 5'4" with a 30 inseam without shoes. these hit about half an inch below my ankle when not rolled up twice.
This sweater is so lovely  i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
This top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10  12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...
I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.
I'm 5"5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller)  a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug  but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party  or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.
What a disappointment and for the price  it's outrageous!
I purchased the moss green version of this sweater in a m petite. i"m 5'3  135 lbs with a full bust. i love it! it fits beautifully  and i have received many compliments on it - from both friends and students (and for a high school teacher that's high praise).  when i saw the purple version i debated...two of the same very distinctive style? the answer was a resounding yes! can't wait!  the only minor warning about the sweater - it was very itchy on me the first time i wore it. second time - ok!
I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.
I bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee. the gray is light and as pictured in the photo.    i bought an xl and the fit is tailored  with some loose flow to it. it is not boxy or big on me.    the fabric is a soft  soft  thin cotton knit and very cool for hot  muggy summer days....esp. in the southern us where it can be pretty intense. since i bought the gray  it's not sheer  al
I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago. i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color. i love it! i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall. it has a substantial weight and is warm. this sweater/poncho has a great drape that is really flattering  especially in the back. it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath. i've worn it with a turtleneck and button-ups and it looks rea
This top looked really cute. when i received  it the fit was not flattering. it is snug on top and very loose  on the bottom with an excess amount of material. it made me  look very disproportionate. i returned it.
In general  if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress  you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale  but it's a pass for now.
I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color  a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium  and it was too tight in the chest  and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7"  128lb and ordered the small.
I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a "straight down" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a "flare out" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut 
This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup  and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now  at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band  and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure  but it fits perfectly there for me.
This has become a go-to work staple in my closet. soft  with a relaxed fit  makes this a very easy piece to work the day away in while still pulling off a dressy casual appropriate for my office. highly recommend
I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected  and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
Sexy  yet sweet and demure? all points checked with cute little number. this is the third byron dress i've bought and like the melodist  i purchased the 8p and had the same issue--too loose in the hips
I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8") and don't want to wear a crop top.
This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made  heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool  buy it. if not  pass on it.
I wasn't sure about this top when i saw it on line but it is actually nicer than the picture. it is very flattering and the color is perfect for the summer!
I did not experience the issues the other reviewers mentioned. wore this to a wedding last month and received many compliments. beautiful  comfortable dress. the bust fit well -- slightly large on me (i am *just* a b) in the size i needed  but not horribly so. love this dress!
I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.
Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess.
The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy  flattering  and elegant  not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
I saw this on line this morning and was hesitant to order one size smaller so decided to visit local anthopology store with fingers crossed they would have it in a size 4. i'm 5'5 130 and a size 6 usually in retailer clothing. not only was the size 4 perfect the fabric and quality are excellent. nice flowy pant legs and the top has a one button adjustment on the shoulder if you don't want it too low. either way worked for myself. dress up or down. this is a must!
Just bought this jacket on sale and i love it! it's like a soft compfy sweatshirt   love the longer length. i feel like it runs pretty true to size. i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine. the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad  the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that. i would highly recommend this jacket  just love the feel and look of it.
I bought this on a whim  and i love it. the colors are much brighter than the photo would indicate. it's definitely a poncho - oversize is the name of the game - but it's cozy  gorgeous and i wish i could wear it every day.
I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
This dress fits and flatters a curvy silhouette. size medium length is perfect for my 5'7" frame. utterly comfortable and so many compliments!
It's beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium  which is what i got  it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
Super long even at 5'7" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me  so even at the sale price they're going back.
These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.
This runs small  i got the size 3 which fits like a medium  not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit  it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
As another reviewer noted  the upper portion (back  chest  shoulders  etc.) fit nicely. however  the body of the dress was enormous and did  indeed  make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
I ordered the red/navy and i love that its a true red and navy. the subtle ribbing adds the right amount of texture. i normally order size small but i felt the top was a little big and has a very long hem line. i'm hoping it shrinks in the wash and i might alter the hem if its still too long after washing.
I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say  i won't be keeping the dress. the layers  fabric  and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.
As other reviewers mentioned  this sweater is truly nice in person. i love the different patterns from the fabric. the cut is also flattering  not boxy. the collar on me turend the other way around (dark showing)  and it also looked nice. i wasn't planning on buying anything  but it was thanskgiving weekend  with  you know  discount :-# not regretting it...  i will wear it many ways: jeans and tshirt for weekends #if i get out of my workout clothes#  but also could be worn over a nice black blou
I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2"  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s
It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it  but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.
Great arm coverage  soft material  flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.
Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top! i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it. i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size 6 which normally is perfect in maeve tops. this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange. if your on the fence  go for it!
This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit  but not as a layering piece.
This shirt runs large in my opinion. i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it. its a great shirt  good quality and i'm very happy i got it.
This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
Overall very pretty.
Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50  even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish  and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri
I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.
I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back
I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters
I tried this shirt in the purple motif  it fit true to size  my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor  though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric  while soft and comfortable  is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears  the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.
Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!
These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic  but ultimately decided to return.
I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm  soft and super comfortable. however  they stretch out a lot  as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house  but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable  but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"  130 lbs and the size small fits well).
Great top for day to night. fine for work (i'd think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned  but b cup and below doesn't gape so very work appropriate.)
This top has a lot of potential (comfortable  easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small  medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model  too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.   i tried the green in the sto
I love this top! i was hesitant about purchasing based on the other reviews but i'm so happy i decided to order this beautiful top! i'm 5'4" 115lbs and the xs fits great. it does run a lititle big but i like slightly over-sized tops with skinny jeans. the xxs probably would have worked as well. i definitely reccomend giving this top a try but size down if you are going for a more fitted look. the lace detail give this staple piece a nice added detail!
This was a splurge piece for my fall wardrobe. however  i will be returning it. it's extremely heavy and bulky. the collar doesn't lay right--it's tall so it wants to flop over but it's too bulky to fold and stay down. i went a size down and the sleeves are huge--wide and too long. it's not flattering on my figure--i have a booty but the sweater doesn't show curves at all. i also thought the colors were dingy  not bright like the photo. i think it would look good on someone tall and slender (als
This jacket is extremely good quality  has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected  but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.
I've noticed this sports bra several times in my store-along with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didn't feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer. i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it. i like the back with the extra strappy open section  but that is where it ends. the fabric is not particularly flattering  and i didn't think the bra accentuated my chest. i do have a small bust size  but i have a lot of sports
I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole  it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea  but not practical  even without a hole =)
The skirt is very pretty  but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference  i'm 5'7" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price  i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times  then decide.
Sctrachy  short  boxy  stiff.  loved the idea of this sweater  but this was not what i was hoping for
I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
Love the blue color  different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff  but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.
I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me  however
I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color  the fabric  and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.  now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i"m surprised a
I was at my local retailer this weekend  needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the "get it while it lasts" section  in my size. i tried it on (top in two different sizes 32c and 34b and a bottom)  and it was literally the only time in my life i've ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results! great material  the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric  supportive top without squishing (went with the 32c...same as my regular bras)  t
I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
This is a fantastic sweater--really soft  great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer  and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose)  but when my arms are lifted out to either side  it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one.
This looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.  a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top  faded  ripped  rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.
I bought these pants in white and tan. they are comfortable and fit great.however  they tend to stretch. i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose. i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable.
I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8" frame. wish it came in a tall size!
I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.
Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.
Although $$$$$ i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options .i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays  a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed. i am only 5'2" and these were just longer than capri length  more like the close-up view online. to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips  not sure how the tall model did that! i am 106 lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s  these run
I saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful! it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy. this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring. highly recommend.
Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on  which is a first. was very cute in theory  but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large  i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will  though.
Great top!! can be dressed up or down. the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing. i found this shirt to run pretty true to size.
I love this tee! i got the navy color and the quality is good. it's a light and soft linen that is opaque. (i can't vouch for the other color though). it's a very loose fit but it's not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge. i'm very short and the xsp comes to my hip. i'm almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too... the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide  it might show
I adore maeve tops  and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a)  ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3  105 lbs  ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely  but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on  either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit  so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing
Lovey top in the photos. however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3  118lbs  36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.
The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.  i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
The color of this is beautiful. i'm 5'8" and had to order the s because they were out of the m  so it's not as dramatically long on me as on the model  but otherwise fit - sleeves a little shorter too. the m would have been better. but it is a little scratchy wherever it touches my skin  so it's not worth the $$$ to me. going back :(
The dress is very cute  probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee  which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin  but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.
This shirt is so beautiful and fits perfectly. it is so soft too  i didn't expect it to be so soft!
I never buy anything at retailer full price  but had to get this when i tried it at my local store  especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering  and super comfortable. fully lined  not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out  or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics  i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low  but on me that is not the case. the t
I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also  the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream.
Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect  shouldn't fit tight  should flow  has lots of room  it is linen  adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.
This is the perfect dress to wear casual or dress up a bit - perfect for fall and super comfy!
I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.
Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.
This is a very pretty color. loved the flow and the length of this top. however the neck hole seemed too small for the top. all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff. going back
Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless  i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an
Well made dress  but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty  but the dress is too long  as well. as other reviewers have said  the front is too low cut  but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me  sadly  i'll be returning it.
These are great for summer except you need to size down! unless the pair i received was an anomaly  these run very large!
I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual  yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress  i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace  this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly  comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up  but want to wear something that is not fussy. and  the pockets!
I got the yellow ones and love them so much i ordered the stone color. very comfortable and i can wear in th office or on the weekend. thinking about ordering every color! i love the pilcro hyphen line. fits my 5'4" frame and athletic build perfectly! i'm 135 lbs and wear a size 28.
Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!
I absolutely love this sweater! first of all  it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top  but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length  which i normall
I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n
I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did  it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.    very bummed  but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers
This is a great top  not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!
I saw this on the rack  and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece. i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase  but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price. runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size 4 fit perfectly.
This tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable. it is a bit loose  but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body. i lose my waist a little bit in this  but think it's a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage.
I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now  and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny  thin  and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting  a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very "gypsy-ish"...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of
This is a lovely dress  but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress  and i didn't need another casual dress  so i sent it back  but it would be fine if you want something casual.
I really love this pair of fitted cargos. i'm 5"1  103 pounds and bought a 25p since that what i take in most jeans at retailer. it is quite fitted like it shows on the model so some may prefer to size down for a comfortable fit. i bought the grey color and is a lovely neutral color. love these and may have to go for another color!
This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.
Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it's that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.
I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also  thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center  went of your way!!
I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
While the styling is cute  the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.
This is a fantastic dress! i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments. the fit is phenomenal; the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. i am full-figured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size. this dress would look good on an 18 year old or a 70 year old!
I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made  with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn  blue  white and grey  seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave  but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack  but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small 
Yep  absolutely tickled to death with this top. light  airy  cotton poplin with personality plus. such an aesthetically pleasing piece! i haven't been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time! this blouse speaks to me...i am 5'5" 142 lbs and the size eight was a tad large-might have gotten a six but this is fine. it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says 'belt' or 'tuck' anyway! the neckline is just too much! it gives such personality to the piece. the open ne
I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately  i couldn't make the fit work. for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers  i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms  and i don't have particularly large arms  so i ordered the sp  hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately  the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l
I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.
This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon  and that's the problem i think.  i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck  it was a bit l
While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.
Gorgeous top! very beautiful and easy. can be dressed up for work or just worn with a pair of jeans. note the fabric is semi sheer so a nude bra or cami is a must with this but it's going to be fantastic for summer!
When i first put this dress on  i immediately thought...oh no  i can't pull this off. at least  not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe
Love the clean lines  the texture  and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist. the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like. it is a stiffer  but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body. the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets. . fit: runs large in the waist. the size 2 i have measures 27" on the top inside of the waistband  and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth
Lovely  lovely dress  great quality. unfortunately runs rather large at the hips. i wear a size 2 and the xs fit well in the chest but large at the hips.
Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online  but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!
This top is really comfortable  and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming  but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well  but it's fine. the material is a nice light weight  but the pleats do fold up a little after washing  so ironing is required.
I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this "coat" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
Sleeves were tight  was difficult to put on ?. for the price  you want to love the shirt. sending it back.
I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this  i would say size down two sizes.
I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback  but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference  i have a 33" waist and 42" hips.
Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
Is gigantic-it could be so cute  but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low. i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds  and a small was huge on me.
This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.
Sheer top  runs big  usually i'm a size medium  but got small in these.   very pretty! great summer top.
This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans  white jeans  shorts  dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!
I really love this tee! but  the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.
Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite  especially on top (5'2"  110 lbs  34a)  but have a healthy butt and hips  which can make sizing difficult. in this romper  i tried a regular xs  and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me  but not overly so  and the arm holes didn't gape  which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great  as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which
I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales  and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty  comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic  this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra  and when i adjusted it higher  the soft  stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue  and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame  but i
These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13".
I love the colors in this dress  it's very feminine. however  i wish it came in petite because even the xs is too overwhelming on my frame.
As other reviewers have said  this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall  just under 6 feet  and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined  but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!
I bought this top in the wine color. i just love it. as soon as i wore it i received compliments because it has so many unique details. i bought a medium and it was just the right size.
Beautiful color and flattering design! cons: tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing. i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron. i didn't even have a chance to wear it  but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price.
This caught my eye in the store last week  and i decided to try it on. it's the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear  but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it's very flattering and i found it to run true to size.
I am not quite sure what to think about this top... color is nice  cut iis pretty but the material is denim denim....it would probably soften with wear but the deal breaker for me is that i have a vein in my neck that pops out like crazy when i wear the top. if i release the neck it goes back to normal. not that it is tight but apparently it blocks flow somehow. so i passed.     i tried on regulat 0 and it was fine at 115 lbs. 30 dd chest
This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery  colors  crochet lace  tassels  wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.
I really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame.
I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.
This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a "life "in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or i better say  it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately  it stretched more than a full size  and generally lost its shape. now  the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore.
Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.
When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however  when i examined it and proceeded to try it on  i was really disappointed. the quality is ok  but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d 109lbs  5'0"). the bottom part fit. sadly  not impressed. this one is going back :(
I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t
I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.
I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers.   obviously  based off the
I love the neckline with the pleated ruffles and tie. it's graceful and distinctive yet still understated.
This top is very pretty on the hanger. however  i have a curvy bust  and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy  too high of a neckline  unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely  and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.
I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so  when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter  the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust  and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more  but that's just the way it was
Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (5 ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!
I bought both colors. the navy is beautiful but the grey is closer to a drab beige and the color really disappointed me  i'll be returning that one. i love love the fit and feel of the sweater. it drapes wonderfully whether open or closed and it's so soft. however  the fabric pilled significantly  big pills not even little ones  where my arms touch my sides after just four wears. !!! i get that rayon is finicky but that is ridiculous. the navy is now out of stock in my size so i guess i'll try t
For me this is the perfect blouse. alone or with a cardigan it's a winner. not too low cut  armholes are perfect. i would buy other colors if they were available.
As soon as i tried on this cardigan i knew i had to have it. it takes your outfit to a glam and high end look. the fabric is oh so soft and i loved how it draped. the sleeves hang low and give you a vintage feel. i would give this a 5 star rating however  the downside to this cardigan is the shedding! it shed all over my black pants when i wore it  and on my friends too! :( i really went back and forth on returning this  but i think it's so beautiful i am keeping it. i am hoping over time the sh
A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.  the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.  i chose the white. it definitely runs large  so size down (i.e. wear m/l  chose s).  the fabric is linen  very itch  so tank is probably needed underneath.  flattering fit for curvy figure.
The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.
I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however  the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.  i am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come.
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.
I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n
I'd been eyeing this for months  loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it  with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack  so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt  it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh  and contrary to what other reviewers have said  i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.
I'm 5'3" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6  but could tell that even if i had the 4  the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice  with a fitted slip design.
I tried on the xs petite  and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big  you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also  the material is soft but thin (see through  somewhat). the xs petite  just seemed big overall  i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs  30dd for reference.
After readying the reviews of this dress  i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy  was i wrong! first  this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall  the entire dress was not flattering. honestly  i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great.   the first time i pulled it out at home  i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side  the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for
This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.
I really want to love this dress  the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large  but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy  to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also  it has lining which is nice for modesty  but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining  it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k
I love  love  love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone  and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid  and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back  so you cannot put it on yourself  unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.
I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12  so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides  it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them)  then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol
It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!
Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity  but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight  so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.
While i agree with the previous review that the peplum hits a bit high  i like this top. it has other features that i really like. the dip in the back of the peplum is great and i love the longer sleeves. i have it in both the black and the mauve and they are becoming quick staples in my wardrobe. i have a fuller figure and feel good in this top.
Love this! saw online  didn't place the order and when i came back it was gone. retailer restocked so i got it second time around. ordered the red option. this shirt is beautiful! sometimes the online photos don't do the piece justice  but this time  it's even better in person. the embroidered detail is gorgeous  the fabric is light weight  and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linen-like in look and feel. the fit is just as pictured imo. bringing this on vacation with m
Pretty tee  but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful  but fit is blah.
Wore it to a cousins wedding. loved it! probably one of the best dresses that i have ever worn. lots of compliments. felt great dancing the night away.
Love the detail of this top; however  it runs large and had no shape on me
I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man
I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight  soft  flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
I see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater  and only available online  i thought i would contribute an opinion. the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo. it has a wonderful feel! the style: this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else. it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely. i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple  is also a stand
I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!
I am normally an xs or s in tanks  so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric  but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6  but will try the 8 if the local store has it.
Love the block appearance. looks exactly like on the model ! material again could have been better. dry clean only  so expensive wear. price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down.
This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water  line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water
I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color  but the fit was huge  no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose  but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color  but the execution left much to be desired.
I think 4-5" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs  but still feel comfortable running errands  and these fit the bill. they are short  but they are loose  the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice  wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day  wore them 2 days in a row  all day  everywhere  got lots of compliments  comfortable  washed and air dried  ready to go again. i am typically a 12  ordered the large  could probably
I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress  and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist)  and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i"ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline  or perhaps skip a belt altogether
This top is lace done extremely well  i love the silk  the double attached layer  and the length. dress it up or down  this top is a definite show stopper. it does run small in the arms though  size up!
I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it  but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.
Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly  fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length  just touches top of my thighs.
Plan to wear this with pants. may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling  but i recommend trying on before deciding. truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light. would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight  but still not a bad value.
I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size  as i had to size up because it was the only size available  and it is a little large in the stomach and rear  but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also  it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase  just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more
I love how this sweater fits. i was reluctant to get it because i thought it would be boxy  but it's a perfect length  especially for a higher waisted pants or jeans. the fabric is super soft. i only gave it four stars because i thought it was going to be grey  but it's more like a marled black/white  80s-style color.
These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them
Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!    material: super soft and comfortable  almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person  the purple/grey is lovely.     fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j
Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory  black  grey  and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.
I love the look of this dress & had high hopes  but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful  fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6"  155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide  so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small  but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang
This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it  even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress  which i feel this is. once i tried it on  i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point  an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft  comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
Very comfortable   looks great on. like the color & fabric. something you can throw on & go
I ordered size large and find this to be way too oversized  wide  long and unattractive on my frame. the print is just okay but since it doesn't wow me  i'm returning.
Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft  cute design but not flattering. returning
I work with children and have a casual dress environment  this top gives me much needed style to my work wardrobe.
This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.
I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant!   for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.  the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one
I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad  i would have bought it for sure.
I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap
I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo
This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up  however.
I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs  i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t
I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.
This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut  and that the buttons are covered. however  the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly  i don't think i can recommend this shirt  though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body  but it still looks great. i hope this helps!
I loved this jacket the minute i saw it. saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands. even cuter on than the photo. short back at natural waist long in front . great quality fabric. thick and warm. fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath. the medium is perfect. back is stylish  solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front. sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edge.overall very interesting grey black c
I really liked this dress. ultimately  the turtleneck isn't as flattering on me  but it was a tough choice. the fabric is nice  the style is nice  and it would be easy to wear.
It sits a little short but works great for a jacket when you don't want to have a big winter coat when going out.
This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel  but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!
This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on  it looks like a lovely dress. however  it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei
Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.
I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
I can't get over how fabulous this looks on  how well it fits  and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding  evening out  or the office.
I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy  but also well-cut and lays nicely  not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.
Cure pants --- just bought them --- they look black but the description says "blue motif" - does anyone else have them and know if they are black or blue?
I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma
Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it  and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top  but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium.
I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.
Great top. i ordered online because i needed a white top that i could get away with wearing in fall to work (even though it's white). i'm "busty" and normally shirts like this make me look gigantic (like i'm going to tip over) but this was a very flattering cut and fit. i highly recommend. it was also comfortable and i wore it with blue slacks to work (the flower is partially dark blue). i'm 5'8" and the length was perfect. not too long in the butt but enough to cover it subtly.
I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful  drab actual color.
I was really excited for this sweater  its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design  i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it  i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#  36dd  i hold my weight in my neck  shoulders  back  upper arms  tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)
I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2  but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.
I love this top. it is perfect fit. i am 5'3 102lbs  32 dd. it conforms to your figure.
I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer  but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy  honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the "red" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots  booties  heels  clogs  flats  sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7"  140 lbs and tried the medium.
I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in.
Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.
Really like this dress but.....  the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.  impossible!  has to go back
I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy  irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty  it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!
I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
The sleeves are fitted which i love. works with a belt or without.
Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6" and a classic size 8 and this
I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however  being 5'10" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.
I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!
Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29" inseam  you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small  my inseam is 27"  and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however  the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip. i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather  go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser "slip" with them to prolong the need for cleaning
I'm a size xl and i'm busty  so my review might not apply to everyone.  .  i really wanted this jacket to work  however  it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted  so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath.  .  the style of the jacket is very
Very cute  very flattering. the peplum is fairly subtle and really works  falling at just the right place for me (i'm 5'5). i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans. the color is deep and works well with my pale skin. the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time - always an issue with sweaters.  unlike some of the other reviewers  i found it ran slightly large. i am small framed but large-chested and often take a medium in sweaters  but a small is roomy o
The jacket is cute  it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.
I ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great  either. big and boxy. it could acco
I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work  but when i tried it on  i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through  and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return  unfortunately. if the top came in other colors  i would return for a larger size  but i can't deal with see-through work tops.
Love this shirt  can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!
I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.
I'm so glad i splurged on this sweater coat! wow! this is the kind of product i come to retailer from! very unique  good quality  flattering  and surprisingly soft! i wore this over a sleeveless dress for a few hours and not only was i very warm  my arms weren't itchy or irritated at all... on the contrary  it was quite comfortable and soft. this is a bit pricey  but i will definitely get good use of it. i found it to run true to size. i typically wear a 6 and ordered a small. my only quibb
After reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust  and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis  so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference  i'm 5'6"  a straight build 134 lbs  and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk
There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a
I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose  but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.
I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4"  134 lbs and a 34c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual.
Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however  every time i put it on or took it off  i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.
I read the other reviews that said the shirt ran small but i found that it fit fine and i chose my regular size in maeve. the only issue is that it's baggy around the middle which is a little off and i found that it was a little too short. i gave it four stars because of the print. i chose the cat print and it's just so adorable. i might try to have the shirt taken in at the waist and then it would be perfect.
I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus  and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.  the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.  i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.
As in most ribbed camis  this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.
I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly  they will be going back.
The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"  155 lbs)  would look great on someone more slender.
This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.
Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking  but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!
I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans.
Normally wear a medium in most retailer tops (5'9"  150lbs).  would probably need an xl to fit more like a tunic.  right now  in the medium  fits more like a tiny shirt  but more for fitting.  arms are also tighter than i expected.  will be returning.
Dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning. :(
First  this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured  however  it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep  but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.
Love this shirt  it's so comfy for fall/ winter  but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!
Comfy  gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing. the white is totally see through just fyi. i don't think it's the best quality but totally worth the sale price. i got the m and it's loose and flowy in a good way.
I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow  not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy  though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to
I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight  very nice cotton  i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3"  133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress.
This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.
I have the jeans version of these pants  and these run smaller and they're a little thinner than jeans. i like the style  and i looove the jeans  but i'll have to exchange these for one size bigger and see if they work.
I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
The title says it all...  perfect go-to tank for underneath tops. smooths out lines. purchased in a large  so if you're between sizes  may want to size up.
I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite  it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement  it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model  the back is not straight  but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price  it's a no-brainier purchase.
I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but
This is a truly beautiful dress  and yes  so much better in person.  upon examining the dress  however  i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places  there were some frayed ends  and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250  and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so  it will be a keeper!
The lengths is what drew me to this top. i love the simple look of the cowl neck. nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look.
I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you  as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all  and while there is a bow in the back  the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review  but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top  not something special like the picture is o
This is my new favorite sweater and i want it in all sizes. i have the ivory and now the taupe-totally would have bought the green had it been in stock. the red is a more rust color  but it is still gorgeous. although the knit looks and is looser  it is still very warm. i wore it today and was a little too hot for this mild day. it is longer so it can be worn nicely with leggings and still look great  but it has a good fit and shape so as not to look frumpy. love. tts  but could also size down i
I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.
I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
This bathing suit is absolutely fabulous! it makes me feel like i stepped out of the notebook! definitely worth every penny!
Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it's out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well.
Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors  print  and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!
Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good quality  i ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.
Quality  length  size  design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person  but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool  but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours  still great when taken out. thin  but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!
Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall  i really like it and have already worn it multiple times.
I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful  however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long  so additional hemming required  otherwise fit was true to size (5'3  130 lbs  size 6p)
I fist saw this dress in the window in alexandria  va olde towne and i immediately said that i have to have it. upon receiving it in the mail  i was surprised by the quality of the dress. this dress is made very well. after trying it on it did look like i was going to be dancing with the hippies in woodstock. but i love the dress and plan on wearing it soon. good quality
The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me  i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem  it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall
Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.
I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd  5'3"  curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!
This is a lovely and unique blouse. it can be worn with jeans  shorts or a skirt. such a beautiful addition to anyone's wardrobe!
The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.
I am reasonably petite  but i like sweaters very oversized and large  so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large  the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size  the sweater ended up looking very awkward  with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do
I initially saw this top a few months ago  and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores  so i ordered it online  where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week  and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty  but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good  but when they realized they were so popular  and had more made  the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery  and ther
I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i wasn't sure the color would work on my pale skin  but wow  so pretty! it fits like s glove  in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes. the tie waist in a beautiful addition. the chest seems roomy enough  i am a 30 dd and the 0 petite fit. it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested. the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time. my only complaint is the side zipper i
I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.
This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!
I love the concept of an airy  flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however  i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.
I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy  too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.
This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big  especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night.
I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
Every year around this time  our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color  but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl  but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel
The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist  it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted  so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c  140b and got the small. fits great.
These are very pretty and comfy. the split in the leg runs a little high for me  so i will probably have to tack it. i ordered a medium (i'm 5'9" 145 lbs usually wear an 8) but these were a bit big on me  so i've reordered a small. also  the 'blue' looks more like black with tan stripes.
I'm usually a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the 2 fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black  which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.
This is a treasure and "must buy"  friends! tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts  and i feel stoked to have gotten this one. the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and well-designed. i've always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small  but  when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large  i am sooooo satisfied. this sartorial work of art is completely lovely! i have a busty f
I wanted to love these  they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the "see-through" issue that the other reviewer mentioned  my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.
Material is very thin  and although this is apparent in the design  i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times  they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6" and 130 lbs  in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect  above my knee; not too short  but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully  and i can wear it with tights and boots now  and capri tights and wedge sandals in
This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..
While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size  and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy  but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.
Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt
Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.
I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.
I love this tee!!! i bought the red  and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose  which looks great over this tee. buy it!
This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.
Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.
This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8  but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size
I was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
Love this top!!!  my summer "go to"!  fits beautifully  cool & comfortable.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was that the back layer is a little thin--i hate that.  just beef up the product  i'll spend the extra $$ to have a perfect shirt!
This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.
I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy  feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer  i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh  i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.
Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft  comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)
I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup  but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you  i think you'll love it.
A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.
I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i'm usually xs or small  and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can't compare  but the small was flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'5" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple  neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it  so it's probably not great for hot da
I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric is lovely  soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great  that is  until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine  i have a large bust  and the fabric stretched across the bust  causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.
The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer. i sent it back .
Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.
Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
This pant is beautiful and fits great except for the waist. it is too big. i carry all my extra weight in my waist too. 5' 6 1/2"  150lbs  straight and up down figure. the waist gapped in the back almost 2 inches. otherwise this is a great pant  if you have a well developed bootie  maybe they would fit. ordered a 10 by the way. if they make it to sale  will purchase again and take to tailor. they are a well constructed lovely pant.
Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4  135lbs  size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type  i'm hourglass and athletic.
I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr
I have a tough time shopping for jeans because almost everything that fits my butt is too big in the waist. also  i have thick thighs so that's an issue and i hate shopping for jeans. these are so much cuter on than on the hanger. try them. you won't regret it. so flattering.
I am in love with this dress. the colors are amazing but also is the fabric. it is soft and supple. i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust  waist  and hips. this is truly an amazing dress. you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look.
Had to have these when i saw them online. usually an ag girl  but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit. originally ordered a 28 and returned for a 27. after a couple of wears  wish i bought the 26. a must have!
This fit nicely and i loved the asymmetrical flower design. it is somewhat sheer/see through so i put a tank underneath.
I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight  gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!
I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.
I normally wear a size 2 so i ordered a small and an small petite  i will be keeping the small because the small petite looks like a shirt on me  my height is 5'4". it runs very big underneath the arms as well. the design is so unique i will be keeping it.
This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.
I have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it. it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up. super versatile!!
I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i can't wait to wear it! i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal. like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine. it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size 10 figure perfectly (i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me). the medium length was perfect for my height (5"6).
Love this top--the material is very soft and though this isn't a thick tshirt  it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely. i'm 5'7"  about 130  not busty  and got a small--fits great! the color is more of an off-rose/blush (has more of a brown tint than the photo shows).
Bought this dress for easter and the compliments were relentless. the quality of this is superior  hence the price. the fact that it can be worn year round  i will get my money's worth out of it. my only "complaint" is the belt. that little sucker was way confusing to me so i just went without it. i needed directions to figure it out or a phd. ; )
Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.
I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all  the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy  it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.
I bought this in my usual size small (i'm a 4-6  27" waist  32b)  and it fits perfectly. it's a little loose and boxy but still structured and cute (it fits me like the model). i don't find it itchy at all  and the embroidery is just gorgeous. this is perfect for transitioning from summer to fall!
I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually  i have to buy petite-sized pants  but the length fit at my ankle  and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer  i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops  but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater.
Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.
When i saw this top online i loved it  and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops  and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer  but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is  if you a little busty  the neckline might dip a tiny bit
This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10"  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.
Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch. can be dressed up or down. i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi. 5'4" 135# and the small is perfect.
I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.
Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look  so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me  but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but  it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.
Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference  i am 5'6  135lbs  34c  28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi
Love the tunic. rich color. longer than i thought. i am 5'9"  140 and it almost comes to mid thigh. also ordered medium - it is roomier than anticipated. but looks good loose and flowing. overall love the tunic  the shape  style and will have big fun wearing it.
I love   love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.
Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable  soft  stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.
I've been looking for an off the shoulder trend item and this one fits the bill perfectly. the denim is a nice color and weight  love  love the pockets! the neckline is not too frilly  the sleeves are fluttery but not over the top ruffled. i wore this dress to lunch with cute flat sandals and i must say it looked adorable! sad i didn't find this earlier in the summer  but will wear when i can. my only concern is that it will shrink in length  i'm hoping not. this one will def be taken to the dry
Absolutely love the cut and design of these pants! fit so well and unique pattern at the ankle however  as is the case with many white pants  so disappointed when i tried them on at home and could see my underwear (nude color!) the pants are beautiful in every way except that they need to be lined! going back - may order the black since they're not likely to be "see through!" disappointing! was hoping to wear them to a dinner party!
So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug  so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!
This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out  the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
While i wanted to love this dress  i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk  would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.
Lovely knit and so soft  but the bottom curls up underneath  similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too  got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!
I am super happy with this purchase. this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow. i'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it  making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather. i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well.
I purchased this in the coral color and i am very happy with it. i find it to run true to size  has a nice stretch to it  but fits close to the body. the coral is gorgeous and looks very nice with my olive skin. the only odd thing i have found is the sweater seems to have random darker fibers. i looked at all of them in this color in store and they all had some dark fibers... strange. but  i have worn a few times already and i am very happy.
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.
When i saw this online  i thought it was going to be a thin  summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy  but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too  would definitely recommend!
Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose  these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .
This product is made of good-quality cotton material. it does run a little large  but it still fits nicely. i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment.
This is a lovely dress  a bit brighter in person. i took off one star because only the bodice is lined. at this price point the dress should be fully lined
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.
Great shirt!! i bought the red penguins and its adorable. i am returning it however b/c the size i bought was too big  with that said it was my error not the brand. i think it runs true to size.
I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it's going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it's high quality. just wish the fit was better.
I ordered the taupe version of this tee  which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough  and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit  which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture  i expected an a-line fit  but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes  and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
Shirt looks nice standing straight but did not work if i cross my arms.  i felt that i could have superman'd out if that.  i would have gone for a larger size of it was available  but sadly not.
I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. i'm between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six  but it's definitely tight. i have a larger chest  and it's pretty low and sexy  though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. i've also put shirts under it and it's a super cute jumper. i'm 5'1 and the dress (regular  not petite) hits right below my knee.
I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it's going back.
I love this dress! i spotted it in the store yesterday right before walking out. i almost missed it! i'm so glad that i didn't because this dress is super cute. the fit is nice too. not too short. the fringe detailing is very cool. i cannot wait to wear this dress this spring/summer. casual enough for flip flops  but could also be dressed up with some cute wedge sandals.
The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
I bought a pair in both black and green. i sized up one size because of previous reviews. i am happy with the fit. they are very comfortable  look good and keep their shape. the only negatives are after two washings  (following the directions-cold water  no dryer)  the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached. overall  i would still recommend them.
When this dress first showed up online  i liked it  but didn't buy it because i wasn't in love. retailer weekend popped up  so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first "off the shoulder" dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up  no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy.
I love the pants and it's so soft and they're great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that's super disappointing but i'm hoping it was just bad luck ;(
Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.
Love the design and the gold color  but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
I'm 5'7"  125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately  they were a little too small  particularly around my butt. after i ordered them  i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up  as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered  but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better  because this suit is ador
This dress is stunning. i loved the cut and seam detailing. it is very flattering...if it fits. i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size 10/12. i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs  back and tummy. i bought the large and it doesn't' come in a bigger size :( it is very well made and completely lines. i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you.
Love these! i'm about 5'4  and they fit right at the ankle. the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans. i've worn them several times  and they haven't stretched out at all. perfect for spring.
Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique  it's very "floaty" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals.   the "empire" does hit across the breast line  not below. i thought it added to the different shape  & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.
Soft  comfy  great fit. this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter. looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly. the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terry/jersey material. i'm usually a medium and the medium fit great. slimming lines and does a great job of being swingy/flared  without that tent look.
This dress looks lovely on the model  but it looks just awful on me! i am 5'4" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve  it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space. the material is nice and the sequins are pretty  but the cut of the dress is unflattering.
I ordered the black and white version online  and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured  heavier cloth  and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress  and i would highly recommend it!
I wanted to love it - the color is great  the embroidery pretty  but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.
The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest  jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit  can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.
I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin
Beautiful skirt with a fun  graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back  plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2" and often need to wear petite  but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!
Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!
The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really  really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn't enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it.
This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit  however  the sleeves were too long. had to return  as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
This is a lovely  well-made piece by maeve  a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle  colors are vibrant  and design of the dress is cute  if a bit on the short side.    however  i  like some of the other reviewers  didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with
This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler (colder!) months piece.     colors   the colors are muted  the pattern is modern and stylish  the cut flattering.     sizing  the sizing is generous  and fit is easy. love length  which is true to the product photo- fitting at about the bottom of my fingertips. i love the coverage without looking too covered.    quality   it's soft  a great weight ---and the quality seems good. i have already worn it a few times and it is not one of those sweaters
Missed these last year in black  so snatched them up when i saw them this season! great versatile wardrobe piece - dress them up or down with knee-hi boots  booties  or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater. love something that i can wear so many ways  and look and feel polished and put together.
I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand  but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft  light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring  winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size  i am 36d  31" waist and 5' 2" so i ordered a large and it fi
Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.
This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy  i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist  i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty
So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color  but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.
This top may be right for some  but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however  it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl  but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big.     the quality is great and style so pretty  though. i wish it had worked for me!
I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy  but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape)  and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary  but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size  which helped  and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant  and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath  just bare skin   but they're so small that i don
I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well  more so in dresses than tops. also  it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity  but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also  the length is nice  close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr
This is really cute online  but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder  but the material is very thin  and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.
I ordered this dress the instant it appeared online  hoping that 'tangerine' would mean red  and not orange. and  what luck! it was the perfect red for my coloring - nothing orange or bricky  it was a true red. the background color is actually a deep navy  but it looks almost black in some angles. the fabric is super comfortable. it's long enough for work  easy and fun enough for a date  and perfect for spring-summer months.     my only problem with it is the top is too large. i am a 34-a  5ft-3
This is a cute somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen  ties on the sides  and a zipper down the back. it'll go great with pants or skirts. the fit  though  is huge-- i'm normally an 8  but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says "dry clean." if it doesn't say "dry clean only " you can wash it.
I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length.   i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!
Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.
I purchased this sweater in the grey color and loved it so much i decided to buy it in purple as well. however  when i received it  the color was much much darker than pictured and even looked black sometimes. decided to return :/
This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
I love the unique style of this dress. the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details. as for fit ... i'm a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee.
I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes  this is a cute shirt  if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but  my arms aren't even big  and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(
I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months  or layer it with a sweater  thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style)  but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4  which fit me perfectly. it's nice that
These run really small..almost 2 sizes up. so if you order these  i would order a few sizes to cover your basis. otherwise  good quality  good coverage. hopefully sizing up will fit me.
I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot  hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich  vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.
I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews  i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately  it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest  and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.
I read the earlier reviews on this  and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is  i love it! it is so adorable and comfortable. i bought the petite s  and i am 5'2"  118 lbs. it fit true to size in the shoulders. the petite hits just a few inches below my waist  so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short. the sweater part is soft  not itchy  and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well. because this is very
This skirt is super cute and a great easy skirt to wear with basically anything. but what is truly remarkable is the softness off its fabric. i found it in the store and wasn't sure i needed it but it felt so good i could not put it down!
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
This jacket is the best. i'm trying to step up my work wardrobe game while still maintaining some personality and this blazer fits the bill. it's soft  structured  and best part: the hoodie insert is removable. for reference  i'm 5'4"  128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.
I love this cardigan  it is very soft  and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite  however. added this one to my wish list :-)  soft  versatile.
The sweater looks cute if you get the right size. it meant to look a little oversized  i think. the color is pretty in person  however it looks different online and in person so keep that in mind. the material is very warm and a little itchy you will need to wear it over a long sleeve undershirt. the look is nice but it is for a cold day.
Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition.
This top is super cute and comfy! just wish they would have made more xl's - ran out fast! i am 5'10 and usually wear an 8-10 top in retailer  so i purchased a large in this top to get the length and look of the model in the picture. it was too short and didn't fall like the picture  i tried to exchange for the xl and it was already sold out! bummer! was looking forward to wearing this all summer! 4 stars for running out of a size so quickly! please make more!!
This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!
I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel  this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes  i would order down.
I have been looking for a nice  white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.
Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however  i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips  smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still  i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c)  but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very "busty". i tried it on at the store  and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple  which i prefer.     the buttons are beautiful  but i couldn't see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them  since they don't slide out of the buttonholes easily. but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe
I really wanted this dress to work out  but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6  however  my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(
I'm 5'10" and have athletic legs. these jeans are so comfy  long enough  and look good on the booty. the photo is deceiving as they are much longer. i wish they carried more colors. it's hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these.
I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.
I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality
This trench is beautiful  with a lovely  swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement - you'll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie. i wish i could have kept it  but i couldn't justify paying full price on a coat that had to be hand-washed (the label specifies no dry cleaning!).there is a lot of fabric on this trench  and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too. i don't have the time for that  and for this much money  i wou
This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also  i am between a size small and medium  i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big  so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a
Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy  doesn't need to be ironed really  substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i'm rarely a 2 at retailer  but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i'm usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this.
I absolutely love this top! it is soft  comfortable and perfectly flowy. this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top.
I was so excited to try this dress  but after ready the reviews i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6"   134 lbs  and wear a size 6. well  it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however  i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr
Loved the fit of these jeans and the fading but the ripping was too much for me at my age. i normally wear petite but since these are mid rise ankle just ordered in 27 regular. so the ripping was right at my knee and did not like that.
Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs  curvy.
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.
Wonderful fabric  drapes nicely from waist= flattering  use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight  patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual
This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily  when i wore it  i ended up with several tears in the threads  leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings  my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad  and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn  simply because it would last a lot longer.
As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
In the words of my husband  "looks like you're wearing a bag." i'm althetic and short. maybe this works best on tall and very slim?
Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
I purchased this  and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green  and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall  unimpressed.
I am an retailer employee  i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite  and it fits perfect  except the inside l
Such a cute jean! got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle (and price)! also love the shade of gray i bought.
This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha
I get that it's a swing tank  and it's supposed to be loose but i got a 00p and it's huge! too much material. with that being said  it's such a cute top that i decided to keep it. i got it taken in about 2 inches on each side and it now looks great.
I saw this in-store  tried it on  and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite  105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.
This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric  not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off  as i fix  one shoulder  another will slide down. the material is nice but since it is not lined  it feels inexpensive  disposable.
I love this skirt - fits great  snug but comfortable and the length is perfect for wearing with ankle strap sandals. the material is soft and hangs nicely. my new favorite skirt. i am 5'8 and curvy - got the large  which was perfect for my fuller figure.
I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway  i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs  5'1.5") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft  nad looks like it may not wrinkles  which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute  but you can't really wear this untied  so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)
I liked this top (in black)  but it didn't fit me well. had to return.
I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.
I have a narrow face  and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.
I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too "flowy".
I'm 5"0" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide  and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also  not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.
I oot this dress in the blue. it fits great--hits at the knee  not too short or awkwardly long. i just wish they had it in short sleeve so i could wear one for the summer. beautiful and easy to wear for work or fun.
I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale  but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well. it's a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time. it looks about the same as it does on the model color/fit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar  which makes it more interesting. i'm 6ft tall 160lb  ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized  but with tha
I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall
Fits true to size. very feminine. it's great with skinny jeans. not quite the length of tunic
I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear. but  i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale. i don't have an occasion to wear it yet but i can't wait! the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful. the only thing i'm worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill. it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully.
This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a 4 or 6 and the 6p fits well  not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger  i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size.     the dress is risquã© because it's faux "see through" but still very classy and elegant. it's sexy w
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
I ordered my usually size  xs  and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.
Love this versatile cardigan  have both blue & orange colors & they're beautiful. it's light weight yet cozy. true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up.
I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a
I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering  soft  and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit  also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible  the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40"  bust x 33" waist.
Comfortable  flattering  one step up in formality from jammies  what more could you want?
I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.
These pants are a must for any girl's summer warm weather wardrobe! i tried them on in the store and loved them. but... i am just over 5' and they were too long in the xs  even with 2.5 inch heels. so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my 2.5-3 inch heels.   i love that they are wide-legged! they look cool and are flattering! i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace. and of course  heels. i highl
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(
I expected better from this top  it is thin  will snack easy  and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price  not worth it. definitely returned!
Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.
I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all  it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one.     the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.
As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.
I wanted to love this top. perfect weight  length  and shape. unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you.
Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts  36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however  i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn)  2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look  and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me  it wasn
This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big  but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly  it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big  as is often the case
I took a chance buying online. i'm thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.
I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday  i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly.     i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely
Hangs terribly off the chest. tent-like. looks maternity. no thanks.
These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
I bought a size small (5'6" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking "hippy" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area.
I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.
This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue)  but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).
Buttons were broken off when i opened the package  stretchy at waist  not good quality for the price.
But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off  but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...    firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr
I would have l loved to keep it but even the 0p was big. i have pretty broad muscular shoulders and back and i was swimming it. i wish retailer would stock more petites. i would repurchase if the 00p was available.  they always sell out very very quickly and they never restock.
I love the weight of this dress  the mod color blocking  the pockets  the detail down the side of the skirt  the cable knit  everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties  it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up  especially for this price.
Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i've also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites.
It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?
This top looked so cute on! i loved the color and the way it looked on my body. as cute as this looked tied  it could also be worn open as well with a tank top. loved it!
Yes  it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique  chic and modern. definitely worth the price  especially on sale. very nice quality fabric.
It's just not for me and i really like it. it's made very well and it looks great from the front. not so much from the side. i'm a 36c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chest...so much that i will be returning it. i look like i have an extra 20 lbs. on me.
I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress  and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me)  the straps are almost tight  so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful  i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich  and classy  the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.    115 lbsm 30d
I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately  the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown  you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i
Ok  the material is great  light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo  that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem  the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets  on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f
Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6" the dress (size small)  hits right above my knees. very versatile dress  may be dressed up or down depending on shoes
It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however
Ok...so after reading the other reviews  i'm sad to say i rated this as "runs small" only because i usually buy one or two sizes smaller in maeve than i settled on with this dress. it's actually an adorable dress but i'm sure you have to have the right figure. i don't think any one woman has the same figure as another and this dress is made for someone with a very definite hourglass figure. i have a large chest  a moderate middle and large hips. i really loved both sizes but i chose to size up b
I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6" these are a miss for me!
I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same  boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large  so size down (i am 5'4"  125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body  even though i generally wear things large). also  the collar was a hemmed flat collar  not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why  and the tiger embellishments were more orange  yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered.
I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
Ordered online  and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9  130. the embroidery is lovely  but the style doesn't work. i had a small  but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame  but i do caution how "voluminous" the cut
This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!
I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
When i tried this top on  i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea  wrong material and placement.
This is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front. gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking. however  if you have "shapely" hips and back-side  this will definitely emphasize that. had to take it back. a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events. however  if you're less endowed in that area  it might work well. gives a great shape!
I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
I've worn this twice now and got a ton of compliments on it. it's so comfortable and looks great. the lavender color is gorgeous. highly recommend.
These are the perfect high-waisted skinny jeans. they fit tts and don't stretch out. are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots. i adore them!
Easter ??mother's day tea??baby shower??  i'm 5'2" 120# and ordered a 4p. true to size. beautifully made  flowy  feminine. i can't wait to wear this!
I really wanted to not like the top for that price  but ti looks really good  the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p  not sure what size to get  and it is just fine. the length is almost too short  but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide  like poofing out a bit  perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer  but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also  teh colla
I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however  this was really tight. also  the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
The suit is beautiful  however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight  to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing  i ordered a medium  i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than "full coverage". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa
I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large  i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall
I like this on the model so i ordered it. it is not quite as deep in color as online but still pretty. it fits well not too loose and not tight at all. i will get great use out of this all the way through spring!
I am 5'6"  130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.
Just a ginormous  shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!
I purchased this dress in "yellow" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes  and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length  hitting just below my knees  and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person  but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!
These jeans fit great  but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on  they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size  i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the "legging" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model  but i'm 5'5" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model.
I tried on areturn at my store  size 26 (i am often a 25 in jeans) - because these are tighter fit  teh 26 was fine. length was long though  but fit comfortably and looked nice. the cutout was at my knee  which bothered me a tad (model  seems a bit above the knee). i decided not to purchase them as i found another pair i liekd better  but if you are taller and are looking for a distressed skinny  these are great. (i am 115 lbs and have thighs ad butt form working out)
I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty
This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said  it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style  so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.
These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down  in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last 2 yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on  they stretched out so much it was annoying.   these script jeans are amazing  flattering and are a nice lightweight denim. i wore them a few times before washing and
I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have
I bought each color in three different sizes because the one i want was sold out. the lavender tile motif is the one i got in my ideal size medium petite and it fits the best. what i don't like is that the inside of the skirt is white  which features prominently because of the high side slits. makes the dress look low quality. my favorite dresses were the solid teal and solid black. however the small was too small on my bust and the large petite was too large on my bust. i'm wondering if wash th
This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play  can't wait to pair with booties into fall.
This top is cute  but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs  but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2"  110 lbs  34a). even worse  though  was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined  so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy  and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt  but not worth actually wearing.
Hi  i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.
This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.
I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame.
I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26  and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut  color  fabric and distressing are great. i am 5'3" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall  i love these jeans and wear them a lot!
Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2" about 110 pounds and not flat chested.
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however  i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim  5'9" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly  this one went back....
The color  design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large.   bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s
I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip  however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.
Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.
I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.
Casual dinner out dress love the color  mine is navy.
I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low  this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat
This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it  i will be returning it because it was a little short.
Again  nope. looks chic on the model  looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in "a christmas carol." i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was "shmata" (yiddish for "rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe
Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!
The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.
Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.
I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however  the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly  but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price  i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous  so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .
I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t
Beautiful dress appears well-made  but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.
Okay i'm short  so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty  but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!
This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on  all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed  i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.
My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work.
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
If you have muscular thighs  like me  these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed  i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.
I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy  but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement  but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious.
This top is so pretty. i would say it's probably  about 1 size smaller than normal  but i like the cropped fit.
I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did)  how  uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful  but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train  which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too  yes  a tiny bit of shimmer :-)
I love this cardigan. i purchased it in the cream color. however  it did fray a bit after washing it. other than that  i think it was a great buy though!
Really enjoy this pullover's arm detail. i got the "purple" which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet. i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirt/jeans.
This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9  145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s  m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.
I bought 3 of these tops in different colors  the blue one had one sleeve noticeably shorter. sent it back. now less than 10 days later they are on sale. the style is darling and get many complements on the two i have. fyi i'm a 36d 130lbs and med fit great
It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.
I really love this shirt - fits just like the picture shows and runs tts. the color is a beautiful red - a bitter richer/darker in person than it looks online.
This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap  rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.
I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.
I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs
I love this dress  although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person  it's a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesn't feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however  the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it's a bit strange looking.
Tried the blue motif  size 6  regular.  i'm 5'6" and if i were shorter i'd go with petite sizing.  stats: 34a-28-36 with broad shoulders  sometimes i go up to a size 8 in blazers but this was a perfect fit. side pockets  dress is unlined and quite lightweight. the tie has to be tied in back and i liked the clean lines this gives in front. nice and simple for when it warms up!
This too is great to throw on when running to class or going out. love the two different materials and the back detail.
I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.
I don't normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give  feeling like it will stretch out  and being slightly see-through  it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!
I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
This shirt runs large  so order down a size. it is comfortable  cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono  vest  pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on  than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!
The denim is soft and very comfortable  the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans  and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.
The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.
Was enchanted by this dress from the moment i saw it online. i was able to find it at my local retailer
This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the "one size" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.
This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!
I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.
Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb  34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect  the top is huge  especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however  the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.
Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it "gaps" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom
Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts  but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.
I am a 4  so i ordered the s. slipped these pants on and i couldn't get them zipped up. i thought perhaps i ordered a 0  nope  a s. i'm not even sure a m would fit! these unfortunately are going back tomorrow. the material and color were beautiful (bronze)  but the sizing is very strange!
Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!
Didn't love it  didn't hate  rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.  i'm 5'4"  123lbs  34a  the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink  if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s.
I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.
It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
This looks awesome with leggings / jeggings and booties or slip ons. great buy. its a wee big  but there are slits up the sides pretty high.
I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i
I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee  so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves  a slub texture  super soft  awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly  the black was not even close to a favorite  but t
I love this shirt  very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest  so i returned for the next size up.  very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.
I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"  145 lbs  34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an
I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online).    it is very cute but definitely runs large.
The fabric  colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy! i am 5' 9" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!
So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red  size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.
I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great  and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs  which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m  but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips  fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically  if you're deliberating between s and m for this top  get
Love the way this dress looks online. sadly  it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4"  athletic build. the small fit perfectly  but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me  but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off.
I'm 5'6" about 120 and usually a 0/2 in retailer... the size 2 in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably. on the hanger and from the photo i didn't think i'd like it  but once on it's really pretty and the fabric looks so nice  it has great movement  and is really flattering.
I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.
This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.
Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
It was the color that prompted me to take this dress to the fitting room. as seen in the photos  it is a deep burgundy or dark maroon. though the color is deep and rich  the design of the dress makes it lighter and easily able to be worn during the heat of the summer.     in the later months of summer and early fall  i will wear this dress without leggings for a transitional look. when the temps cool down  though  i will wear leggings or tights throughout the winter with the dress. it will easil
I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.
I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events. i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look. i am only 5'4'' and it hit above my knees. it's a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear. love it!
I love the 2 straps details  funny thing though is thsi bra is giving me rounder boobs... a little cleavage  nto waht i am sued to with a sports bra. lvoe the color (ordered the purple).
As a beach cover-up this would be great  but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
I love this top!! i got lucky and found it returned at a store (always always check the "found and collected racks ladies!) it was a 6 and i was a little worried it would be much to large  but it fit great! i like that i can wear something under it or on its own. i didn't fit it too short  but i'm a little under 5'7" and roughly 127 lbs  32/34a. highly recommend!
I'm 5 4"  135 lbs. i got the petite xs (normally would be petite small) and love the fit. it's soft weave and the length exudes the feeling of comfort and warmth.
This is such a lovely top  but so very big and billowy. makes me wish i were taller  then i think it could work. there is just too much extra fabric all around. so sad because it seems well made  and is very beautiful. too bad it doesn't come in petites or even an xxs. even with my hips  it was just too much.
I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium  am 5'7"  150 lbs  really am large boned  straight up and down.
The back of this dress is stunning. i am usually a petite but could get away with regular. tried on xs (115 lbs  30dd chest) and it was good length and not too low cut. colors are really fun  the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines. flory and airy.
I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but  just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!
Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them  but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!
Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater  if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5'7  34c  and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer!
I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.
This pants the worst short that i ever had!!  i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!  i was really shock definetly will return it to store.  fyi  i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.
I'm torn on how to review this dress.     i bought it in a lovely slate grey (which doesn't appear to be available now). it drapes cleanly and is extremely comfortable. it has also proven extremely versatile through weight and body changes. i bought a small and am 5'9"  and am typically ~130 lbs with a very long waist. i wore it through early pregnancy and now love it because i can nurse my newborn comfortably and it still nicely fits my ~150 lb frame.     the problem is that my husband hates th
Purchased it in raspberry. first time it came in the mail  it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud! come on customer service  you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them! i ordered it again  and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic  so pristine.   i am a size 8-10  and the small fit me fine. the lining is a little tight in the crotch area  but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit!!
This is a cute shirt  but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular "flap." it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.
I'm 5'3" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well  but this one was weirdly big at the top
I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.
I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go
I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice  soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front  but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit.   the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional  b
I want to love this dress. it's cute and fits well...except that the hem has been taken out! it looks like it had a hem that was removed  and they left the crease remnant and frayed edge. looks very sloppy on the bottom. to keep this dress  i would have to pay a seamstress to hem it  and i don't want to pay extra money for something that should already be done.
Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting  but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.
I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little "stiffness" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!
I am mad for plaid--this dress is my new favorite!! why? i'll tell you!! the picture online does not do it justice  but you must add a belt. the dress is cut lower in the front  but has a great stitch to keep it from gaping open over my d cup chest. the material is soft and breathable. the xsp was perfect for my 5'2" frame  my typical size.
The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee.   regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"  36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi
I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if
Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four  i am moderately short waisted.
I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
The dress is beautiful in pictures  but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly  had to return.
I love this skirt  in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however  being suede  the skirt was very bulky. also  at 5'8" and liking skirts to be long enough for work  i typically don't have problems with long length. however  i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they'll make some updates in future styles.
This top is lovely to look at and to wear... one to reach for frequently
This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting  feminine  and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise  which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite  the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you  retailer  for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.
I may regret returning this sweater  because it would be lovely had i been able to wear it as i was when i ordered it. as i am in a wheelchair temporarily  i find the sweater too bulky in a sitting position. if you are slender and are looking for vertical lines that are slimming in a style so fashionable now  this is the sweater for you! the neutral colors and the bulky weave i also love because it goes with everything--a go-to sweater-coat.
I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived  i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store!
Lovely dress  but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do.
This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great.     i'm 5"7  120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s  so i went with the s.
Even on my 5'1"  short-waisted  100 lb body  this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.
I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it's sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it!
In person the colors are prettier and it's more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it's too big:(
This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way  especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous  especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry
1. i'm 5'5" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.  2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos  but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.  3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all.
Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.
This top is gorgeous in person  but when i tried it on  i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately  but the more i wore it around the fitting room area  the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8"  140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes  it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.
As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it. like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath. it does run large but that's my style. i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties. can be dressed up or down. highly recommend :)
I love the look of this right away. i found it ran small to retailer's clothes (where i'm inexplicably a xs or s here i was a m). i also am a dd  so would have appreciated more support  but as the other reviewer  i can get away with it to wear this cute suit.
I went to the store to buy the transcend verdugo ankle in blue. however i left with it in blue and black. the black is perfect. absolutely amazing fabric that shapes your behind  and no ones is more imperfect than mine. i cant say enough about these except paige rocks! i'm a fan!!
I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality  like as shown. i am 5'4"  120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews  but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust.
I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly! it's gorgeous in person  and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer.
This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace  substantial fabric  great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders  and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model  they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned  the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4"  120 lbs  and tried a size s.
This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck  but i assume that will get easier with time.
I got this tank because it was on sale  thinking it could be cute  but i didn't have high hopes. once i put it on  i loved it. i have a long torso and it's the perfect length. i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather.
I was so excited to wear this shirt  even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot  and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.
The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.
Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.
The colors on this top are beautiful  even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work  back it goes.
This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.  very figure flattering
I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors  it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.
I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these  either. i have slim legs- if you don't  i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.
I love the style of this top  and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty  and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes  unfortunately they cut the armholes really big  so when you put your arms forward  the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway  but for $98 dollars i thin
Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.
Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.
The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.
I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 102 lbs. 32c
This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.
This coat is so beautiful! like others i wouldn't have even considered it online but i tried it on in the store and absolutely fell in love with. it is the softest material ever and is so flattering on.
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...
I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer  so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately  i did not like the swing dress cut  especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown  but either way it was not working for me. to be fair  swing dr
I really wanted this to work. alas  it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up  and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up  but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.
The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips  emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall  the pants were a miss.
Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
I agree with the other reviewer  this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.    ___________  pros:  - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend  making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.  - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.  - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.  - ran tts. i'm 5'9  hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.  ___________  cons:
Adorable  well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however  it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!
I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color  i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however  once i saw this dress in-store  i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made  the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it
I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.
The sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back.
I bought the petite and my only wish  oddly enough  is that the length at the bottom was 3 inches longer! as a petite  this dress his just before the knee and should be mid calf as shown in the picture. however  the design is exceptional and i will wear this all year from sandals to ballet flats to boots.
Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!
I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background  the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium  which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can  especially for women with a larger bust. th
These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for  but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!
Picked this up on sale - was on the fence about the bright reddish/orange coloration  but it really says summer and goes so easily with multiple summer pieces. it is generously cut and made very well. i've worn it on cooler/rainy days and it really brightens everything up. best part is that it launders well too.
This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.
I purchased this dress for my 50th birthday bash!!! it was stunning!!! the fit was perfect. i did buy it a size up  but could have worn my regular size. it is incredibly flattering and elegant. very well made. one of my go to black dresses for the summer!!!
Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose  relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me  but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture  great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!
This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.
I'm a maeve fan and i really like the design  fabric and details of this dress. unfortunately  the skirt flares out too much and ends in an odd area on my legs. i'm not sure why the silhouette doesn't drape on me as it does on the model. it's like a cut-off a-line flare. have to agree that this dress runs large. i usually wear a m  ordered the s and it's still too big.
I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the "laid flat width" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the
This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person.
This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t
I wasn't able to purchase this item because i just couldn't get the size right in the bust. the small puckered at the bust and i swam in the medium. bummed because the colors are so vibrant and pretty and the length and flow were great!
Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture  definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
This dress is beautiful! it is a nice  heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.
There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that  i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front  while very cute  gave
I read other reviews that there was extra fabric in the stomach area and knew it'd be perfect for me to wear to a wedding at 20 weeks pregnant. and it was! i got tons of compliments. it accented my baby bump perfectly  fitted but not too tight.  the pleats at the top create a nice shape for the bump. very comfortable for an outdoor wedding. my only complaint is that the armholes are rather tight. after pregnancy i will try belting the dress.
I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said  a medium would fit better and would not be so wide  but i fe
I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"  112lbs...with a small frame.
The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great
I couldn't resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest. i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly. the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints. i love the longer cut since i'm 5-10 and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge. the blue is darker than the online picture shows and i'll probably be going back for that but at almost $100 i'm hoping it'll go on sale.
I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so  i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.
This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.
It is a really cute sweater. i thought it would be a little longer based on the picture. on me it hits at my waist but i am still okay with it. the design is unique and i am happy with the purchase.
I love this tunic. i am 22 weeks pregnant and the large fit great. i wish it were a little longer but will be great with leggings and perfect for the fall/winter seasons.
This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot)  so i would have liked to size down; however  the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms  maybe you could size down and make this work.
Had my doubts and ordered on sale just to try. am amazed how often i have worn this jacket!! goes with a lot of pants and skirts. great buy on sale. am 5' 6 1/2" 150lbs and medium is perfect..
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
Loving the ombrã© color combination  the smooth lining  the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass  stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted  size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top  i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want  do try it on in person.
This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.
What a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2  105lbs  and ordered the xxs petite.
I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however  the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"  125#  34c)  but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally  the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l
I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.
I ordered these in both the grey and moss  and i love both. they are very soft  very easy  loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured  so they hit lower on my leg than on the model  which i prefer in these. i am 5'3  105 lbs  ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile  like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine  cold  laid flat to dry)  touched up with light steam from
This is a cute dress  but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small  2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame  this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller  thinner people. unfortunately  mine is going back.
I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.
Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.
I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however  the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.     sadly  dress had to be returned.
Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties!   here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button  however the button is very low. therefore  the sleeve rolls up not mid arm  but actually about three inches above my wrist! (it's still super cute  just nowhere near my elbow. just letting you know).  final detail that
This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on
This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!
I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though  so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.
I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh
I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.
I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.
I love the design of this tunic. it is sewn well  but the fabric is cheap. i disliked the texture of the fabric so much that i returned it.
The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately  the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
