Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,0,Shorts
I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.,0,Jeans
"First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5"" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price.",0,Knits
"I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2""  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.",0,Knits
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,0,Intimates
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,0,Dresses
Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.,0,Blouses
After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!,0,Blouses
"The style of this dress is quite lovely  i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store  however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure  i should mention that i am 5'9"" and have an athletic figure but with hips.   the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the",0,Dresses
The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric,0,Knits
The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.,0,Jeans
While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.,0,Jeans
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.,0,Knits
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.,0,Blouses
I wanted to love this dress so much! but unfortunately it fell a little short of my expectations. the overall quality of the dress is great! it's very light  flowy  and super comfortable to wear. i just wish it was a bit more flattering. i debated on returning it since it didn't really give me any shape but the material was so darn comfortable and such an easy outfit to thrown on that i couldn't part with it.,0,Dresses
I really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.,0,Dresses
Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!,0,Pants
I loved the lines in this jacket  but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.,0,Sweaters
This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.,0,Dresses
I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re,0,Dresses
I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.,0,Jeans
True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment  or spot clean at best.,0,Blouses
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.",0,Pants
I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th,0,Fine gauge

Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.,0,Dresses
This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.,0,Dresses
I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.,0,Dresses
May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.,0,Dresses
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,0,Outerwear
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.,0,Dresses
I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on,0,Dresses
I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite  sadly when it arrived and i tried it on  it was very boxy  stiff like  and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.,0,Sweaters
Dress looks beautiful  but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly  but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4  the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p  i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like  it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also  this dress is very stiff  can't d,0,Dresses
Stretch out fast    5 8 130lb i order size 26 which is my usually size. they fit prefect for about 3hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body. maybe i should have gone down a  sizes. even so i feel like the $$$ and quality don't add up but they are very soft and comfortable  i wouldn't buy them again.,0,Jeans
The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.,0,Dresses
I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per,0,Dresses

First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second  i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it  but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa,0,Sleep
"First off  the dress quality is great  the fabric is very nice  the color is great. i am 5'4""  150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me  very unattractive  because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant.",0,Dresses
So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.,0,Lounge
"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4""  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online.",0,Trend
"I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.",0,Fine gauge
Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute  someone had clearly bought this  worn it  and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!,0,Dresses
I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,0,Swim

I had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well  and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.,0,Knits
This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.,0,Sweaters
The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big  it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics  not sure if it is because it's new.,0,Knits
I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.,0,Blouses
"I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are",0,Shorts
This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.,0,Blouses

These were very nice  but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist ,0,Jeans
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses
Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns  the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed.,0,Blouses
This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.,0,Fine gauge
"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2""  115lbs  32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it  o well.",0,Fine gauge

I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea  but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model  so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me  because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful  the pink is more a blush and washed me out  the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t,0,Knits
I had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online. however  it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris. for the price  the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.,0,Blouses
Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!,0,Blouses
Very high quality dress. there are two layers  (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight  making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.,0,Dresses
Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.,0,Blouses
This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,0,Blouses
I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.,0,Blouses
I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,0,Jackets

I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,0,Legwear
I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..,0,Knits
This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however  the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.,0,Sweaters
This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material  maybe washing them would help  but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.,0,Knits

While i wanted to love this dress  i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk  would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.,0,Dresses
Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines,0,Sweaters

I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.,0,Dresses

I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.,0,Knits

I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.,0,Skirts
When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...,0,Knits
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0,Intimates

This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.,0,Knits
Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit  but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall  winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f,0,Dresses
These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.,0,Jeans
I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.,0,Dresses
So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight  the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue)  the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately  i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g)  so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular  which hopefully will have a little more room  but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!,0,Dresses
This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition  the bow seemed to be too t,0,Blouses
When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.,0,Dresses
The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.,0,Knits
I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.,0,Sweaters

This dress fits awfully. it's not short  as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've  also  felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it  potentially  may look okay on someone who is very tall  skinny  and lanky  but i have my doubts about that too.,0,Dresses

Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!,0,Jackets

They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p,0,Jeans

I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.,0,Blouses
I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.,0,Pants
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it,0,Knits
I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,0,Dresses

I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.,0,Dresses
I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex,0,Knits

I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.,0,Dresses

I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup  beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs  but it does not. unfortunately  this one is,0,Knits

So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have,0,Blouses

These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.,0,Pants

Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.,0,Knits
This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi,0,Sweaters

Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.,0,Dresses
I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.,0,Dresses

This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,0,Jackets
This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses
The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.,0,Dresses

Contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on  it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l,0,Dresses

I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,0,Jackets

Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.,0,Jeans
I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version  but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale.     i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.,0,Dresses
What a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2  105lbs  and ordered the xxs petite.,0,Dresses

I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.,0,Blouses
I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.,0,Dresses

First of all  the label on this dress is maeve  not nue by shani. second  i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny  which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall  i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.,0,Dresses
Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,0,Shorts

The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts

I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.,0,Knits

This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0,Blouses
This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,0,Dresses
I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.,0,Knits

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend

Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.,0,Skirts
Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits
I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!,0,Blouses

These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!,0,Jeans

I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.,0,Sweaters

This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,0,Jackets

This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist,0,Dresses

I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.,0,Dresses

I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.,0,Dresses

I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!,0,Dresses

Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,0,Sleep

The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders,0,Knits

I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.,0,Knits

This dress is elegant and really lovely. it looks like a throwback to the 20s and 30s. it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types. and this is why i am recommending it. but be warned: it runs large.  the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at all--it is completely sheer. for example  i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric  which is not the look i'm going for. this might be a deal breaker for some. for me  i,0,Dresses

This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.,0,Knits

So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!,0,Dresses
I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.,0,Dresses
I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.,0,Sweaters
This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.,0,Knits

Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0,Knits

Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is  however  not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd  the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted  it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked  as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!,0,Dresses

Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,0,Dresses
This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.,0,Dresses

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses

I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot,0,Dresses

Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.,0,Blouses

The blue has three colors of stripes: blue  white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model  not tight but form fitting.,0,Knits
Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms.

I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but  i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim  this may work well  but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de,0,Sweaters
This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.,0,Blouses
As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.,0,Dresses

This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.,0,Sweaters
I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!,0,Knits
I ordered the taupe version of this tee  which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough  and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit  which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture  i expected an a-line fit  but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes  and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro,0,Knits

Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured  which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips  so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure  but wasn't amazing for me.,0,Blouses

At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.,0,Knits
Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,0,Jeans
I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,0,Shorts

The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought,0,Sweaters

"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",0,Dresses
Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,0,Sweaters
I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be,0,Dresses
I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,0,Dresses
"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",0,Blouses
Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also  as has happened to me before  retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.,0,Dresses
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6"" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",0,Knits
I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.,0,Blouses

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!,0,Dresses

I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.,0,Fine gauge
I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.,0,Dresses
This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits
I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.,0,Skirts
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.,0,Sweaters

I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.,0,Dresses

It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,0,Jackets

This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom  is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight  which is what attracted me to it  but when i put it on  i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i,0,Dresses

These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,0,Sleep

In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th,0,Dresses

This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.,0,Swim

This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.,0,Knits

The color  design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large.   bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s,0,Knits
This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,0,Jackets
This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.,0,Skirts

I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped  i pounced on the black. sadly  it did nothing for me. i'm a large  sometimes medium  but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price  but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back  uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.,0,Blouses
I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.,0,Blouses

This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?,0,Outerwear

This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.,0,Dresses

This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.,0,Dresses
This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on  but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress  but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.,0,Dresses

This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.,0,Dresses

I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,0,Jeans

This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,0,Jackets
While there is nothing wrong with this top  it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store  maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much  especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.,0,Blouses

I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i'll still need to return this top.,0,Knits
I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!,0,Blouses

This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders,0,Blouses

This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off  as i fix  one shoulder  another will slide down. the material is nice but since it is not lined  it feels inexpensive  disposable.,0,Dresses
I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy.,0,Knits

The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.,0,Skirts

I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.,0,Knits

Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.,0,Dresses
The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.,0,Dresses

I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.,0,Knits

I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they,0,Dresses

I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!,0,Outerwear
What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.,0,Sweaters
While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.,0,Lounge
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,0,Blouses

I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.,0,Blouses
Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.,0,Sweaters
I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,0,Dresses
Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.,0,Blouses

Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,0,Skirts

This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.,0,Blouses

A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,0,Fine gauge

Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,0,Blouses

I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!,0,Dresses

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,0,Jeans

Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.,0,Dresses
I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.,0,Blouses

First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,0,Fine gauge

This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7)  it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.,0,Knits

I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.,0,Fine gauge
The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo,0,Blouses

I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.,0,Dresses
Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat  even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!,0,Dresses
It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.,0,Blouses

For starters  the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top  but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top  the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.,0,Blouses

I ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great  either. big and boxy. it could acco,0,Dresses

I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.,0,Knits

I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,0,Blouses

I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...,0,Knits

I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress it really is so pretty but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly the cut is not right for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection,0,Dresses

It's a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans  if can even be dressed up. however  i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it's a very cute design  it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate  i've gotten many compliments on it! order a size up  i am normally a small but the medium worked be,0,Knits

I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i,0,Dresses

I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing  since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly  so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design  but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.,0,Knits

I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice,0,Dresses

I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.,0,Knits
This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters
I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.,0,Knits

So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.,0,Blouses
I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.,0,Sweaters

I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not,0,Lounge
The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,0,Swim

I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.,0,Blouses

This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute,0,Blouses

This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se,0,Dresses

I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,0,Blouses

I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.,0,Dresses

I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store  so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in  meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are,0,Lounge

Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.,0,Dresses
It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,0,Dresses
So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.,0,Dresses

I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(,0,Jeans
What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.,0,Knits

The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,0,Swim

I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,0,Knits
I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,0,Jackets

I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.,0,Knits
I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.,0,Sweaters

First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,0,Blouses

Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.,0,Dresses

I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,0,Fine gauge

I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,0,Intimates
I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n,0,Blouses

I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.,0,Sweaters
If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses

I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,0,Dresses
The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.,0,Knits

This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.,0,Dresses
This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t,0,Dresses

I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.,0,Knits
The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.,0,Knits
I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.,0,Blouses
I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch  it's nice to have on hand  but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin  ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall  it's a comfortable piece  but it's more like a thin  long-sleeve t-shirt  rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr,0,Dresses

I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning,0,Skirts
I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.,0,Dresses
I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing  when i tied the strap  the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on  it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.,0,Dresses

This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty  this is great  but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy  but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra  which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly  so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy  which i liked very muc,0,Pants

I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,0,Lounge
The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,0,Jackets
I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.,0,Trend
I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge
I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b,0,Dresses

I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,0,Knits

This item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up  and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining,0,Pants

There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,0,Shorts

Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,0,Layering

Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.,0,Sweaters

Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,0,Fine gauge

I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,0,Fine gauge

I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.,0,Lounge
A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters  i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath  which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.,1,Fine gauge

I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color,1,Jeans

I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!,1,Dresses

This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!,1,Blouses

Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly  it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything  yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's)  but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i,1,Fine gauge

I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown,1,Jeans

I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.,1,Fine gauge
This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however  i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.,1,Skirts
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.,1,Dresses

I don't if it is me  but usually i am a solid size 6  occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light  and while it is a weird texture  it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.,1,Skirts

I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress  twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print  i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s  with tights and boots  but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders  so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not,1,Dresses

Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,1,Dresses

Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.,1,Knits
This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable  with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty  the curved hems are very flattering  and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts  as shown  or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange  yellow and green  and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!,1,Knits

I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input  i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute  but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.,1,Blouses

This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big  as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way  the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.,1,Knits

I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck  fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small  not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical ,1,Knits

A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places  no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size  you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.,1,Blouses

I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50  even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish  and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri,1,Dresses
I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse  jacket and heeled sandals they are professional  with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.,1,Pants

Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.,1,Blouses

Beautiful dress! love the colors and fit. can be dressed up or down. the only negative is that the buttons fall off. this is my third dress and it too lost a button the first time i wore it. i don't live near an retailer store so i will be keeping it anyways  as this is already my third dress :( my advice would be to reinforce the three buttons as soon as you buy it. there is one at the top  front of the dress and one on each sleeve.,1,Dresses
This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color  not close to red  but it will work well with black  gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.,1,Fine gauge
I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these  however  is high quality and weighty  wearable in fall  but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red  dark pink  and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!,1,Pants

I just received this in the mail today! fabric and construction are beautiful and high quality. my only concern was that it ran short on me all around. i am 5'2  100lbs  32b  24 waist  33 hips. the dress was an appropriate length all around but ran very short in the arm holes  the back cut-out  and the waist. i felt like i was trying to wear a little-girl's dress (and i tend to be short waisted and long-legged as is). i may exchange it for a regular size because it is such a beautiful dress!,1,Dresses

Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality  soft  great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code  so for me  that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try,1,Sweaters

I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c,1,Pants
I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,1,Knits

I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,1,Blouses

I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless  the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person  shorter tops look best.,1,Knits

This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light  airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing  only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect.    ( for ref. 5'7'  140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing,1,Dresses
Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me,1,Dresses
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.,1,Knits
I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year. so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day!,1,Sweaters
"I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs  small frame.",1,Dresses
I love cute summer dresses and this one  especially because it is made out of linen  is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!,1,Dresses
I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.,1,Knits
I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great  butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately  they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly  but too big was a little too boxy.,1,Knits
I love these jeans. at first  i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!,1,Jeans
"I've been looking for a black off-the-shoulder dress and found this baby in store today. for reference  i am 5'8""  34b  140-150 and took a small. this dress is a shift/swing style  so if you're looking for something fitted this isn't your dress. as another reviewer mentioned  ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume. if you are extremely thin or petite  i might size down  but i like my clothing loose vs. fitted so i kept the small. the fabric is g",1,Dresses
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!,1,Blouses
"The style  plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue  & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature",1,Blouses
"So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10"" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem.",1,Dresses
Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love  love this coat,1,Sweaters
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,1,Knits
This is the perfect dress! for it being a long maxi  it's surprisingly lightweight. the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress. i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colors/patterns.,1,Dresses
Nice fit and flare style  not clingy at all. i got the grey color  petite large  fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.,1,Dresses

Love the colors for fall  feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!,1,Skirts
This price is amazing and goes with everything! fits great! so glad i made this purchase.,1,Skirts
This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique  flowing  romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like  fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!,1,Blouses
This is cute with the shoulder detail. i ordered a medium- will be returning for a small. i'm kind of in between small & medium.,1,Knits
"I love this dress ! my husband loves this dress on me ! i ordered on line  it did not come in my usual 4  and it was only in petite. i ordered the 0petite. it fits fine  a little shorter than expected  but i am 5'2"" so it is fine. very well made and lined.",1,Dresses

I get the great reviews. these do for me what no jogger could. i have hips. i never thought these would work. they do and they look just as cool on me as the model. i am a 10-12. i could only find a 12 but i think a 10 would be perfect. they are effortlessly cool and casual...for all body types. i'm so excited i tried these on.,1,Pants
"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.",1,Jeans
Super cute dress - swingy  flattering  easy to wear. the pattern is great  and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short  so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6  but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.,1,Dresses
"I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing  the length is great (i'm 5'5"" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee)  and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron.",1,Dresses
This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.,1,Knits
"I love this skirt for so many reasons!   one  it isn't a circle skirt  per se  which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt  the description states that it's a-line. based on that  i was willing to risk it. also  i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",1,Skirts
I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it's supposed to be a little oversized looking)  great color (i have the ivory and it's beautiful)  and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos  but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings  skirts or just jeans.,1,Sweaters
Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty  complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.,1,Knits
"I love this dress  but i am 5'7"" and a size 12  so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom  but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however  if he would make that ""skirt"" as a stand alone  i would buy in a second.",1,Dresses
"I'm 5'5"" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!",1,Layering
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this  and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit  as i have a large chest  and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8)  and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on  and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2')  so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference  i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",1,Dresses
Love the cotton knit  for the comfort  but from a distance this blouse looks dressier. the embroidery adds a nice flare. personally  i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom  as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants. i found that it ran a little bit  but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway.,1,Knits
Intrepid soul that i am  i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle  then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes  shook it out  hung it up  and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes  the swing is vast  but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun  something i will use for years  wonderfully comfort,1,Blouses
This dress does run large  but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is  and is nicely flowy  but might require a slip.,1,Dresses
This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest  size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however  my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on,1,Blouses
The softest cotton gauze but  not see through. relaxed but  the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress  going back for it in white!,1,Lounge

"I have a sillier style sweater from moth that i got last year and love. this is not as great  but i like the style so i will keep it. i knew the sleeves would be shorter  but wish they were made full length with a little less ""bat wing"". the color is close to as shown- maybe a little lighter. i was hoping for more of a navy since that is what they are calling it- but this is more of a denim blue.",1,Fine gauge
Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous  it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric  but that's what i was expecting  and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.,1,Lounge
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!,1,Fine gauge
I loved this top on the mannequin  so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10  i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..,1,Lounge
I'm 5'4  112 pounds. xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top. fabric is somewhat picky  so long sleeve is necessary. overall  coat is beautiful and worth the money. nice  unique fall piece.,1,Outerwear
"I have about 3 or 4 akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6"" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern  button detail and fabric are all very nice.",1,Knits
I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted it's exactly what i was hoping for. everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect. i highly recommend it!,1,Dresses
This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit  but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up.,1,Swim
This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality  i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.,1,Pants
I wound up returning this shirt  because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall  and long waisted  but slight on top.     the shirt is gorgeous  and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..,1,Knits
I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all  the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dã©colletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me,1,Dresses
This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.,1,Dresses

Beautiful  unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.  i usually wear a 10  but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine)  i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said  i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.  other reviewers have noted that the emb,1,Dresses
"So soft  warm  and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews  and while it fits  it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/2 in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul",1,Sweaters
This is a great  versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering  and the material is soft and lightweight. this  like many retailer tops  runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium  and although i liked the way the tee hung  it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store  so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely  and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:),1,Knits

Good quality dress  except the lining is very sheer and thin. the inner strap of the lining ripped when i tried it on  so be careful putting it on. once on  it fits true to size  the lining is nice to have  so i kept it even though the strap ripped. if you are on the fence between sizes i would recommend going smaller to avoid having this style of dress look maternity on you.,1,Dresses
Beautiful design and soft  warm wool. warm enough to have on outside in the fall (i live in pdx)  and also stylish enough to keep on inside. buy the right size (not too big) because it's meant to fit on the waist and the skirt swings out from there!,1,Sweaters
I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday  as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft  comfortable  and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.,1,Legwear
I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal  ha. i can't wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol,1,Dresses

Love this casual and soft flowing top. its a nice loose fit. slightly big  however i'm petite. asymmetrical hem adds a unique touch. pairs well with a variety of denim skinnies...black  dark denim. planning to try with white ankle skinnies as well. the v-neck is just right. dips enough to show the neckline without revealing cleavage. it's the perfect lightweight layer for spring to fall. i even added a black blazer for a cool evening out. love this top and would buy in other colors.,1,Knits
I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.,1,Dresses
This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops  but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere  but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area  so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton  so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath  and i can't see m,1,Knits

I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer  but it is soft and not structured  like a t-shirt. however  it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me  i usually require peites  but this doesn't come in petites  and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).,1,Jackets
I am 5'9 135lbs  small chest and narrow shoulders. the 6 fits me perfectly. i love the fact that there is a hem  if i decide to let it down just a little. being over 60 and tall  it is so disappointing to find a dress you love but is just a little too short. the fabric is not too heavy for our moderate summers and i think i will wear this often.,1,Dresses

This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite  but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings  with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs  but ordered the s  based on the size chart  it's a perfect fit.,1,Knits
I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6  not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.,1,Dresses

Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday  and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully  is nicely lined  and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long  but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!,1,Knits
I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.,1,Knits

I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable  great style and solid quality so the fringe isn't fraying or falling out.  if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it's not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.  i am really happy with the tops and can't wait to start wearing the black one t,1,Knits
Loving the ombrã© color combination  the smooth lining  the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass  stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted  size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top  i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want  do try it on in person.,1,Dresses
The first reviewer said it was small in the bust  but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere  rib cage and all  but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down  it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches     otherwise  the make is very pretty  i like the texture in the fabric  the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality  but i decided to pass on it  even on sale  since it didn't,1,Dresses

"This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it  it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5""6"" frame  so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant  a little chanel like. and by the way  the belt is included  as another reviewer",1,Dresses

I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,1,Knits

My preference is clothing made of natural fibers  but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric  the color   the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6  i bought a 4. maeve  i like your style!,1,Dresses
I bought this top in black  and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me  but this top is definitely a great length.,1,Blouses

Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric  but i had a gift card  and it is retailer after all.,1,Blouses

I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on  and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger  but  in fact  it's a very surprising find  as others have mentioned. _____________ pros: - a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit. - the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this. - lots of stretch and very  very comfortable. i can see myself wearing,1,Dresses

The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics  but in person i found it femine  pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky  colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy  gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.,1,Dresses

I got this dress in the holly green and it's a lovely shade - perfect for fall and winter. this is why i gave it the high rating. however  be warned that the lining is very form fitting. i thought the dress had more of a fit and flare design to mask flaws like a belly and larger backside  but that's not the case. i had to return it  but for more slender-shaped ladies  the dress is likely a winner.,1,Dresses

I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift  blouson when cinched  or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads  sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d,1,Dresses

I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.,1,Sweaters

Great material  and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up  making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.,1,Layering

I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried  these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing  i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.,1,Pants

The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line  trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly  you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front  which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such. the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure,1,Blouses

This is a really soft  nice  summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back  as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach  but not in a trash-baggy way.     it mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn't leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal  not large -- and usually wear a small. i've found that the top button buttons fine  and looks good when i'm not moving  but it pulls a little when i move around,1,Lounge

This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer  but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt  or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey  which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!,1,Dresses

Cute top. agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person. the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful. it is a very full swing top  but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back. this isn't evident in the photo shown. i usually wear a sm in retailer tops  and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model  in fullness and especially in the arms. it's still cute enough to keep  but i personally probably could have gone down a size.,1,Knits

These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful  comfortable  and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.,1,Lounge

This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape  and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint  and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating  is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating  but not enough that i won't keep the dress.,1,Dresses

This top looks exactly as pictured  it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8''  128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.,1,Knits

I'm glad i saw this item in stores  otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp  and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable  and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!,1,Dresses
I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place  the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places  and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!,1,Dresses
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!,1,Dresses
Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs  you won't be disappointed!,1,Dresses

Thank you  retailer  for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past  and i love it to bits!   i usually wear a size s or xs  but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.

I love the idea  and color  very flattrering and easy to trhrow on  however  i need the petite in this one  and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing  and since it combines xs/s  it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.,1,Sweaters

I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall. the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear. the material is a good quality. this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet.,1,Skirts
Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made  but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews  and it's too large  and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick  (5'5  105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips  making me look a little curvier  which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing  and this piece will spruce up most outfits !,1,Skirts
This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.  i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.  overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale  i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome.,1,Pants
"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5""  medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal",1,Knits
Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos  there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that  it's a beautiful  unique summer top.,1,Knits
Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy  polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening  with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down  it looks great with a denim jacket  then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short  sandals  pumps  you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone  loosely tied  or done in a bow. leggings or ti,1,Dresses
I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline  so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale  but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather  though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n,1,Dresses
This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility  it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt   you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it.,1,Sweaters

"I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high.  i'm 5'1"" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly.  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn't versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn't in love with it  i returned",1,Dresses
Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great!

This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it  the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.,1,Dresses
Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned  it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra  i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry  but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow,1,Dresses
I probably would not have purchased this sweater had i only seen it online because i typically think wool is scratchy  but this sweater caught my eye in the store and it is as soft as a sweater can get. i love the pink with the gold trim. it is so soft and warm. i have washed and worn it a few times already and have not had any problems with stretching  either.,1,Sweaters
Because of how much i have been buying recently  i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round  dress it up or down  and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious.

This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light  flowy  and comfortable  but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual  but still unique and beautiful  please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!,1,Dresses
I'm 5'8  130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric  pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.,1,Pants
I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!,1,Skirts

In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums  i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft  not too stiff or scratchy  and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece  i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter  too. yay!,1,Blouses
I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully  they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know  so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.,1,Jeans
I should preface this by saying that i'm in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i'm keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style  but i wouldn't be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds!,1,Blouses

I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes  typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter  but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser  but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.,1,Skirts

I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress  i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!,1,Dresses
I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on  is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.,1,Dresses

Love this  but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory  winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do  really it's not.    that said  i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right ,1,Knits

I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate  it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t  and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.,1,Knits

There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that  i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front  while very cute  gave,1,Dresses

Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.,1,Dresses

Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,1,Jeans
Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders  it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short  i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there  she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby ,1,Blouses

A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but  it does snag very easily. so far  i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black  which concentrates the black when snagged.,1,Knits

I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.,1,Sweaters
This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).,1,Lounge

I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs  muscular and petite  so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect  i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined  which i think most dresses and skirts should be  so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides  to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline  so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model ,1,Dresses
This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.,1,Jackets
This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design  it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.,1,Skirts
After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls  but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.,1,Swim
It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.,1,Fine gauge
I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up  you'll love it...,1,Knits
"I tried this on in the store  in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one  i could go either way.  the cut is flattering fit and flare  and the colors are rich. i like the ""flowery"" design  good spring piece in my opinion  as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material  buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy  very soft. not too flimsy iether.",1,Dresses
Flattering poncho  pair well with leggings or skinny jeans and booties,1,Fine gauge
In general  if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress  you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale  but it's a pass for now.,1,Dresses
"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit  i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!",1,Sweaters
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs),1,Skirts
The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!,1,Knits
"Bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different. it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have it in an xs and a s and haven't yet decided which i am keeping as they both work. i'm 5'4"" and 116#. going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall. i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well. have i mentioned i love this dress?",1,Dresses
Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.,1,Fine gauge
I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).,1,Skirts
"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite.",1,Jackets
I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft  comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.,1,Knits
I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy  so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well  hang dry  easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!,1,Blouses
Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise  my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red  and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!,1,Pants
"I kept coming back to look at this vest for the color and design and finally gave in. vest is my favorite when dress layer. i hesitate because no descriptions about the model height  the vest may look perfect on her and look like a maxi dress on my 5'4"" body. it turned out just fine. the front is below my knees like the picture of the model. i love the beautiful red and the material that stretches just enough for my arms to move around . this is definitely a good buy.",1,Knits
Ordered online and love it exchanging however from s to m 'cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season:),1,Skirts
This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting  but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.,1,Blouses
I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect.,1,Skirts
"I'm a big ag fan  so i was excited to receive these for my birthday. i really love everything about them  but boy were they long!! even with a 3 inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem. i'm 5'7""  so i don't often have to get things hemmed  but that was a must with these jeans. i recommend these jeans  but unless you're 6 foot tall  plan on running them to the tailors.",1,Jeans
I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft  very good quality  fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!,1,Lounge
Prettier in person! so pretty! i'm 5' 6'' 120 lbs and the xxs fit well. i normally wear a 0-2.,1,Knits
Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side  but i read that many others had the opposite problem  particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me  it looks and feels great.,1,Dresses
The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater  but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.,1,Fine gauge
These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering. highly recommend trying them on  they were better than i expected them to be,1,Pants
Cute top  i actually got a lot of compliments on it.  the white is slightly see through  which doesn't bother me but could bother other people. all around cute casual piece.,1,Knits
This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning  i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!,1,Knits
"Love! i am 5'3"" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase",1,Jeans
"Love this maxi! gorgeous print  flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit  but with a tan this dress will be perfect!",1,Dresses
This dress is beautiful  but not made for someone with a 36d. i ordered a 12 and i could get my chest in this dress. i really wish it fit. it's well made and very beautiful. belt does not come with the dress.,1,Dresses
I didn't have high hopes for these  because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color  i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies  but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom  so purchased the large  but sometimes i can wear medium  so this is great  being adjustable.,1,Intimates
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.,1,Sweaters
I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it's soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin  so i found this a bit itchy right away  but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized  but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh.,1,Sweaters
"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store.",1,Pants
"I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink  both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!",1,Dresses
Unfortunately  the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up  unbuttoned  like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.,1,Lounge
I love this suit! the fit is incredible.     i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time  but i got it on sale  and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!,1,Swim
This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.,1,Knits
I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.,1,Knits

Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape. price is great with extra 40% off so considering to get dark red one as well now!,1,Dresses
I bought this dress in store today in a size 4  i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress  there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.,1,Dresses
Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large.  so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look  order down a size.,1,Sleep
I love these pants! they are very flattering. they do however run long so even though i'm 5'5'' the regulars were crazy long on me and the petite fit me perfectly. i was worried they would stretch out a lot but i've worn them twice and they haven't.,1,Jeans

"This sweater/tunic is lovely - soft  just enough structure in the top to not look like a sack  pretty color. i ordered the ""raspberry"" which is definitely more of a ""burnt orange-red"" to my eye. i understand what another reviewer was referring to regarding quality. the fabric just doesn't feel very substantial or strong. i have a feeling this might not last too long and it's a shame at this price point. i'd love to order another color but will definitely wait for sale. it's office appropriate an",1,Sweaters

I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut  fabric  and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston  sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize.,1,Knits

I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans  and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like  but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer  i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.,1,Knits
Beautiful dress.  the  printed material under the tulle however hung 3 inches lower than the tulle skirt. i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of  tulle skirt because it looked awkward. even after paying full price for the dress i didn't mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful.,1,Dresses
This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid  and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah  it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  hem falls 4 inches above my knees  sleeves fall right at my wrist  and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat  horse print is so cute.,1,Sweaters

I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy  and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd)  so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews,1,Swim

I was a little surprised when i received this dress  as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined  and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through  for it is black  but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this  but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t,1,Dresses

I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif  although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer  although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics  but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small  and the sleeves hit at wrist bone,1,Blouses

It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size  i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.,1,Knits
This dress is very beautiful. the dark color makes it very elegant. i tried on different top (white  silver  light blue  etc). they all look very nice with the dress. you can wear it casually or formally...depending on what kind of top you wear.,1,Skirts
Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s  but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school)  and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings  but its not too bulky so i can keep it on,1,Lounge
T.la has another winner in my book. i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee. it's a soft blue almost light periwinkle. fabric isn't so thin so it not see through. thank goodness. i actually love it so much i'm ordering the other color as well. i absolutely would recommend this cute tee. love love t.la.,1,Knits
I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece  great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt  3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!,1,Fine gauge
Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft  cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.,1,Fine gauge
This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink  which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers  which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic  but it's snug.,1,Dresses
This tunic looks great in person whether you get the red  green  or navy. runs true and hangs well--the ruffle at the bottom is super flattering and the construction of this tunic is impressive! so good i had to get both the red and navy!,1,Blouses
So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color  see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway  i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee,1,Knits

I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color  pattern  slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.,1,Dresses

The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt. the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fall/winter. pair it with some tights  chunky knit and booties  good to go. very flattering one. has a slight a-line cut to it. i love love this one.,1,Skirts
Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me  so the size was good in this  too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short  but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black  too.,1,Pants
This lightweight sweater arrived within a few days of ordering and was packaged well. its fit is true to size and will be perfect for slightly cool days and evenings. the navy blue color is accurately represented in the picture. my only issue with this item is that one of the small lace panels at the hem on the hip is not sewn in all the way. i will keep it since it was on sale  but i need to decide whether to have it fixed or to just remove both of them as they are very small and don't add much,1,Knits
Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.,1,Knits
Like other reviewers  i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however  the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ,1,Dresses

I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight  but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long  but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it  which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.,1,Dresses

Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all  then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite  great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!,1,Jackets
This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight  but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep  but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.,1,Blouses

So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear  and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness  the rise  and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down.   i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!,1,Jeans
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!,1,Dresses

I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.,1,Sweaters
The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge

Love this sweater and it is so soft and cozy cause it has a little wool in it...not scratchy at all.  5'4 138# usually wear size 6.  i got a small regular (not petite).  looks great with leggings and skirts not to long for a shorty like me.,1,Sweaters
I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue)  the fabric is comfortable  definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.,1,Blouses

I thought this top was absolutely beautiful online  and it doesn't disappoint in person. the fabric is divine  and i just love the paisley design. after putting it on though  it did look just a tad boxy  but not enough to return it. i would definitely recommend the top  and maybe a cute belt to accompany!,1,Knits
There are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right now-this is not one of my favorites. while the color is amazing  the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way. the are very close together which is hard to button up. the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hour-glass shape. however  sizing down (which would also fix this problem) would cause the shoulder/arm area to be too tight.,1,Sweaters
This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size  i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.,1,Pants

From quality  to design  and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it.,1,Legwear
I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy  but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.,1,Sweaters
The blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater. the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size. unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering. i really wanted to love this sweater  but just can't figure out how to wear it without poofing. i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots. it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some.,1,Fine gauge
$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money  but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side  but very flattering. plus  the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front  but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b,1,Lounge
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.,1,Dresses

I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality  and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8  but my store only had a 4 available. it fit  but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model  but i'm on the short side.,1,Skirts

The skirt is a little longer than i expected  it hits me at my calf  i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely  very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic,1,Skirts
This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women  like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small  but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color  great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.,1,Blouses

I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however  when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit  but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length  but make sure you size down.,1,Shorts

I love this dress! high quality dress in a classic style. the cotton eyelet detailing is my favorite part and really elevates this from just another black dress. it is a swing silhouette (as described in the product description) so there is a little more volume than a regular dress  but that's what makes it fun and breezy! great dress  can't wait to wear it when it gets a little warmer.,1,Dresses

I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just,1,Dresses
I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit  especially online!      this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.       the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.,1,Swim

Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe  but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and  though feeling substantial  was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.,1,Dresses

I tried this one without a bra  and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.  the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides  so where the seem is on the legs by the wait  didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that  but hard for me not to look at.  also  the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite  but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that  the hem went to below the big part of my calf  so it 3was flatte,1,Pants

Surprisingly flattering on  especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust  the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way)  the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office  under a jacket  or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not,1,Blouses

I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still  i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat  i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i,1,Sweaters
The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust  i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.,1,Dresses

I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans  flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!,1,Blouses

"This is a pretty tunic/dress that looks and fits exactly as shown. i imagine that it would be quite long on anyone under 5'5"" or so  since it falls maybe 2 inches above the knee on me at 5'7"". it's cute  and an easy throw on and go piece. the quality is even good. i decided to return it though because it felt a little plain for the price...maybe if it were more exciting colors or patterns? a slightly more fitted cut? i couldn't place my finger on the exact thing that wasn't clicking for me  but",1,Dresses
I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender  but hey  im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats  sofa  etc. i made the mistake of not washing first  but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.,1,Pants

I love this pullover. i felt it was a little wide at the bottom but i received lots of compliments on it. i ordered a large because i did not want it tight around the bust (i wear a 36j bra) and biceps but i think i would have been fine in a medium.,1,Fine gauge
"I love  love  love this skirt. very flattering. i am 5'7"" 125# with a 27"" waist  and ordered a size 4 based on previous reviews. yes  it is snug through the hips. i think it will stretch a bit with wear; however  i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up (sadly  i was not blessed with much in the way of curves). the material is thick. the skirt is lined. the print is beautiful. this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it.",1,Skirts
Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.,1,Knits
I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m  which is my normal size  and a s  which  if clothes are baggy  i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted  so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it  so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi,1,Jackets
I was worried the green might be on the shiny side  but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops  this top runs small  so order up a size. in most of retailer tops  i'm a small or medium  but in this  i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side  but got on sale  so all smiles here.,1,Knits

Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect  very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels  flats  or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.,1,Pants

The dress looks great both in winter and summer  either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.  the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste  but i still love the dress.,1,Dresses
This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant  beautiful pattern  the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me  so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color  it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!,1,Dresses
I tried on the pink version  really nice  the fit is loose  but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall  very nice.     xs fit at 115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist,1,Knits

This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length  which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off  so i didn't buy it.,1,Fine gauge
Nice  easy to wear dress!,1,Dresses
I loved the print on both  but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit  size down. for myself  m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long  covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design  so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.,1,Knits
"This is a really unique floreat top. unfortunately the petite sizes sold out so i went with an xs. this was too big?too wide in the shoulders and chest  all around actually. my other issue is that it's a heavy material. i just feel like if i was wearing it around all day  i might burn up in it. it did not feel like it was breathable. and finally  i'm 5'2""?even the xs was too long in the back.     i could see how this could look really cool on the right person?i'm just not that person to pull it",1,Blouses
This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,1,Dresses
This is a very pretty  delicate  comfortable dress. i think it fits tts - maybe even a little large. i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly.  the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading. on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into (no loops as in the photo) so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned. i wish i was able to button 1 or 2 as in the photo.,1,Dresses

This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy  soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $,1,Fine gauge

This dress is made of a wonderful  thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck,1,Dresses

This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green  not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband  which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy  elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks  i decided to remove the tie string  which hangs low; it,1,Knits

Nothing wrong with the dress  sadly it's the body i'm putting it on that's less than perfect. fits fine and tts  but just doesn't do anything for my bit wide hips  other than adds to them. hangs nicely  but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said  i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice  simple dress. really versatile.,1,Dresses

I bought this dress in a store  and it suits the body better than on the picture. the pattern is exquisite and beautiful  i receive compliments every time i wear it. it is made of silk  which is a preferred alternative to polyester. but as other reviewers mentioned  it needs a slip  and for an expensive dress it should come with one  or should be fully lined. it is only lined on top. the peep hole is deep  but on my body  it doesn't gap much (i'm 5'7'' 142 lbs). a keeper for me for its beauty!,1,Dresses
They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously isn't the ideal fit but it will manage. it's very cute  but the colors aren't as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.,1,Blouses

I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!,1,Blouses
Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring  summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!,1,Knits
I got this shirt in an xxsp  and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering  although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much  but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right  so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.,1,Blouses
Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up  mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all  so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband  but i don't think that can be prevented.,1,Pants

This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.,1,Dresses

I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.,1,Blouses

This is a great dress! it's comfortable  easy care  and it looks fantastic. i love the bright green color  it's easy to wear alone  casually  or dressed up with cardigans or jackets. for my climate  this is a year-round piece. i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons  and wear it alone in warm seasons.,1,Dresses
The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit  and drapes beautifully.    the top runs tts  but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.    this works for casual or dress. for dress  i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw  i bought this in black  which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black  it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.,1,Knits
"This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated  modern  and flattering. i was surprised that the ""dress"" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay  which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape  but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks  and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it.",1,Dresses
I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit  because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami,1,Dresses

This tunic is a casual  comfy yet stylish piece that is a great addition to my wardrobe. the only thing i find might be an issue is the thin material. i tried wearing a tank top under it but the material is too thin and the outline of the tank was too noticeable and looked odd. removed the tank and all was good! pairs great with leggings,1,Lounge
I ordered the medium  my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely  looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.,1,Blouses
I love this dress so much that i bought it in 2 colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style  comfortable and quality material. however  the cut is much  much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that.     the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent  red-orange. still cute  but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics.     overall  great dress. even better with the sale price.,1,Dresses

Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me  that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes  but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it  not because it's see-through at all (it's not)  but because of the static.     also  this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.,1,Dresses

"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress  with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!    fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy  usually a size 14/16  and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap",1,Dresses
I've worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldn't be happier with it. this dress is extremely flattering. i usually wear a size 12  but i returned the dress for a size 10 which fit perfectly. the exact same dress  but in a different color was being sold at another major store. the other color wasn't nearly as flattering (but still cute) and the price was comparable.,1,Dresses
This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.    the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.,1,Blouses
I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded  worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!  the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build  small bust. true to size.,1,Blouses

Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch  so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look  and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top  and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me  but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g,1,Dresses

This dress is really beautiful  but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low  i could wear a bra with straps with it  the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.,1,Dresses

I ordered the green top in store after trying on a medium that was huge. the small fits me well and i love the flowy style and softness of the fabric. i like it with skinny capri jeans and the color will transition well into fall. i'm in florida where it is still very hot in october. if you typically wear either a small or medium  order the small in this top.,1,Knits

If i could wear this top every single day  i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf  skinny jeans & ankle boots  or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however  i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.,1,Blouses

The texture  mixed yarn  and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said  the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy  almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.,1,Sweaters

This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.,1,Sweaters
Beautiful material and taupe color. the slits are pretty high on both sides  so just be aware of that.,1,Skirts
I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.,1,Sweaters
I bough this top in blue and i really like the color   style and fabric. i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together. it's a departure from more tailored clothing for me.   i keep on trying linen tops and up to now  this seems the best cut for linen. as the fabric stretches  it will still fall nicely.,1,Knits
I love this blazer. its perfect for work  and makes a great statement.,1,Jackets
Very cute and comfortable!does run big  i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.,1,Sleep
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.,1,Jeans
I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.,1,Jeans
I tried this dress in my usual size 4. the slip underneath was a big snug but the dress was fine. i sort of looked like a little girl in this dress. it is very pretty but more for the younger girls~not for the over 50 group.,1,Dresses
When i first saw this dress i was in love. i adore mexican print clothing and i couldn't wait to try this on. unfortunately  it is not as described  and it looks better in the photo than in person. the dress looks like it is embroidered  and it is not- the design is printed. second  it is described as a stretch fabric-lycra spandex-there was no stretch at all except for the back waist which was elastic and the fabric was very stiff. it pulls on over your head and there is no zipper. i couldn't e,1,Dresses
I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade  slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size  however  to get the perfect fit.,1,Jeans
This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.,1,Sweaters
I bought the blue & black  they are great basics. got the small. i am normally a extra small in retailer.,1,Knits
I love this tee! i got the navy color and the quality is good. it's a light and soft linen that is opaque. (i can't vouch for the other color though). it's a very loose fit but it's not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge. i'm very short and the xsp comes to my hip. i'm almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too... the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide  it might show,1,Knits
I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.,1,Dresses
I tried this skirt on in the store  it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it  but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so  i ordered it online  it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store  but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts.,1,Skirts
The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide  but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops  but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium  my normal size.,1,Knits
"I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were ""felted"" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28"") and the skirt sits at the smallest part",1,Skirts
This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater  and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.    zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top  but overall i'm really happy with this dress!,1,Dresses
I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily  newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice  classic fit in the front  i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied  it keeps everything together and is very comf,1,Dresses

Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and it's so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!,1,Dresses

"This is an intriguing looking skirt  with it's sharp diagonal and the ""quilted"" optic pattern front panel. it's a nice twist on a black pencil skirt. i've been wearing it with a longer  wrap sweater in the cold  but imagine that i'll be able to wear it into the spring and maybe even year round with lighter weight tops. the fabric is a little thin in the back and the diagonal doesn't lie as straight or look as sharp as i'd like but for the sale price i paid  i really shouldn't complain. it's also",1,Skirts
I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot  but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me  however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality  thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.,1,Blouses

This dress is really pretty  but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also  the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally  if one was to wear it a lot  the felting might start to fray.,1,Dresses

This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it  and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy  it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases  and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.,1,Knits
These pants are so great  light  comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made  and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.,1,Pants

I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right  not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits,1,Dresses
I ordered this top in all 3 colors  love the peplum.look..  returned the green  which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream   especially going into spring/summer..  kept the yellow and the navy and love..  the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.  it's a very cute top  runs a little large  but is very pretty.,1,Fine gauge

I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes  because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a,1,Blouses

Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way  it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.,1,Knits

This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom  but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer,1,Knits
This sweater is pretty  fits tts  feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures  i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think,1,Sweaters

The cut on this is fantastic  every color way is vibrant and appealing. length just skims over where my hips broaden  which is nice  and my shoulders look strong and tan. however. i prefer cotton  or at least a cotton blend. this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks  the colors will never fade  and the shape won't change. i find the man made fabric very very hot  though.,1,Knits
I love this tee  it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders  a good v-neck  and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.,1,Knits

"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t",1,Layering
I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it!

This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference  i'm 5'2  120 lbs.,1,Dresses

This top is adorable  especially the grey check. timeless staple  with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d  i got a small  it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering  the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu,1,Blouses
"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d  31"" waist  38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it  but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased.",1,Blouses
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys  the 27 fits very comfortably.     i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",1,Jeans
"I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7"" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4  i guess) fit perfectly. sadly  i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale.",1,Pants
"I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the ""coats"" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6"" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open  the coat looked great but when i trie",1,Outerwear
"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle  but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined  but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite  but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",1,Dresses
The lace on this looks like it would be stiff  but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.    it's as see through as the photo. and  i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra,1,Knits

I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews. i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy. yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days. but it hits right at the waistline without being too short. super vibrant colors.,1,Knits
Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short,1,Shorts
My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still  a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!,1,Sweaters
"One of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time. i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box. the only problem is that it runs short in the torso. i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie. for reference  i am 5'6"" 120 lbs  and a 34b. i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small. hopefully it's long enough!!! everything about it is true to size except torso length. i have an average torso  so someone with a large torso m",1,Pants
I tried these on at the store and thought the color  texture and style was very nice  but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle  so i suppose it is still do-able  but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.,1,Pants
These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made  and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate  and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!,1,Lounge
This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!,1,Blouses
Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it  and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great  drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape  but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.,1,Jackets

If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.,1,Knits
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,1,Dresses
These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.,1,Lounge
This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquã©s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl,1,Blouses
Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus  i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!,1,Knits
Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.,1,Dresses

Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4  112 lbs  broad shoulders  athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large  but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed  i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.,1,Knits

Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet  it's almost weightless  which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!,1,Knits

I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine  without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist  but it's still very flattering.,1,Dresses

As others have said  this is even prettier in person. beautifully made  colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium  depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large  it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.,1,Fine gauge

I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.   other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.,1,Blouses

I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale  i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s  but with this one  the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom  and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still  with some awesome heels  this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!,1,Pants

Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.,1,Knits

I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim  and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely  thick  starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying,1,Dresses

Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally  i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love,1,Pants

This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps  but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe  you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate  it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.,1,Dresses

This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back  but also the cut has the scroll print running,1,Jeans
This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up  it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached  the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer  soft and smooth  and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking  from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t,1,Dresses

I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well  although  i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up  but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!,1,Dresses
Fit was very tts.  it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person  it's a fairly medium weight sweater.  i'm 5'8 and curvy  and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model.  i still liked the look  mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt.,1,Fine gauge
Bought this for the beautiful fabric and easy fit which it has. fits nicely through the shoulder area and is a little on the baggy side in the legs but the draping fabric makes up for that. i bought it in petite small and it is definitely long enough for a dress.,1,Dresses
I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past  and i've never been disappointed with quality  style  or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering. i got these in a 4  my usual size  and the fit is perfect. i also got these in the regular  rather than petite  but the length works just fine for my height. i bought these in the grey stripe  but like them so much i think i'll order another pair in the orange.,1,Pants
Like the other reviewer mentioned  this jacket has a very trim fit  so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.,1,Lounge
I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2  i need things that are cute  but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined  breezy linen fabric  machine-washable  and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders  but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give  so if you are large in the chest  my guess would be a possi,1,Dresses
This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,1,Swim
I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile  the top can't be too see through  it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.,1,Blouses
I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style  fit  and fabric. an eternal fan of ag  i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up  dressed them down  and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.,1,Jeans
"I love the classy design and the little surprise bow in the back. i am 5'2"" and about 107lbs  size 0 fit well. i was afraid it might be too short  but on me it is just above the knee. the bow on the back did not hide the bra strap on me  but the fabric is thick overall so that it can be worn without one. the fit is great once on  but it is a little hard to take off  since the zipper is not on the side so there is no relief in the arm/chest area. the color is beautiful  it's true to the pictures.",1,Dresses

I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans  and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow,1,Jackets

Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy  i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem  which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip,1,Blouses

The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.,1,Sweaters

The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears  which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume  the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless  though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid,1,Pants

I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store  but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts)  and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low,1,Dresses

I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down  but i bought it online  so i just decided to live with it. pretty top  though i do think it runs large.,1,Blouses

"Other than the color (i got the rose color)  which is great  i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7"" and the sleeves come right to my wrists  if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.",1,Jackets

I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3)  but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume.  and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!,1,Pants

This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store. i tried two sizes -- i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days -- and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness. the hooks and eyes pull a bit  but i won't be fastening this all the way to the top. the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out. the color is a dreamy pinky nude (more pink than nude)  an,1,Sweaters
So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle  bressay  this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model  but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color  the warmth  the neckline  and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats,1,Dresses
Beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light  yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large  but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is  it works.,1,Knits

These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,1,Lounge
The fabric is beautiful  a bit sheer  but overall lovely. however  the sizing is really off. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14  and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very  very nipped right under the bust. so  if you have no bustline and a super small waist  this top is for you. if you are like me  high waist and straight up and down  this is a pass. in fact  it is really h,1,Blouses
This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles  but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.,1,Legwear
Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top  it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me.,1,Skirts
I ordered the xs p and xxs p in the black one. i thought this would be a fairly classic piece to wear any season (cold offices in the summer  southern california in the winter). the xxs p was a bit better fitted  not too small  but the xs p was ok too  if you prefer a baggier look  so based on that i call it large as i would usually purchase the xs p not xxsp.

These run tiny. i wear a 25/26 in pants and took a medium in this bottom and i'm still not completely comfortable with the fit. love the floral print  but with a bottom this small you don't really see much of the flowers so on mine at least it's just some splashes of different dark colors.,1,Swim

I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.,1,Blouses
This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with  it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.,1,Knits

I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.,1,Knits

This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable  stylish  and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring  summer  and fall.,1,Dresses
In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.,1,Fine gauge

"I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size (0) was sold out. when it popped back i ordered it. i am 5'4"" and i had wondered if i needed the petite (petite 0 was sold out) because of all the reviews i had read. however  the sleeve length is perfect. in a petite  the sleeves would be too short. i don't have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long. the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style! the lapels are long",1,Outerwear
Nice  flowy  comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest  despite the top fitting loosely on me  so i have to wear a layer under it.,1,Blouses

I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges  so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous  and not too big! the quality is fabulous  and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!,1,Knits

Like the other reviewer said  the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue  and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom  and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly.,1,Dresses

I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model  and i'm pretty small on top.  overall  nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site,1,Knits

"From the website picture (in particular  the gray one) this may appear to be ""over-sized."" i can assure you  it is not. i have to return the small i ordered on the over-size assumption  and hope the medium (my usual size) fits because it's a really nice top. the sleeves and the pattern of the weave give it good pizzazz.",1,Knits
I absolutely loved the print on this shirt  and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it. the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person. unfortunately  the shirt is very thin ? much thinner than i'd expect with velvet ? and is so short that it is more like a crop top. even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look  the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel. for reference  i'm only 5'1. i would buy this over again if it were only l,1,Blouses
I love the style of this top  there's good stretch to the fabric so it's very flattering. the length is good for me  as the previous review stated  it's a little long but for me it's lengthening. the lace is lovely  too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.,1,Knits

Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact ,1,Blouses

This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it. it is very soft and cozy. i went with the m/l cause i preferred the longer length  even though i also fit in the xs/s.   i have worn it many times  and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace. when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers  i throw it on when i get cold-its like a cozy hug. i highly recommend!,1,Sweaters
This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i haven't worn the navy yet  but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it isn't too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.,1,Dresses
The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased  but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute  but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.,1,Blouses

I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized  so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust  which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that  especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit.     the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w,1,Knits

So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice  very wide  comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length  i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these.,1,Lounge

I tried this on in the store and loved it. it is very comfortable. i sized up one or two sizes. i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length. it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall. i think it looks better in person than online. would recommend it if you like this kind of dress. love that it has pockets too. great quality.,1,Dresses

"The ""movement"" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some  ""yeah  i can wear these attitude!"" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is ""thick"" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs  and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh",1,Pants

First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas  but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall  if you're considering this jacket  take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.,1,Jackets

Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms  the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling  but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look.,1,Knits

"Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium  the torso length is a bit short  making the garment pull. i sized up to a large  and with room in the hips and the correct torso length  the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference  i am 5'7""  36a  155lb.",1,Pants
I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.,1,Fine gauge
I loved this in the store  but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.,1,Blouses
It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women  this rare pair of pants crosses the divide  flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here  i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.,1,Pants

I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts  half tucked  and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering  it is a tiny bit sheer  but i was wearing a magenta bra  so perhaps i am biased. overall  i think this is a good basic addition  to a summer wardrobe  can be worn with a nice skirt  or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs  can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs  with 30dd chest.,1,Blouses

This top is lovely. it's got a decent length to it  so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt. the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy  which can sometimes cause it to slip/sag off the shoulder -- not entirely off  but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of off-shoulder look! it's very flattering if you tuck it in  or even if you don't. i got this top in red  and it's lovely --a little more towards than coral side than crimson.,1,Knits

The heart version is very pretty  i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs  as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me  like 3/4 length  not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  and short.,1,Blouses

I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on  but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress  which i think is nice  no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about  but it ties the dress together nicely. the front pocket is different  but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before,1,Dresses

I tried this top in both colors. for the black  the lining looks much more peach in person. the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top. you can see it in the picture  but is much more pronounced in person. it appears to be where 2 pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy.  the line is much less obvious in the navy  and looks much more seamless  perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace. the black lining is completel,1,Knits

Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting  but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.,1,Knits

This is beautiful and the leather metallic circles are sewn on really well  i checked a bunch of them because initially that was my concern that one would get caught on someone's clothes. the 6 fits perfect (5'9 and 140 lbs). goes really well with the dark denim shirt that they displayed in store. definitely a fun piece for the holiday season.,1,Skirts
I got this in blue and also in white  both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does  so consider this when you order  depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way  definitely not with leggings.,1,Knits

This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size  though a bit boxy  so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side  but i'm petite  so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear  but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased,1,Sweaters

The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering  particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable  and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys  it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).,1,Swim
I wore this sailboat dress with blue wedges to a wedding and received tons of compliments from men  women and children. i love the material  pockets  and flattering cut. definitely iron it beforehand because it wrinkles.,1,Dresses
This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing  even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high  it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely  not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6,1,Dresses
I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large  but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!,1,Dresses
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.  2. i love the hyphen chinos  and these fit almost the same  just a bit trimmer. they are not tight  and just skim my body perfectly.  3. i love all the colors. the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks.  4. the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work.",1,Pants
"An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the ""yes i'm buying right now"" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale  i am buying more colors.",1,Dresses
"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey  and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference  i ordered my normal size xs (5'5  115 lbs  muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves  but i still think there would be adequate room.",1,Jackets
I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made  comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!,1,Dresses
There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top. that being said  the cotton is substantive and crisp  the embroidery striking  the coral color bright and summery. it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden  which i honestly kind of hate  but the top is so lovely no one's going to be assessing your hips. if you have narrow hips and perky breasts  though  what a perfect summer top (although  i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect!),1,Blouses
Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!,1,Outerwear
Very pretty cardigan but it is huge! i ordered a large (normally xl or large) and it is so big! the shoulder seam comes to middle of my upper arm. i wanted to exchange it for a medium but they are out of stock. bummer.,1,Knits

"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts  and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal  unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not.",1,Jackets
Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order 1 size up and compare.,1,Knits
I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping  and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl,1,Blouses

Very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times (cardigan  tights etc) difficult.,1,Dresses
These are perfect for pulling off a finished look  proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial  lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!,1,Shorts
This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am,1,Blouses
Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high  my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin  not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a,1,Fine gauge

I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb  heavy and glossy  good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete,1,Lounge
Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash  so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist  slim hips  flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.,1,Jeans

I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in,1,Dresses

This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue  and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine  just larger and even more roomy)  but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans  flats  leather boots  o,1,Blouses
This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok  will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.,1,Dresses
I have this in both the black and red. great design. very flattering and soft. the red is the perfect color. will get a lot of west from these for many years.,1,Fine gauge
This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!,1,Blouses
I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;),1,Dresses
I am 5'9  very long waisted  generally a size 10-12 or med  but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.

I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color  since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.,1,Outerwear

This top! it is so simple  but so great at the same time! it does run large  and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft  washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual  but so comfy. it's great for loungin,1,Knits

I ordered my usual size s in the purple print. this peplum top style  colors/pattern will go easily with pretty much anything.. shorts  pants  jeans & skirts. wear for casual or dress it up. for me the fit is tts. armholes provide good coverage & length is fine. the top has a bit of stretch & doesn't feel restrictive. the waist is banded & a little loose which is fine. don't like tight fitting waists on tops. i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer. the skirt,1,Knits

My mother  who is not a dress person  ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress  and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile  she decided to try it  and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images  but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully  and looks extremely elegant.,1,Dresses
I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting  but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area  which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe,1,Sleep
Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,1,Shorts
It's really a casual tee  but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color  it can have a little more dressed to go out look. i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture  but has a nice flattering flow. a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale.,1,Knits

Such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery. it's very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately. i ordered the 6p because the 8p was sold out and although the top fits quite well  its just too snug on the hips. if the 8p was available i would definitely exchange it for that.,1,Dresses

I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.,1,Knits
"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy  so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available  but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence  go for it. totally worth it..",1,Sweaters
