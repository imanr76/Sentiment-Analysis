I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.,0,Dresses
I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt  which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still  the quality seemed to be good.,0,Knits
It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible ,0,Dresses
I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however  after i washed it the first time  it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!,0,Knits
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!,0,Pants
"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however  it doesn't even cover my butt  that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4""  i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",0,Sweaters
I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.,0,Knits
The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at,0,Knits
This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,0,Blouses
I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.,0,Dresses
Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses
Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders  normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.,0,Knits
"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",0,Intimates
I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!,0,Dresses
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.,0,Shorts
"I am 5'4"" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter",0,Dresses
The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized   therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders   the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .,0,Blouses
Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.,0,Jeans
These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(,0,Jeans
I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.,0,Knits
"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered""",0,Knits
I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice  flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap  and i do not have a flat stomach  so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.,0,Skirts
I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses
I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.,0,Knits
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.,0,Sweaters
I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,0,Intimates
"This dress is really gorgeous  really fun and beautifully made. i'm typically an 8petite (140lbs  5'4""  34dd) so i got this in an 8 and it was huge on me. there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me. even if i sized down  it feels a little age inappropriate for me. i'm 21  and it felt very conservative and unflattering.  i think this dress is excellent  just not for me.",0,Dresses
The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,0,Fine gauge
Thought i would love this product  but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.,0,Knits
Ahhh  i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed  this top runs very large. style wise  it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.,0,Blouses
I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.,0,Knits
Sadly  this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch  my purse  my necklace. i had to go home  change  and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.,0,Dresses
A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest,0,Knits
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,0,Dresses
"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!",0,Dresses
I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings  but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.,0,Knits
The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought,0,Sweaters
The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .,0,Dresses
Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it  however it just did not fit.,0,Dresses
"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12. the colors  the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.",0,Dresses
This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.,0,Knits
"Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.",0,Knits
I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely  but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned  this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well  i also didn't love the collar  which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po,0,Blouses
While i love the design  this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.,0,Sweaters
As the other reviewer said  this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer  and i am short... i tried on xxs regular  xs petite and xs regular.    xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders  cehst)  but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular  a bit longer  but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this  but probably something beter wil lcome along.    great for those who want to show their assets,0,Blouses
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,0,Knits
Love the color  but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms  the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.,0,Sweaters
I loved this coat in the picture  and couldn't wait to get it. sadly  it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv,0,Sweaters
Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,0,Blouses
This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.,0,Fine gauge
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",0,Outerwear
I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.,0,Dresses
Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.,0,Sweaters
I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through. taking it back.,0,Knits
"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size.",0,Blouses
Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,0,Blouses
The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.,0,Dresses
"Bought a pair of the gray and loved them  but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine.     so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem?     anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a ""washed look"" that's on purpose.     i'll still wear them  but an expe",0,Pants
This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.,0,Knits
Very nice top  like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am  and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think  just not a flattering oversize fit for me,0,Knits
This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.,0,Knits
This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality  but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit  just wasn't as striking as i expected.,0,Swim
I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft  comfortable fabric  as other reviewers have mentioned  and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace  nothing sharp  pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.,0,Knits
I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.,0,Knits
I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters
Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.,0,Blouses
"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.",0,Pants
I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however  the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly  but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price  i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous  so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .,0,Dresses
I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi,0,Dresses
I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.,0,Fine gauge
The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.,0,Blouses
I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy  sleeves way too long  etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line  you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.,0,Dresses
Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.,0,Knits
This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,0,Knits
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.",0,Dresses
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,0,Knits
What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.,0,Knits
The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.,0,Blouses

"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",0,Jackets
Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric  meaning the dress  is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.  the dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the,0,Dresses
I got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though,0,Pants
This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life  not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...,0,Dresses
"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",0,Shorts
As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0,Skirts
Loved this online  but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.,0,Skirts
I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it  it looked exactly as it does in the picture online  however  the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms  which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt  but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.,0,Knits
This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin  and had to return it because of this. otherwise  it would have been a keeper.,0,Knits
I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered  it was comical. so so boxy. literally  shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person  it may look super cute! just didn't work on my slim build. :(,0,Knits
I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice  thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom  just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end  which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs  and the xs was not even,0,Knits
These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.,0,Jeans
Love this  but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic  the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it,0,Sleep
This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses
The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(,0,Jackets
"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",0,Dresses
I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!,0,Pants
I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.,0,Swim
I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it's still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess. unfortunately  that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.,0,Blouses
I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is  unfortunately  more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well  but i bet it is lovely in navy.,0,Dresses
These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.,0,Legwear
The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,0,Jeans

I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person  i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1  which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.,0,Trend

There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,0,Blouses

Based on the photos  i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline  fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering  but the fabric is thin and clingy  making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was,0,Dresses
Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,0,Outerwear
I wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful  but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.,0,Blouses
Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,0,Jackets
I had a really  really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it  i wanted to love it! in theory  it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however  as you can see for yourself in the photo  this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle,0,Dresses

I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.,0,Dresses
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.,0,Dresses

Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,0,Dresses

I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large  and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package  i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on  and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model  it will work for you. it is made of cupro  looks exactly like the photo  the color is g,0,Dresses

This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly  however  this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large  the length too short  and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit  since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.,0,Dresses
I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.,0,Pants
"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm  no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b  weigh 110 pounds  5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!",0,Knits
After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.,0,Fine gauge
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,0,Knits

Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,0,Fine gauge
I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost  this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.,0,Trend
Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.,0,Jeans
"This sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......",0,Outerwear
Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.,0,Dresses
When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh,0,Dresses
This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front  that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue  but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.,0,Blouses
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",0,Dresses

Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.,0,Pants

These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price,0,Pants
This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami,0,Knits

I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.,0,Knits
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,0,Skirts
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,0,Dresses
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much,0,Sweaters
I love the unusual print  but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back  and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!,0,Dresses
As much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online  i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.,0,Dresses
"The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4"" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....",0,Dresses

I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped  so the hip area looked terrible. but  the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas,0,Knits

I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.,0,Fine gauge
Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.,0,Knits

So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,0,Legwear

I tried this dress on in the store  prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer  it would look more proportionate. next  the tie is really difficult to place  but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily  i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined  what a bummer  at least the skirt could be lined. but  it does have pockets  that is sweet.,0,Dresses
After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer!

I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.,0,Dresses

I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!,0,Dresses

I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...,0,Blouses
I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,0,Legwear

I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.,0,Sweaters
I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.,0,Knits
I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.,0,Dresses

I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.,0,Dresses
It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,0,Dresses

I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!,0,Dresses

I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!,0,Blouses
These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.,0,Legwear
"I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color  the fabric  and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.  now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a",0,Lounge

This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,0,Sweaters

The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo  my measurements are 38-30-40.,0,Blouses

I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.,0,Dresses
I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(,0,Jeans
I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,0,Intimates

I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out,0,Dresses

So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have,0,Blouses

I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller  slimmer bod,0,Knits

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0,Knits

The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,0,Jeans

These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.,0,Pants

Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.,0,Blouses
I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!,0,Dresses
"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",0,Layering

This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.,0,Blouses

"I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.  the ""shawl"" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed. i already returned this.",0,Dresses
Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.,0,Knits

This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,0,Fine gauge

This t is a beautiful color  and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy  however - very thin cotton fabric  without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips so instead of covering them  it highlights them. i'm disappointed  and am returning it.,0,Knits
Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!,0,Blouses

I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.,0,Dresses

I really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.,0,Knits
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer  and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly  but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money  i could get it tailored  but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!,0,Dresses

The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how,0,Dresses
I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious  wonderful for fall or winter  and the gold  gray  and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus  pockets! however  the midi length did not work for me  despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length  just above the knee. i'm not,0,Skirts
A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,0,Fine gauge
I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress,0,Dresses

I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,0,Lounge

"Cute print on both sides  but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.",0,Swim
"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace  substantial fabric  great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders  and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model  they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned  the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4""  120 lbs  and tried a size s.",0,Blouses
I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however  i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it  the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch  but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it  so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this  i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.,0,Dresses

I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles)  the length is perfect  the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all  unlike another reviewer) the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look  which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide  swingy style  but with the sl,0,Sweaters

This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus  the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a,0,Skirts

This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know  it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my,0,Knits

I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.,0,Jeans
I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.,0,Dresses

So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.,0,Lounge
The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.,0,Knits
I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.,0,Dresses
"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",0,Skirts
I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning  but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium  so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.,0,Dresses

The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,0,Dresses
I got an xs in this suit.  i am 5'1  100#  a32.  this was much much too small.  it was very tight around the chest and i am only a 32a.  it is  however  a good looking suit.  i suggest sizing up.,0,Swim
"Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold",0,Lounge

From the photos  i thought the design was embroidered. in reality  it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.,0,Sweaters

"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",0,Outerwear

While the dress is pretty  it's a lot more boring than it seems online. the box top is actually a completely separate piece  which is kind of neat - you can choose to remove it or not. the box top is very wide (much wider than on the model) and very unflattering! also  the dress is a stiff silk fabric and doesn't flow like you would think it would. returning it!,0,Dresses
This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.,0,Sweaters
I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.,0,Knits
The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.,0,Knits
This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!,0,Outerwear
The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.,0,Dresses
I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also  the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol,0,Dresses

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.,0,Dresses
These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.,0,Pants
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6"" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",0,Knits

I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.,0,Dresses

I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee,0,Dresses
Lightweight  airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker  higher quality silk. the waist has a tight  wide  elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.,0,Skirts
I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s,0,Knits

While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.,0,Dresses

The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,0,Fine gauge

I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,0,Dresses
Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses

The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,0,Skirts
The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also  i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27  but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.,0,Trend

I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.    first  it is way too short for me  especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay  to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also  the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th,0,Lounge

This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,0,Dresses
I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty  intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material  this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i,0,Knits

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend

I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,0,Fine gauge

This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted  almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly  not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.,0,Dresses
So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.,0,Pants
I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.,0,Fine gauge

If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses

Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms.

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters

This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material  it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me  but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.,0,Knits

It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the,0,Dresses

The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.,0,Fine gauge
I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.,0,Knits

This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,0,Jackets

I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge ,0,Swim

I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,0,Knits

After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the,0,Dresses
I bought this top and it ran huge  i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad  i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.,0,Knits
"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.",0,Blouses
The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t,0,Fine gauge

I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.,0,Knits

This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0,Blouses

I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink  but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large  hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle  but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.,0,Lounge

I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.,0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis,0,Blouses

With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha,0,Dresses
These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,0,Sleep
This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.,0,Shorts

I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.,0,Knits

I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.,0,Dresses
I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc,0,Jeans

This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist,0,Dresses

This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.,0,Knits

I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean  but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture  which is fine  though i was digging the slightly greyed look.    anyway  these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build  so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs ,0,Jeans

This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way  did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric  go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.,0,Trend

Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,0,Pants

The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,0,Jackets

Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel,0,Dresses

I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart,0,Blouses
Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,0,Dresses

This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.,0,Blouses
This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0,Dresses

This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,0,Dresses
Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.    wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate,0,Dresses

I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of,0,Lounge

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.,0,Dresses
First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,0,Blouses

I love the look of this pullover  however  it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.,0,Sweaters
I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge
I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.,0,Shorts
I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.,0,Jeans
For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir,0,Skirts
I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.,0,Sweaters
This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time.,0,Knits
This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.,0,Dresses
I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed,0,Dresses

Usually wear s and xs  tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers  green on outside  and a polyester beige layer underneath.  but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.,0,Blouses
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.,0,Blouses
I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright  but once i slipped it on  it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted  i'm s little bottom heavy  so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.,0,Dresses

I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full,0,Skirts

I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape,0,Fine gauge

I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.,0,Knits

This is a flattering  comfortable  soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that  however  i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy  and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.,0,Sweaters

A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i,0,Dresses

I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0,Dresses

The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts

Online  i like the design  the leaves stand out. in-person  the leaves don't stand out as much  you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame  i think. it was just too light and thin for me.,0,Knits

I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.,0,Dresses
I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even,0,Swim

This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,0,Skirts
I was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on. the small was huge (im 5'8  130lbs)  the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body  making it feel tight/stretched against my shoulders. i love the print and style  and would have bought it if it was $100 less. however  at the current price  it needs to fit perfectly  which sadly it did not.,0,Pants
I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing  when i tied the strap  the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on  it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.,0,Dresses
I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i,0,Dresses

I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.,0,Dresses
This is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.  i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.,0,Dresses
This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.,0,Sweaters
It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.,0,Blouses
This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price  but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest  but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest  so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.,0,Knits
This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses

I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing  as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.,0,Pants
"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",0,Jeans

I was disappointed in this bordeaux top  a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium  my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also  the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra  the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.,0,Knits
I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo,0,Knits
"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",0,Shorts

So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.,0,Dresses

This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.,0,Dresses
Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,0,Fine gauge

I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,0,Blouses

I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex,0,Knits

I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,0,Jeans
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,0,Dresses
I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.,0,Sweaters
I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,0,Swim
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.,0,Knits
This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will.

Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses

I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.,0,Knits
I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.,0,Skirts

After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black,0,Dresses

This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).,0,Knits
The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.,0,Sweaters

I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice  light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification  however  it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist  larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips  but does very little to show off my waist. overall  it is just ok.,0,Dresses
Not that i don't recommend  only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird  no kidding  kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit  so perhaps they run small?    i would get petite if you are usually a petite  the regular size bunched on the bottom  too long.    i am usually a 0p or 00p  or,0,Pants

I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.,0,Pants
I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!,0,Knits
"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.",0,Knits
I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.,0,Blouses

I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn't flattering on me.,0,Blouses

Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.,0,Knits

I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!,0,Blouses
I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,0,Jeans
I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape  i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff  and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.,0,Knits

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses
This is a cute  flattering dress  however the drop-waist  the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant  mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.    my big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee,0,Dresses

The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.,0,Knits
I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives,0,Blouses
The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.,0,Dresses
I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs  36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.    the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as,0,Knits

Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,0,Sweaters

I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.,0,Blouses

This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...,0,Dresses

This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.,0,Blouses

I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t,0,Dresses
It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all! it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature.,0,Sweaters
I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.,0,Fine gauge
I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.,0,Knits

I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.,0,Pants

I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.,0,Blouses

I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad  i would have bought it for sure.,0,Blouses
I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.,0,Knits

So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.,0,Dresses
It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,0,Skirts
These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.,0,Pants
I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!,0,Dresses

I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.,0,Knits

I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color  pattern  slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.,1,Dresses

"Like another reviewer  i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length  the cut  the stripes  but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5""10"" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally  i'm all for tailoring to fit  but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'",1,Dresses

This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.,1,Knits

I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top  i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.,1,Dresses
I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,1,Blouses

This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight  but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep  but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.,1,Blouses

First of all  this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online  i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans  i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist  big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also  there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck,1,Pants

Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes  you might want to size down. if i did order a small  the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer  so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w,1,Blouses

This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester  and it is  but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large  so go a size smaller than you would normally  and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester  why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth,1,Dresses

I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however  the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright  which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example  the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa,1,Dresses

I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.,1,Blouses

I like the cut and look of this shirt  and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs  30ss chest)  but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun  and the color is adorable  but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.,1,Knits

"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1""  so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me  but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!",1,Dresses
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist  but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.,1,Knits

This suit is really flattering and comfortable. i love the pattern and the removable strap. the only downside is the top of the suit folds down easily showing the lining at the top. this has been the case with other suits i've bought from retailer  but it's so flattering that i can live with that flaw.,1,Swim
Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale  and while it was cute on  i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there,1,Dresses
This dress definitely runs large  so i ordered it through my local store  in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down  but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival  yesterday  and it fit right in :-) very comfortable  and fun to wear.,1,Dresses

I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit  not too tight for legging jeans  which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable  but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black  so looks great with everything!,1,Jeans
This top is so beautiful and well made  and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before  and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet  but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this  you won't regret it!,1,Blouses

For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight  it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length  super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet  but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.,1,Knits
I just received these in the mail  but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27  so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.,1,Pants

This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size  i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.,1,Blouses
This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top  as how you can see at the model's armpit  wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top  i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!,1,Knits
I love this top. in fact  when i saw in the store  i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.,1,Blouses

Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first  ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6)  returned it for a large. unfortunately  the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped  not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.,1,Outerwear
The embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navy/grey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown. i'm 5'6 and tried an xs and small  the small definitely fit better in length. the body of thr blouse is loose  almost boxy. cute top  just not what i'm looking for.,1,Blouses

I liked the idea of the scarf tie  so i tried on this top in the store. it was so cute on  that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality. the material is more of a t-shirt with elastic at the bottom  so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat. i'm not sure how durable the fabric is. it's still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color. i think ti would look great with jeans but  with the right pants  i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work. it,1,Knits

I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern  the feel  and the fit. comfortable  fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available  but am perfectly happy with the regular length.,1,Lounge
I must politely disagree with the previous review. i hesitated to order this item based on the reviewer below and i am happy to say this item is everything i hoped it would be! it looks exactly like the picture (fit  color  quality). being a silk top i believe this item was priced appropriately and the quality of the item does not disappoint. the pom poms are colorful and bright but not the least bit juvenile. this top is light and flowy yet flattering for hot  humid summer days! i will look for,1,Blouses

Only the xxs was left  so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference  i'm 32c  5'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color  along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable  too. love so much i  ordering more!,1,Intimates
I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made  comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!,1,Dresses

I tried on xs in the store (returned) and it looked huge on me  i like the rushing idea  the material is super soft  but overall  couldn't justify even at sale with 40% off  as it wasn't flattering when it looks big. blue color nice in person.,1,Knits
Fancy and fun. i love the green and the texture. shiny outside and soft inside. flattering fit and a little whimsical and dressy or casual.,1,Knits
I ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it. i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly. i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model - i wish i would have listened. while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches  it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through. i didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy. this top does show many of,1,Knits
Like everyone else  i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it wasn't until  i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so haven't been able to wear it much  but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it's classy and can dress up any outfit.,1,Jackets

Love  love  this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs  just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long  long  time.,1,Knits
This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.,1,Blouses
I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly  the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.,1,Fine gauge
This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!,1,Dresses
Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.,1,Dresses
I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also  i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!,1,Knits

The color of this dress is amazing! even though it's not lined  the fabric looks and feels like silk charmeuse and is so light and comfy on your skin. more of a maxi than a midi on me; i'm considering shortening it. elegant and breezy at the same time - love it!,1,Dresses
I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size  and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!,1,Blouses

I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!,1,Skirts
"It's a lovely and unexpected sweater. a few things to keep in mind-     - the knit details are beautiful- the pictures don't do it justice.    - it's pretty lightweight.    - the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum    - it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long.     - the style is decidedly casual and ""slouchy"". it looks great with jeans  but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.",1,Knits

The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!,1,Knits
I don't know why i had the opposite problem most reviewers had with these..... i tried on the regular length in the store and found that they were just a bit too short with heels. (i'm 5'5 ). i had them ordered in a petite and when they came  they were too short with flats! maybe it's the way i like to wear them  i like my flare jeans to barely skim the ground. i just exchanged them for regular length and will wear them with a small wedge shoe. aside from the length issues  these are super cute,1,Jeans

Even though this is an online exclusive  i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!,1,Dresses
I am 5'5. 125 pounds  size 4-ish (sometimes a 4  sometimes a 6)  athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist  about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.,1,Pants
Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.,1,Sweaters

This dress is beautiful. however  it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress  which is not pictured. the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream. i sized up bc i didn't want it to be too fitted  i'm between a 6 snd 8 so i went w medium. it fits will but slightly big. i'd say tts though.,1,Dresses

"This sweater is very nice. i bought it online recently with a discount on the discount and felt i got an amazing bargain. it is not larger than expected  but is not exactly the fit the model's picture implies. it is a roomier design. nonetheless  it is well-made and all wool  instead of that mystery mix of fibers that sometimes is the case with things described as ""wool"". the one thing that might be more discouraging to online buyers is that the color is not the lovely blue the picture depicts ",1,Sweaters

"Love this dress! the embroidery is stunning and adds to each detail of the dress. i love the pink undertone. it is subtle. it makes it more unique. this is why i love online exclusives. they have that ""one of a kind"" look to them. the quality is great and the style is that there really is no shape to it. it has a nice everyday feel  but along with its elegance  can easily be dressed up as well. priced a little high is my only complaint.",1,Dresses
"Glad i went in to buy this: in store i was surprised by the texture which was much more cotton (almost gauze-like) than most cloth & stone shirts made with tencel. the blue looks like demin online but in person is a rather ugly dark blue  the pink was almost red  but the yellow was beautiful!  it is double-lined which is one of the best things about it.   i'm usually between a s and m and could have gone either way but choose m because it was a little longer and ""flowy-er"".",1,Blouses

First of all  this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly  it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless  it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however  i was able to go down a siz,1,Dresses

The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing  but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut  and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender  this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest  size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl,1,Dresses

It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes  it runs big and wide but not long  which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer  but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top  easy breathing for humidity.   i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap  so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh,1,Knits

I picked this tunic up on sale; it works wonderfully with several of my cardigans and vests; just add skinny jeans or leggings and some boots for a fun  super comfortable look. the sleeves are oddly extra long  but not a deal breaker as rolling them up gives that unfinished cool look. i hate ironing  but i will iron this top as its so much fun to wear. the embroidered and beaded detail is quite nice.,1,Blouses
I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft  good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top  but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still  a very nice top. i may buy it eventually  especially if it goes on sale.,1,Fine gauge

These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look  they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!,1,Pants
I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.,1,Intimates

One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms  sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.  boiled wool fabric is light  which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.  thank you  rosie neira.,1,Sweaters
This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy  soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $,1,Fine gauge

I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.    i normally wear an 18  sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths  but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12  so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.    this dress fits in,1,Dresses
"This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns  the beading and the texture. however  i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8"") with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however  the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a",1,Dresses

This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.,1,Skirts
"So to put this in some perspective  when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home  he described it as ""possibly the best dress you've ever bought."" so that's definitely a winner! i think what makes the dress great is that it's not clingy  but still had a good drape. on the skinny models  it looks large and flowy  but on my curvier body  it draped beautifully and is super flattering  without being clingy or too tight. i'm usually a size 10  36ddd  and i sized down to a medium s",1,Dresses
I ordered the blue version in size xl. it looked just like the photos online. it fit true to size. the problem for me was the weight of the sweater. it was too bulky & uncomfortable to wear. the color of blue was nice. the knit wasn't very soft but wasn't scratchy either. i found a better choice from retailer so i returned this.,1,Sweaters

This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style  with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off  it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.,1,Fine gauge
I've never bought a tee at full price  in so many colors. i love this tee.it's quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'2 -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple  navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio,1,Knits

I saw this sweater online and had to try it. i went to my local retailer to try it on and i'm glad i did. i am usually a xs - s in tops and i thought this fit best in a medium. it's very chunky which is what i was looking for and so soft - not scratchy at all. it has wide bell sleeves  but that's very on trend right now. i am 5'4  34b and it falls about an inch below the top of my jeans. it's not form fitting but so snugly. i plan on wearing it with dark denim skinnies  booties  and simple jewlery,1,Sweaters

"I purchased this gaucho as a gift for my mother.  at first  i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.  but later  it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.  it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.  it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.  however  i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashion.  so  if you happen to save those ""good old fashion""  take them out and try",1,Pants

Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice  and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush  and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress  will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work  with heels for evening. oop  my usual size  fits perfectly (5'4  110 lbs).,1,Dresses
I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit  suprisingly  the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips  and waist  the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes,1,Knits
Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering  with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person  the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute  i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.,1,Pants
This sweater is beautifully detailed  however  it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open  as shown  on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown  detail better in person.,1,Sweaters

I never buy shorter shorts  my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering  but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model  but hit a nice spot on the leg  and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs  all legs...,1,Shorts

Love this top  looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short  so for me the high waist pants were a must  but if you don't mind showing your belly  then it would be cute with anything  the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.,1,Knits
Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight  especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered  size up.  it has a dreadful side zip  is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p  my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#.,1,Dresses

Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,1,Jeans

I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion  it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits  so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color  there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction  so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging,1,Knits

This was a really nice  soft lightweight sweater  perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem  it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price  but the color was really pretty and on sale  i would def. go for it. for reference  i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.,1,Knits
Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd  so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.    the fabric is sheer but not overly so  embroidery is well done. over all a b,1,Blouses

I typically wear xs or s  or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big  it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.,1,Sweaters

I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green  but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms  even across my chest  and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so  while beautiful and so incredibly soft  it has to go back.

I also agree with the other reviewers that it's important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors didn't do much for me  i think they look great on the model but that's because the beige doesn't blend into her at all. i also think it's a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress.,1,Dresses

When i saw this top online i loved it  and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops  and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer  but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is  if you a little busty  the neckline might dip a tiny bit,1,Blouses

"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case  this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!",1,Dresses

I was so excited for another fun white shirt. this was fits the bill! its cute  it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large. it is also not white  white  has a touch of ivory. still  is a great top with skinny jeans. received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee  the lady was going online to get one for herself!,1,Blouses
This dress is incredibly soft! with sleeves that can be rolled up or down  it is extremely versatile. while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size  i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first. however  i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure. overall  i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels!,1,Dresses

Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly  cotton  and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.,1,Knits
The deep v doesn't gape  and flatters the neckline  while the waist-high side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless. the material is so lovely and soft and comfy  but clings in the right places to really flatter  while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way.,1,Knits

This coat is beautifully made and for $800 i expect no less. however  i should have checked other resources prior to buying. the color on this website is nothing like actual color of coat. i was expecting a nice dark red/wine as depicted on these photos. however  it is a bright magenta/dark fuscia more on the purpleish side that does not go so much with my wardrobe (even though i am a pink-loving person haha). i had hoped to pair it with the same skirt shown here and the peony sweater that was i,1,Outerwear

Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,1,Fine gauge

"I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol)  and was nervous that the neck would be tight  based on the other reviews. however  once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didn't create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7""  36dd 135lbs.    i would say this items runs true",1,Blouses

This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large  i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference  i'm 5'7''  125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.,1,Sleep

I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night  for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!,1,Blouses
"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",1,Intimates
"These are very cute and i bought both colors. they are accurately pictured. however  right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor. must be the dye. i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them. they seem to be ""calming down"" a bit but it's been two days!! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen. dress up or down. i'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well.",1,Pants

Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me    i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)   if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned    great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length,1,Skirts

It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.,1,Knits
So i really like this top. not my usual choice  but i'm trying to branch out. really like the top (i got the white one because they had it in my size). only thing is i could have sized down but arms/shoulders/bust are super tight so i went with the larger size. i got mine on sale and a button had already fallen off the back so forewarning that may be a problem in future....     but overall i really like this top.,1,Blouses
I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!,1,Dresses

Just got this top in the mail today  and i love it. i bought the white in a small  and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton  but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined  so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large  as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer  and a lot of summers,1,Blouses

I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.,1,Knits

I couldn't resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest. i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly. the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints. i love the longer cut since i'm 5-10 and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge. the blue is darker than the online picture shows and i'll probably be going back for that but at almost $100 i'm hoping it'll go on sale.,1,Blouses
This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!  be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!,1,Dresses
I love the black and pale pink of this dress  the contrasting fabrics and the embroidery. my favorite kind of dress  creative and a little edgy  but elegant and can be dressed for the office too. ordered a size up from my usual size because i tried the previous dress in this style and it was a bit snug. the size up was a good decision  fits in the shoulders and waist better. the fabrics are nice and the finishing on the dress is well done. the mesh in the bodice is a little delicate and i will h,1,Dresses
This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am  you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.,1,Knits
This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!)  and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full  but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.,1,Dresses

I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton  and even though it is heavy and substantial  the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater  i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck  but my hair hides that. overall ,1,Sweaters

Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive  but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j,1,Jackets
Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet  but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined  and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i,1,Jackets

"I am 5'6"" and wear a medium. i ordered an 8 and a 10 and am keeping the 10  which is a little large but  importantly  is a full 2 inches longer than the 8. this is important to me because several of my casual pants begin a couple of inches below the waist and  as noted by another reviewer  and as is evident on the model  the top hits just below the waist. also  it is cotton/linen and may shrink (since it is ivory  i assume it will see a few washings). i don't want to worry about the ""gap""  but i",1,Blouses

After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool  i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine  and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer  rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved  high waist is flattering. regardi,1,Sleep

When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference  it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so  i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo,1,Dresses

I was impressed with the textured knit of this piece  which looked nicer in person than online  and the open neckline with a contrasting stripe. i really liked that the whole bodice was lined with a sewn-in lining from neck to hem (minus the sleeves). i would have loved the dress overall but my usual size small was snug at the hips and it would have just made me too self-conscious for that reason. sadly  i have to return mine  but i would certainly recommend the style for someone with slim hips ,1,Dresses

Really beautiful skirt. unique print (red) and stylish. keep in mind this is knit  stretchy  form fitting. as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric. i purchased a large (i am 5'7 and 154lbs) and don't like skirts too tight so i sized up. the large is fine however  i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesn't quite fit as slim as i would like. i suspect the m would be better. if you have a stomach it will show! i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on,1,Skirts
I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized  so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust  which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that  especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit.     the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w,1,Knits

I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three! the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique. the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and it's a great color for summer. i'm waiting for the white to arrive and hope it's actually white and not ivory  as retailer colors are sometime a little off. i'm petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream. not too tight or loose  super comfortable and flattering. easy to pair with white  khaki ,1,Knits
I have been looking for a cold shoulder dress for a while  but haven't been able to find anything i really liked. i ordered this and picked it up at the local store. it is very comfortable and seemed a little big at first  so i washed and dried it and it seemed to shrink just a little to fit well. i love the open shoulders. i wore it with gray tights and gray boots for valentine's day and it was perfect for the cold winter weather. i think it is a bit overpriced  but i still love it! it's a nice,1,Dresses
I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it  there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....,1,Dresses
This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim  but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior  the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.,1,Jackets
I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it  it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy,1,Dresses

I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large  it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.,1,Knits
I ordered a size xl in the pink version with the multi-colored fabric. the fit is true to size other than the length. it isn't 27 inches. it's the petite length even though i ordered the regular sizing. i ordered a 2nd one and again  the length was around 25 in. instead of 27. so  it will be more of a swingy  shorter top than shown. but  through the arms/body  it's true-to-size. i'll be dry-cleaning this so it won't shrink since i need the length.    the colors and embroidery are exactly as pict,1,Blouses

Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips  butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!,1,Jeans

These are pretty good high-rise jeans--probably the best you'll find for the price. they're all one color  no whisking or fading  so they look dressier than your average jeans  and the cut through the leg is bone straight  which i think flatters most body shapes. i agree with the other reviewers--they are tight. i got these in a 25  my usual size  and they squeeze my belly. i probably could've sized up  but i'm waiting to see if they stretch out the way most levi's do.,1,Jeans

This top is beautiful. the cutout portion extends below the bust  but is intricate enough to look good with a black bra or exciting with  say  a taupe or grey one. the fit across the shoulders is snug  but the rest of the top is very voluminous. don't expect to tuck this swamp thing in. it's a bit of an odd contrast  but if you're prepared to wear something that is itself a beautiful object  even if it doesn't really make sense for a human body... this is it.,1,Knits

This blouse is made out of a high-quality material  flows beautifully  and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference  size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.,1,Blouses

I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.,1,Knits
In the photo  this looks like a heavy knit top  but it's not. the fabric is very light  thin  and soft. it's like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so  to me  you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.    the front criss-crosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement. the two fabric pieces sort of,1,Knits
It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.,1,Skirts
I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small  i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly  so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint.,1,Blouses
"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand  but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame  yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely  and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting.",1,Knits
This is all around  a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least)  but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs  but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.,1,Blouses
This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.,1,Lounge
This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.  the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly  i tried the medium as well  and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference ,1,Knits

I got this top in the black floral print. the print is very pretty and so is the neckline  but the body is very loose and shapeless. it's not flattering. i think the shirt is a little too short as well. it would be nicer if it was longer. nevertheless  it is a pretty top.,1,Knits
This is the perfect dress to transition into fall  either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand  ranna gill  but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price  i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.,1,Dresses

I got this top in green and i'm overall happy with it. i agree with the other reviewers that the material is thin and the quality not top notch and it certainly is overpriced for what it is (especially with the shipping fee). however the style is really cute  love the lace up in the back and if flows nicely without billowing as is the case with so many retailer swing tops lately.  i didn't find it to be so see through that it would need a cami (at least not the green color) and a nude strapless br,1,Knits
This dress is very pretty in person  and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable  and the length is perfect. for reference  i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses  and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size  it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large  but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist  so i would say it fits true to size for me  but w,1,Dresses

Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived  it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!,1,Jeans

This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking  that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck ,1,Sweaters
I bought a xs in black. i like the weight  texture  and thickness of this fabric. it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well. may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch  which could mean there are inconsistencies? i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes. it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length. but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale.,1,Legwear

Listen to all the reviews  size down! i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty  i was wrong!!! i could camp out in the large! it was super large!!!    got the medium and its fit amazingly! its a tad bit tight in the chest(barely tight) but im a 38dd and this is not an unusual thing for. i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect! cant wait to wear it! loving the velvet trend this fall! thinking about getting the blue too!,1,Dresses

This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi,1,Dresses

This si=hirt actually has a shimmer to the fabric. it is more of sweatshirt material but i like the thickness  not too thick not too thin. the color is nice in person  and has a shimmer to it. i like the detail in the neck too with the sequins. reason i didn't get it is it felt a little big on me (smallest is xs) and also the color wasn't optimal (i am rather pale). otherwise  i do like the shirt.,1,Knits

This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it's a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i don't think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.,1,Dresses

I agree with the other reviewer -- it's refreshing to find a top that isn't all baggy or sheer  which seems to be the current trend right now.  _______  pros:  - lots of stretch. this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable.  - the ruched detailing  sleeves and overall length is great.  - no cami needed with the white. i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath. i wrote a nude bra and didn't have an issue at the front because it's two la,1,Knits

This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl  and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color  or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).,1,Dresses

Love the simple non-fussy style of this dress. note that the color is not ivory  as described and expected (not the first time retailer makes that mistake)  however i still found the oatmealish-warm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone (warm tones look best on me). like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless  gives it a dressier feel. the fine texture is lovely. this does drape up top  while the bottom clings a bit  but not overly much for me to feel immodest. i am 5,1,Dresses

These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.,1,Pants

Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin  lightweight  and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..,1,Blouses
"Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest  broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price  a fun boho transition piece!  it is a ""reverse print"" so the inside is brighter than the outside  but i like the blurred paisley print--it's subtle.    the back detail is great and very flattering.    it is quite full and flowy  but in a flattering way  i think. just restrained enough.",1,Knits
I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking  but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!,1,Knits
This top is overall very flattering! i am petite but large chested and the small fits great in the front  although it bunches a little bit in the back where the tag is - i think because of the crossing straps but nothing that will gender me from wearing it. i got the pink and i do wish it were a little more pink - it's so light that it almost looks white. overall i am happy with this sale purchase!,1,Knits

I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm. i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flattering-the longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isn't just straight but it has that little flair-this is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan (unless it is short all the way around) and it was great attention to detail by the designer. i like the,1,Knits

Dressed up or dressed down  this summer dress is perfect. the skirt is a lot of fabric  like others have said  but it's part of what makes this dress fun; and because the top is fitted  i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted. that being said  the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable; at first it looked like a sack  but when it's on and adjusted it will l,1,Dresses

The cut on this is fantastic  every color way is vibrant and appealing. length just skims over where my hips broaden  which is nice  and my shoulders look strong and tan. however. i prefer cotton  or at least a cotton blend. this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks  the colors will never fade  and the shape won't change. i find the man made fabric very very hot  though.,1,Knits
Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah! no seriously  it's like a 10-yr old tee soft! the colors aren't even close compared to online  though. the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color. i didn't see the lilac in the store.,1,Knits

These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants  definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.,1,Lounge

The best thing about these pants is the material. if you are expecting a bleached denim-material  these are not for you. these are far better. they are extremely soft and have some give to them but not so much that they stretch out while wearing them (as guaranteed on the tag). although  because they are a less rigid material  the pants do show stretching as can be seen at the knee area in the photo. if you normally get short-sized pants  the regular fit will fit like regular non-ankle pants but,1,Jeans

Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.,1,Blouses

I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything. as another reviewer noted  some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart. not something acceptable at this price point.  unlike her  this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily  for weeks and feel like the buttons  trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft  warm and cl,1,Sweaters
I wanted to like this top so badly because it has so many interesting pieces to the blouse. ultimately i didn't keep this because of the bell sleeves  and the pattern going across the body just wasn't flattering on my full figure. i went down a size to help reduce the amount of fabric draping in the back  but it didn't make up for the pattern that i just didn't like. if you are interested in this blouse  i recommend it because it might work out for someone with a different figure than mine,1,Knits

I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet  the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.,1,Swim
These pants fit great  true to size  heavy enough to withstand winter  and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw.,1,Pants
Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown  but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition  this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering  not too tight  but shows just enough of your curves  physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium,1,Skirts
I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .     one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you  these are not the pants,1,Pants
This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have   a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material   like cotton versus polyester  but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.,1,Dresses

I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall  the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.,1,Blouses
"I am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally don't mind lose and flowing. however  this dress is very ""bell"" shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesn't really lay well  at least not like it does in the photo. i bought the earth-tone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell. it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting. if it weren't so short  i would try sizing down. it is very good quality and the slip is super soft",1,Dresses
"I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall  (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself.",1,Dresses
This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.,1,Skirts
I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.,1,Jeans

This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid  and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah  it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  hem falls 4 inches above my knees  sleeves fall right at my wrist  and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat  horse print is so cute.,1,Sweaters
I wish this came in a petite size! i'm going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i'm busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium.,1,Swim
This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice  as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.,1,Dresses

This blouse in the purple motif is lovely. unfortunately for me  it runs small.,1,Blouses
Love the style of this dress (length  hem  waist details  material)! i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around. it doesn't give the entire waist definition  which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist. this is a pretty unique dress  which is one of the reasons i liked it. i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps. unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea,1,Dresses

This is what a bathing suit should look and feel like. no crawling up the cheeks :) no spillage out the front. i would say it's true to size or a little on the large size. i'm 5'4 122 and ordered a medium which was great for me. maybe a small would have been ok but i couldn't be happier. good job! color is true to the pic. quality seems nice and sturdy.,1,Swim

This swing dress is very cute and easy to wear. i ordered the orange print and the black because i couldn't decide. the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper. i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large. the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small. even still there is a lot of extra fabric. the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta,1,Dresses

I'm in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i'm so glad i purchased it  it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures  but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it  but glad i didn't. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high  and it probably wouldn't have shown. the wool material is very fine  not scratchy  and a bit stretchy,1,Trend

I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality  and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8  but my store only had a 4 available. it fit  but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model  but i'm on the short side.,1,Skirts

This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy  just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.,1,Trend

This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit  and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!,1,Knits
This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette  so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand  and,1,Jackets

Cute skirt and print  but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture  but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.,1,Skirts

Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great  it's not too clingy and it's flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass).,1,Dresses
The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide  but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops  but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium  my normal size.,1,Knits

I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while  and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves  worn long  are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn't exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used  but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th,1,Dresses

Ok  so by now  we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce  i am 5'7  about 120  and xs was the best fit.  but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low  and it survived just fine!,1,Knits

As other reviewers said  this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big  ordered a size down  & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally  i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra,1,Knits

This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size  which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however  this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight,1,Intimates
I've bought similar blouses from retailer before that i didn't love as much as this. it's not boxy or wide on me. it's a great length and i find the 3/4 bell sleeves to be elegant. i bought the purple one on sale and went back for the red/cream. my only complaint would be that the stitching could be of better quality. the fabric is very nice -- love the print.,1,Blouses

The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.,1,Sweaters

You can't exactly tell from the picture  but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom  and it really adds interest to the whole piece. i think my favorite part about this dress  though  is the weightiness of the skirt--it's not so heavy that it's hot or uncomfortable  but enough that it feels more quality  more special.,1,Dresses

I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,1,Blouses
This dress is very pretty  versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up  i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite  this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable.

Really cute version of a sweatshirt. fits true to size through the shoulders and bust line; however  since i am larger in the bust area than the hip  the lower half of the top looks slightly large on my body. the sweatshirt is cut very straight  so it would probably flatter a person with a pear or straight shape. the inside material of the sweatshirt is a little rough; however  the appliquã© design makes this shirt a keeper.,1,Knits
I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.,1,Blouses
I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders  and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however  it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed  and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest)  and as i head,1,Swim
I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!,1,Dresses
This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery  colors  crochet lace  tassels  wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.,1,Dresses

I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless  the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person  shorter tops look best.,1,Knits

This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation  but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that  like many byron lars sheath dresses  the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t,1,Dresses

I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white  and it's not too see through  which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2)  it tends to be a bit long  but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes  best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of,1,Knits

I love this dress. based on reviews  i ordered the small  and the only problem i had was that  while the dress is quite large  the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted  which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own  and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool  but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!,1,Dresses

"Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick  but not heavy  and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice  but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th",1,Knits
I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,1,Knits

If you've been searching for red crops  gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model  but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin  really stretchy (in a good way)  and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet  so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!,1,Pants

I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!,1,Knits
I'm an xl in all retailer tops  and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely; i don't like to wear tight clothes. having said that  i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large. the sleeves hang a bit odd if you don't get the correct size. i love the feel of the blouse  the fabric is a nice quality. i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse.,1,Knits

First  the product arrived in a very small bag that made for many  many wrinkles - almost impossible to determine what it might look like. shame on retailer for sending their items in this manner. secondly  i don't know how individuals wear this with a bra. the back is cut so low that my bra back band partially showed - not my idea of a good look. third  the front necessitated a cami  and there is no way a cami can be worn due to how it is cut in the back. returning now  and i just received it.,1,Knits

I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer  but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.,1,Dresses

Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual  asymmetrical seam that appears along the front  right-hand side of the garment.

The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern  i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange  short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.,1,Knits
I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price  but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing  and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust  and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.,1,Swim

These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit  classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming  but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot)  or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day  roll them up for ca,1,Pants
I had been looking for a tee to wear under a kimono i bought last year at retailer. the cut out slub tee was the perfect tee. the slate color goes well with the colors in the kimono  along with being a good neutral. this is also a good tee to wear alone with a pair of jeans as it hangs nicely.,1,Knits
I really had high hopes for this sweater however  unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be. i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really don't feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard. first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft. secondly  the actual knit also appears to be very cheap. i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits  i really can't see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m,1,Sweaters
Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area  some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh  what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty  so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.,1,Dresses

A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,1,Intimates

I did like the dress  but don't love it. i think it would have been better for me if it were snugger. the xxs petite was still loose and i found that there are so many dresses with the similar fit  i decided to pass... i also do like both colors  the brown is a better choice for me on my skin tone (warmer)  but both are nice. i am 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,1,Dresses

Versatile and flattering. i don't order many clothes online because i'm a tough fit and need to try on first  but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk. i love the high waisted  vintage style and the length is perfect. the bold color is fun. the little details are even better- navy blue piping  the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back. great skirt.,1,Skirts

Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer,1,Dresses

I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing  but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red. it is as depicted  and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy  but the regular size fits slightly too big on me. this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise. i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available. nonetheless  the fabric is substantial enough that it doesn't show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach  so i'm keeping it.,1,Knits

You have to try it on to see  it fits really well and looks stylish. i love it.  my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy  not sure if it will hold up well in the long run.,1,Pants
"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all  although the shorts fit fine around my waist.",1,Shorts
I purchased this dress off the reviews.unfortunately i have to return it. i expected it to fit as they said. i am 5'1'- 120 lbs. 35/b-c. i got the s petite. i could not even get this dress on over my chest. the waist was on top of my chest.   i really was disappointed . the material is so soft  i would have had to purchase a m in a regular to fit me. and it would have looked terrible on me. so  i would say  for a tall thin girl   yes   a short girl a no. and i am very petite.,1,Dresses
Super cute pants  fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist  and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however  when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them.,1,Jeans

Unlike the other reviews  i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material  as is the eyelet overlay  making it a really easy to wear  and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.     i bought it so that its slim fitting  more like a pencil skirt.   i've only worn it to work dressed up  with boots  but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt.   i highly recommend it  and think it's a great price.   it is longer than on the mode,1,Skirts
Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale  but not before that.,1,Blouses
From the online pics  i would never think to try this on  but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets  so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up  almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.,1,Dresses

"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric  and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless  i love this dress and would definitely recommend!",1,Dresses
What a delight of a dress! i saw it online and it piqued my interest in person too. with only one size available  i was limited to try on a dress two sizes too small  so i've factored that in to my review. the dress is very light and would be see through without the attached slip. the length fell just above my ankle with the design allowing for a movement and flow to the bottom. the colors are vibrant in person  perhaps even more so than online. the fit seems to be true to size  though i have to,1,Dresses

This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.,1,Pants

This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it  is the three buttons in the back at the top are very  very difficult to button.,1,Blouses

I was so sad to have to return these pilcro jeans. my calves are just too athletic for these jeans. they weren't comfortable. they were a little loose in the waist. so  sizing up  would not have fit the tight in the calves problem. i have two pairs of stetson crop flares and they fit perfectly. in fact i love the pilcro stetson crop flare style. wish retailer would sell more of this style.,1,Jeans

When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person  it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4  but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected  considering i have a 32dd bust  but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes  even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders  so maybe that,1,Blouses

I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me  although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit  more fitted on top at the bust  shoulders and sleeves  and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric  though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.,1,Blouses

Loved this top! bought it during the recent promo and thought the sale price more fair. i sized up because i wanted a swing-ier silhouette and more room at the neckline. the top is impeccably made and the embroidery is sturdy. i did not find the top see-thru and am wearing it with a racer back black bra and have no issues.,1,Blouses
This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats  etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.,1,Fine gauge

These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly  i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer  and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size  they are adorable!,1,Pants

Well  it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too  and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev,1,Fine gauge

This dress is gorgeous  but if you have a larger bust size  i would not recommend it. unfortunately  it was not available in any nearby stores and i had to order online. the low cut looks cute on the model but realistically with a chest it ends up looking a bit too revealing. i am bummed because the dress really is beautiful!!,1,Dresses

This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with  it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.,1,Knits

This is m frist pair of flares  and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed  but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly  but combined with the flare  the high waist is,1,Jeans
"This midi skirt arrived and i tried it on immediately. the fit was perfect and i wanted it badly enough to say that it would balance my 5'5"" height and 135 lbs. if i just wore a higher heel shoe. then i saw the grey lining showing from the back of the skirt through the scalloped front. it's a beautiful skirt  flows nicely and could be flattering on a taller person who can forgive a poorly designed lining. i would recommend giving it a try.",1,Skirts

Love this top  the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim  love hte colors  but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.  sizing is true to size  i tried on the regular size  not petite  and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2  went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit  2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial  the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr  with navy  but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!,1,Blouses

So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft  and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5'5   125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won't regret. also   finally - perfect length .,1,Sleep
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.,1,Pants

I tried this on today because when i touched it  it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange  it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace  but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said  it was very comfortable and soft,1,Dresses

Beautiful dress  but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.,1,Dresses
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,1,Jeans
"One of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and don't like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist. i like this skirt because of its stretchiness. even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at all.    received many compliments including: ""you look like you're vacating in the caribbean!""",1,Skirts

This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable  breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love  although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white  which is fine  but that did surprise me a little. overall  i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.,1,Skirts

The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,1,Dresses
"I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger  but once i tried it on  i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy  and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress!

"This is as beautiful in person as online  but the length is shorter than the description  and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1""  i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however  the 28"" length scared me off  so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25"" long  but it's actually just about 24"". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card  so i will keep :-)",1,Blouses
I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front. i liked it  but sometimes items are different when you get them. this shirt was as pictured! the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think it's probably one of the nicer designs available. the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. also  some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here. t,1,Knits

I like this shirt because it can be worn for dressy or casual. i like the weight although i wish it was just a tad less see-through. i can get by without wearing a tank under but i usually feel like i have to wear one. i like the link. i feel like it runs just a little large. i love the length of the sleeves and the detail/cut of the sleeve. i like the colors on the shirt too. it's a good  versatile addition to my wardrobe!,1,Knits
The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress.   the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch  i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.    this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines,1,Dresses
I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately  i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab  this might not be a great choice for you.,1,Dresses
Love these! i'm about 5'4  and they fit right at the ankle. the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans. i've worn them several times  and they haven't stretched out at all. perfect for spring.,1,Jeans
"I ordered this online expecting more of a heavier sweater. its really more like a t-shirt which is actually fine. its super comfortable and it's really cute. my only complaint is that it is pretty short. i'm 5'7"" and i would love it if it were just an inch or two longer in the torso. other than that it's a great shirt.",1,Knits
The green is terrific  and the pleat in the back makes the top flows nicely. great if you have some muffin top to hide (like me). and the details across the shoulders and back makes it more interesting than just a t. i'm concern about the quality of fabric. lately there's much rayon mix and they tend to pill or wear out and get holes after washing.,1,Knits
"I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small  which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be ""flowy"" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute  but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.",1,Dresses
Like the other reviewers  i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body  so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets,1,Dresses
This dress is a fun idea- but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat- it threw the lines of the dress off. i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo.,1,Dresses
This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size  and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life  it's more like distressed charcoal gray)  and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual  and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer  being long in the torso. even going down a size  the length is great. overall  i like that t,1,Knits

This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small  fitting as it does on the model. it's a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t,1,Blouses

I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom - i will be returning both for a s. the fabric is great and a cool pattern  but it runs large by far. in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger. i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering - i am about 5'11'' and it hits below my knees  similar to the model in the picture  so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side. it's al,1,Skirts

I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.,1,Dresses
I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces).     unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the,1,Knits

I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.,1,Skirts
The prints are very cute and flattering and the material is thick. i'm 5'2 107lb and 32c and got the xsp  my usual size. the shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly  the neckline is a little low (questionable for work). the fit however is off on the waist -- which is not as pictured. it is more of an empire waist ad barely even clears my boobs  so i doubt even a regular xs will change this much. it isnt a flattering look on my frame altho the prints hide it somewhat  except from the side view. also ,1,Dresses

If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat  i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful  fits like a glove. i got the size 4  went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2  so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful.,1,Outerwear
"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model)  which never happens! great quality  thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",1,Pants
This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.,1,Sweaters
This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute  but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med  34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm.,1,Knits
Based on the reviews of others  i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8  so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer  or boots in the winter.,1,Dresses
The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy  comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.  i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on.,1,Fine gauge
The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.,1,Sweaters
Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice  i am a sucker for flowers  i also love the cut of it  teh tiered hem is very flatering  not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra  and the whole dress is super flowey  substantial amterial  and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom  gives it a nice shape). i can't say anything bad about this.     regular xs fit me but i would ahve t,1,Dresses

"I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly  however i'm concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5'3"" tall  120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose.",1,Knits
36dd  10/12 in tops  12/14 in bottoms  bought size m/l very cute pattern on the grey leggings  and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too  so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug  but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.,1,Legwear
This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.,1,Fine gauge
"I'm a sucker for lace details that dress up an otherwise plain white shirt. the shoulder and sleeve lace is well done on this top  and the cut is flattering  skimming over the body. i appreciated that the product notes included the length  as i ordered a petite s (i'm 5'4""  120 lbs) and the fit was perfect. a regular s would have been too long for me. the fabric is soft and fluid. i wish it were a little more substantial  but that's a minor quibble.",1,Knits
Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.,1,Blouses
"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3""  36dd  athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim  dark denim  and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate  and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze",1,Knits

This piece was really great for summer. you can wear it dressed up or down. i wore it over another green retailer dress with wedges. i usually never layer clothes but it just made sense. i love it?,1,Sweaters
The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing  you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.,1,Blouses
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys  the 27 fits very comfortably.     i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",1,Jeans
Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4.,1,Dresses
This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality  i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.,1,Pants
I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me  the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length  it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but  overall  it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ,1,Knits

"As other reviewers have mentioned  this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a ""swingy"" and ""airy"" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig",1,Dresses
Thank goodness i looked at everyone's reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it wouldn't have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!,1,Dresses
I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall  great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.,1,Sweaters

This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves  love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted  body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.,1,Dresses

Love this blazer! combines a chic  pulled together look with super soft  comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl  so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium  but didn't want to deal with the back and forth again.,1,Jackets
"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut  but i lov",1,Knits
This dress can be dressed up or down. it looks cute w/ a black open sweater and looks great alone. the fabric is very soft. although it isn't fitted  it doesn't have too much material either  so it is very flattering on. the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look. the pockets are nice and light inside. i usually wear a 10/12 and the large fit perfectly. i was also lucky to get it on sale ;),1,Dresses

Overall  gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes  which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe,1,Blouses
I ordered this tunic in xl and it fits me true to size. it's such a fun piece to wear. i like all of the embroidery which was done in beautiful colors and stitched well. the different fabric and the cut make this a very flattering top. i tie in the green and pink in my jewelry and sweaters when i wear this. it's so comfortable too. i'll get good use out of this top for winter. i like the uniqueness of it.,1,Knits
"A lovely skirt and i'm so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that  i expected the medium to run small and that i'd have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it's not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small  which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you'd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i'm 5'6"" which is tall enough fo",1,Skirts

I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's 2 layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an,1,Dresses
