"I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5"" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5"" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!",0,Pants
I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning!,0,Blouses
The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.,0,Dresses
After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black,0,Dresses
The fabric is very nice on this wrap  but it wears like a blanket.,0,Sweaters
I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits  but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it  but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit  i will be returning this dress.,0,Dresses
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",0,Sweaters
These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it,0,Pants
I only tried on the ivory one  but it was so see-through  there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size  maybe a little large  but that's the style. very cute design  loved the back. too bad.,0,Knits
These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.,0,Shorts
Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i'm not. going back.,0,Knits
This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however  only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say  i'm returning it.,0,Dresses
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,0,Fine gauge
This skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large. i am a size 4  xs in retailer. my waist is 28 inches  5'7  140 pounds. the skirt is touching the floor. even if i wear high heels  i will have to wear it up my waist. the elastic band is weak  not sure if it will hold the skirt. it should be ok with a belt. i still recommend it cause it's so pretty.,0,Skirts
This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.,0,Blouses
"Like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well  i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo  although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms)  and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small  which is what",0,Dresses
They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.,0,Pants
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.,0,Knits
As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.,0,Blouses
"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",0,Jackets
"When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very",0,Blouses
I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.,0,Dresses
On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.,0,Dresses
Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,0,Jackets
Love the style and fit  but it does stretch out during wear. by the end of the day  it feels big.,0,Knits
"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!",0,Fine gauge
I wanted to love these pants  but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.,0,Pants
"While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to""  unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame  however  the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra.",0,Dresses
"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav",0,Knits
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it,0,Knits
Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.,0,Knits
I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also  it runs small and was tight.,0,Dresses
This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!,0,Lounge
Very cute dress  just way too big. i ordered it online  wish i would have gone a size smaller.,0,Dresses
This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.,0,Dresses
"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",0,Intimates
"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it.",0,Swim
"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo",0,Trend
I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7  115 lbs  wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish  but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately  when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester  and while it's machine washable (yay)  i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily  and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price  so i returned it.,0,Dresses
"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2""  103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well  but instead of looking slouchy and cool  it just looked too big. so  back it goes.",0,Blouses
This sweater was pretty short. beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.,0,Knits
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,0,Knits
It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.,0,Knits
I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer  but will never again buy another sweater here.,0,Fine gauge
I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8  got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.,0,Sweaters
Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;),0,Blouses

Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel,0,Dresses
I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c,0,Blouses

I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.,0,Jeans
"Okay  i love the blouse this brand has in the same material  so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7"" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this  usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist  and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose  and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my",0,Dresses

I loved the look of this top when i saw it online  however  when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful  but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!,0,Knits

I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress,0,Dresses

I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo,0,Dresses
I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment  like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips  typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before  and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li,0,Blouses

I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.,0,Trend
I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however  some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also  it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture  it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as,0,Sweaters
The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,0,Swim
I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses

I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.,0,Dresses
"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.",0,Knits
I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.,0,Knits

I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange  without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful  however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath  but it is so sheer you need something.,0,Dresses

Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s,0,Blouses
Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses

So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!,0,Dresses

"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",0,Jackets

I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,0,Sweaters

There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,0,Blouses

The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,0,Swim

I wanted to love this top  but had 2 major problems with it. first  it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt  which was terribly unflattering. second  the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.,0,Knits
I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,0,Blouses

While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must.

This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha,0,Dresses
I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful  intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt  with the shirt getting wider and more,0,Knits
Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft  true fit  and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.',0,Knits
The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge  it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.,0,Knits
Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess.,0,Blouses

Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.,0,Dresses
If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of,0,Skirts

While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!),0,Swim

This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat,0,Knits
Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.,0,Blouses

Initially  i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.,0,Outerwear
"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me.",0,Blouses
"What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif.  no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned  for reference i'm 5'2"" 107 lbs average proportions.",0,Dresses
I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are,0,Jeans

In the photo  this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7  always take a size medium but on me  the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button  it stretches and looks terrible. in the back  it falls short. it's going back.,0,Sweaters

I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.,0,Knits
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0,Intimates
Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock,0,Knits
I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work  but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.,0,Sweaters
I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.,0,Dresses
Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.    the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess.     looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders  but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also  front b,0,Dresses

I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress it really is so pretty but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly the cut is not right for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection,0,Dresses

I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried,0,Dresses

I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,0,Jackets

I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.,0,Knits

Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured  which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips  so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure  but wasn't amazing for me.,0,Blouses
The colors on this top are beautiful  even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work  back it goes.,0,Knits
Online  this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact  i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.,0,Fine gauge
These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle. i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift.,0,Pants
The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.,0,Lounge

Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,0,Shorts
Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer,0,Blouses

This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).,0,Knits

I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,0,Jackets

I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,0,Dresses

The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.,0,Blouses

I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge

The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts
I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side  across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser  i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.,0,Dresses

This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,0,Dresses

I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma,0,Blouses
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,0,Jackets

The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a,0,Dresses
So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.,0,Pants

I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!,0,Knits

This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...,0,Dresses
This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,0,Skirts
These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it,0,Pants

Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.,0,Dresses

This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,0,Skirts

This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.,0,Blouses
I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3  it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough  it should work for you!,0,Knits

This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.,0,Dresses
This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it'll be retailer. but now i,0,Dresses

"I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s",0,Dresses

I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however  if you are chesty  this piece shows off more than i was comfy with  and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body  i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top  the xs showed much too much cleavage.

This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person  though the back was gorgeous  with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online  but was a bit more green in person. also  the armholes were very low  so it would need a camisole or no bra.,0,Knits

Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.,0,Dresses

Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,0,Dresses

This t is a beautiful color  and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy  however - very thin cotton fabric  without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips so instead of covering them  it highlights them. i'm disappointed  and am returning it.,0,Knits
Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,0,Skirts
I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.,0,Lounge
As much as i had wanted this to work for me  it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.,0,Knits
I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!,0,Pants
"This top is cute  but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs  but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2""  110 lbs  34a). even worse  though  was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined  so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy  and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt  but not worth actually wearing.",0,Knits

I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses

This is such a beautiful top with pretty  vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine  the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back  with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!  so sad to have to return this one.,0,Knits

I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.,0,Blouses
I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,0,Jackets

From the photos  i thought the design was embroidered. in reality  it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.,0,Sweaters

Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.,0,Dresses
Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.,0,Knits
The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t,0,Fine gauge
I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,0,Legwear

These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,0,Sleep

If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.,0,Sweaters

I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.,0,Sweaters

I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful  plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.,0,Knits

I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,0,Dresses

I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.,0,Knits

I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,0,Intimates

I really wanted to like his dress  but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts  so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall  it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.,0,Dresses
It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.,0,Dresses

This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,0,Intimates

I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.,0,Blouses
I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.,0,Dresses
The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.,0,Dresses

This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl,0,Knits
This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress  which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.,0,Dresses

I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.,0,Lounge

This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?,0,Outerwear

I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog  but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.,0,Outerwear

It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.,0,Blouses

Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,0,Outerwear
I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.,0,Knits

This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute,0,Blouses
This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.,0,Blouses
I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.,0,Knits

The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.,0,Dresses

I want to love this shirt  i really do  but it's huge! the top is tent-like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly  it's a return.,0,Knits

Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses

I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.,0,Dresses

The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,0,Jeans

This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.,0,Dresses

When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected  especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse  but i will be returning it becau,0,Blouses

The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.,0,Knits

This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer  but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress  but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so  i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said  if the company were to try again ne,0,Dresses

I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi,0,Fine gauge

I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.,0,Sweaters
I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.,0,Knits

I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty  it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute  lacy bandeau bra  the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad  since it is a cute top  and well made.,0,Knits

In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th,0,Dresses

I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on,0,Knits

I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately  even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall  it's a cute dress but just not for me.,0,Dresses
I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.,0,Lounge

I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.,0,Dresses

I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this,0,Dresses
I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,0,Lounge

No  but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8  a size 6 on top  8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online  but i saw this on naomi's blog  love taza  and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer  and while they only had a m/l  since i'm tall  i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like  it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model  and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well  so just looks  huuuge. i thought i was bein,0,Knits
Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...,0,Blouses
This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se,0,Dresses
I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba,0,Outerwear
The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,0,Shorts
"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",0,Shorts

This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l  so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge  i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large  and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is  it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture.

"First off  the dress quality is great  the fabric is very nice  the color is great. i am 5'4""  150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me  very unattractive  because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant.",0,Dresses
After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second  the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo  and the fabric felt cheap. finally  it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.,0,Dresses
I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of,0,Lounge

I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,0,Blouses

I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.,0,Blouses
I was really eager to receive this sweater  i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new  it is mostly shapeless  it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col,0,Sweaters
I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would,0,Blouses
Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).,0,Jeans

I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true  it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.,0,Dresses
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).,0,Pants
I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,0,Dresses
Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.,0,Pants
Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all,0,Dresses

I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c,0,Lounge
I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.,0,Pants
I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi,0,Jackets

The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,0,Dresses

Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.,0,Swim
I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,0,Blouses
Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on  which is a first. was very cute in theory  but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).,0,Swim
This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.,0,Dresses
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0,Knits
I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.,0,Fine gauge

I've been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale. the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it! this will be going back to the store!!!!,0,Dresses
Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.,0,Dresses
This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.,0,Knits
I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.,0,Pants
I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs,0,Knits

Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large  but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far  i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos  the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he,0,Blouses

I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however  while i liked the irregular hemline on the model  on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern  definitely no dryer on this one.,0,Knits
Online this top looks fabulous  but in person  not so great. great color  nice quality for a lightweight top  but when i tried it on  the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found  for me  it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest  so didn't work. for reference  i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal,0,Knits

Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length  too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering  particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person  way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.,0,Knits
This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,0,Skirts

I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this,0,Knits
I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning,0,Skirts

This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,0,Skirts
I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.,0,Skirts

The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,0,Knits

Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses

I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.,0,Dresses

These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent,0,Pants
I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.,0,Dresses

Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.,0,Blouses

I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere  more so than i thought it would be. but the neck  there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top  material is so-so.,0,Knits

I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,0,Lounge

The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric,0,Knits

I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0,Pants

I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,0,Fine gauge

I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.,0,Dresses

I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.,0,Dresses
The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,0,Jackets

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.,0,Dresses
Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,0,Blouses
This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,0,Pants

I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h)  so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top  i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine  but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is  it is very cute otherwise! i just mail,0,Knits

Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses

At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,0,Jackets

Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.,0,Blouses
I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,0,Jackets

Wonderful pencil skirt with subtle design to pair with a variety of tops or sweaters. fabric is nice and has a true 'fitted' design. however  the sizing is all off. it runs small and too long. i'm 5'3 and wait 25/26 in denim and a 2-4p in most skirts. the 4 is too tight and past the knee in length. more like upper calf. the 6 would be way too long. disappointed.,0,Skirts

This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.,0,Blouses
Beautiful dress  but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off  i definitely don't!,0,Dresses

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

After seeing the picture online  i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it  but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big  but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to,0,Blouses
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,0,Dresses

I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.,0,Dresses

I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0,Dresses
This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,0,Fine gauge

Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.,0,Dresses

I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,0,Skirts

Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.,0,Knits
This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.,0,Skirts
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.,0,Knits
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer  and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly  but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money  i could get it tailored  but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!,0,Dresses

"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.",0,Jeans
The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.,0,Dresses

"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house  so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews  it runs big in some areas  something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also  the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry  i think of pink or red  this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we",0,Knits
"This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said ""wow that's very elegant"". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality",0,Sweaters
I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times  hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.,0,Blouses
I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!,0,Blouses
I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.,0,Pants
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.,0,Knits

I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,0,Intimates
This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.,0,Blouses
I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.,0,Dresses
Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same  the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length  however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip)  but the overlay comes down way past my,0,Dresses

This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to,0,Trend

I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately  it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and  it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly  it is going back.,0,Dresses

I bought the orange in xxs petite  and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.    i like a swing style  but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer  and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.,0,Blouses
I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...,0,Knits

I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.,0,Fine gauge
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.,0,Dresses
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.,0,Knits

Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!,0,Pants

The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,0,Dresses
"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high  the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally  the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits  and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt  given the pretty steep price.",0,Skirts
I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).,0,Blouses

I was hoping to love this tunic  but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute  but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately  it has to go back.,0,Knits
I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!,0,Dresses
This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size  the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it  too  is defective,0,Dresses

After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m  i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend  unless you wear 3xxxl,0,Knits
Overall  a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust  to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy  so i'd stay away if you are petite  with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.,0,Knits
The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price  i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.,0,Skirts
I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny  thin  and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline,0,Dresses

Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.,0,Sweaters
Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so  i have bought 3 new pairs  and all have been so disappointing. first of all  the quality is horrible now. in the past  they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened  pilcro?!?!?,0,Jeans
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.,0,Sweaters

Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,0,Jackets
This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor  though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric  while soft and comfortable  is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears  the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.,0,Shorts

I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.,0,Knits
So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.,0,Dresses

I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,0,Swim

As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.,0,Dresses

This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.,0,Knits

This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0,Blouses

For the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent. the style is cute  but nothing more. however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.  the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.  no need to say - it's going back asap.  you should not sel,0,Dresses
I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.,0,Blouses

Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,0,Skirts
I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall  i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...,0,Blouses
I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but  the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.,0,Sweaters
The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.,0,Blouses
While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.,0,Knits

At the beginning of summer  i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft  open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately  even though these are made of mesh  these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas  new york  new jersey  and florida. i thought they'd be a good  pretty choice. but  the material with the gathered waist & wrists  trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer,0,Knits

I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t,0,Dresses

This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.,0,Dresses

I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress,0,Dresses
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.,0,Sweaters
I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.,0,Jeans
This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said  this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.,0,Dresses

Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures  and it has a lovely quality in person  the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on  and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips  large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.,0,Dresses

I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.,0,Jeans

This top may be right for some  but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however  it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl  but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big.     the quality is great and style so pretty  though. i wish it had worked for me!,0,Knits
Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they  firstly  aren't eloise like i assumed they would be  and secondly  that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure  but i'm,0,Sleep

I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.,0,Dresses

This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.,0,Dresses

I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.,0,Dresses
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer,0,Skirts
The skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately  the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.,0,Blouses
First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a,0,Pants

Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits

The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought,0,Sweaters
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.,0,Dresses

As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0,Skirts
I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.,0,Blouses

I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however  the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in.  and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material  i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress  even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.,0,Dresses
I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.,0,Dresses
I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress  but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin  taller person.,0,Dresses
It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.,0,Sweaters

This blouse runs large  billows out slightly  and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty  the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless  i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.,0,Knits
I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it's going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it's high quality. just wish the fit was better.,0,Dresses

This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!,0,Dresses
I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual  white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!,0,Blouses

Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.,0,Dresses
Gorgeous fun dress  but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra  but i think its a winner for someone.,0,Dresses
"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.",0,Dresses
The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,0,Skirts

I must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for.  i adored it online and even on the hanger.  putting it on  it just looked frumpy on me (i tried my usual small first).  decided i must need a smaller size  so i sized down to an xs.  this one looked much better on  but was nearly impossible to get in and out of  the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice).  i decided i wasn't willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it.  i passed.,0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.,0,Pants
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,0,Knits
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses
I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.,0,Knits
Ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans,0,Dresses

I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.,0,Dresses

I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.,0,Dresses

Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed  all the way around  perhaps purposely  but ratty looking  all the same.,0,Lounge
I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!,0,Pants
I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.,0,Swim
I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.,0,Blouses

I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,0,Intimates

As another reviewer mentioned  maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4  and while it fits  i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared  but also short  making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable  i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don,0,Blouses

This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0,Dresses
Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.,0,Pants

Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.,0,Blouses

I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b,0,Dresses

I wasn't sure i would like this top  but wanted something different  than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric  i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference  i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.,1,Knits
I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine  without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist  but it's still very flattering.,1,Dresses

Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much  were too thin  but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss  and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though  so i may keep both.,1,Jeans

I bought this dress for an early fall wedding  i usually wear a size 14 and bought a large. it was loose and swingy  very comfortable  almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear  i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats  sandals  heels  wedges would all look good.,1,Dresses

What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me  tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so  i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.,1,Blouses

I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however  when i tried it on  i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck  arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy  although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me  but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so  it may be best to wear a cami,1,Dresses

This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it's not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it's lined with the softest faux fur)  it's quilted in an army green  and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here  for instance  with the beading or the material on the trim. however  they didn't cut those corners. instead  the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can't wait till the weather g,1,Jackets
Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and it's so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!,1,Dresses

This was about to be my first retailer splurge item  but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag  these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.,1,Pants
Tried on standard xs and the photo on-line is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern. in person  the pattern is not as intricate with only 2 solid colors. the body of the shirt is light  airy/billowy  not as form grazing like on the model..which i don't mind. i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around. note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik,1,Blouses

Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said  the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes  i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly  but a 6 would have looked lumpy,1,Dresses

This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 12 top  or a l  but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits  and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that  it looks great  just runs small. if you are a size 14 or larger  i don't think that this will fit.,1,Knits
This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture  color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!,1,Outerwear

This is a great tee.... i bought this in the green in a size m. i'm normally a small but because of the fitted look  i opted for the medium. i probably could have sized down to the small  but the medium is still fitted just not too tight  which is actually a nice look. the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves. the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me  but it's so cute that i'm keeping it.,1,Knits
This is a well made sweater. i sometimes have a problem with wool but this is as soft as cashmere and does not itch at all. the color is beautiful and will work with gray black tan and navy. i found this to run a little bit on the large side. i am between a size large and extra large and ordered the extra large. there is too much fabric on the sides and the peplum starts at an awkward spot  mid hip instead of waistline. i think that sizing down to a large will solve these problems. it is really,1,Sweaters
Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it  and know it will work well for both the office  church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes  and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great  even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall  i'm satisfied with my purchase!,1,Dresses
This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit  length  and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter  but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :),1,Fine gauge
Picked this up in the white  and it's adorable. i'm a 2 in maeve blouses  usually just to fit my bust. i picked it up in the 2 because that's all my store had  and it fits. it's definitely tight across the bust  but not constricting. the shirt has no give  but it's still comfy  and to be expected from 100% cotton. the peplum is very dramatic high-low  and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh that's what makes it so gorgeous! great blouse  so precious.,1,Blouses
Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.,1,Jackets
Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well. length is perfect for me. i'm almost 5ft 6 in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats  heels  or boots work great with these pants. i bought size 29 and i'm 135 lbs. colors in pants are beautiful. many different colored tops go well with them,1,Jeans
Heavy in weight but not uncomfortable to wear because it's fully lined and has an easy fit that skims without looking like a potato sack! fits a little large but mainly tts. if you're between sizes  then i would size down  unless you're very blessed from the waist down. i am a m/l on top and s/m on bottom and bought the medium. it's a relaxed dress (like a shift suppose to be) that i can wear a turtleneck under without feeling stuffed.,1,Dresses

I have many left of center tees  and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color)  which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long  the cotton is thick  and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me  though  because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me  though.,1,Knits

"This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy  feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs  it's long on me at 5'4"" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h",1,Knits
This dress is nice  but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress  but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty  but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.,1,Trend
Very cute summer dress. it runs a bit large and it doesn't give you shape. but  it's good for me to hide my belly fat. the dress is so comfortable to wear. i didn't know that it has pockets  so that was a pleasant surprise (i always love pockets). overall  it's a perfect summer dress.,1,Dresses
I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them  they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them!

Cute dress that is perfect for a casual summer wedding or brunch with friends. i love the material and that the dress is lined. it is very comfortable and it has pockets. this is definitely more of a ?golden? yellow vs. a soft yellow. my only complaint is that i wish it were cinched more right below the bust. it would give the dress (and me) more shape. i would say this dress is true to size but if you have a larger chest  you will likely want to size up. if you have a small chest  i would proba,1,Dresses

This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering  yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper didn't work well. it just wouldn't zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?  the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it  so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.,1,Dresses
I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it  but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1  around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut,1,Dresses

I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium  but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue  because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but  if that doesn't solve the trick  if not recommend  b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.,1,Knits

I tried this dress on in my local retailer and was pleasantly surprised. it fit!!!...and looked cute. as other reviewers have mentioned  it runs small  but it is super stretchy  especially in the top portion. with that said  it accommodated my bust! i have a 32g bust  and it possess a problem for me when i try to buy dresses. the top of this dress is pure elastic  so it works. the dress stretches on top  but comes back inward on the body?so i can show off my curves. i have no idea what bra i can w,1,Dresses

This top is so pretty and the fabric is really soft...but  it does fit a little bit small in the bust. i am not extremely large busted but the buttons gap open just a little and it's tight across my back. otherwise  i love this top and the colors are really  really nice.,1,Blouses

I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans  black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket  and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change,1,Blouses

I was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store. i'm normally a size 2 but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms  so found a size 4 to be just right. it's longer and a bit wider than the size 2 everywhere else  but given the design  i thought it was fine. the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever. if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders  sizing up is a must. lengthwise  it fit me like it does on the model.

Everything about the dress is worth it. it's true the buttons are loosely sewn on  but that's easily fixed. i'm a slim person but broad in the shoulders  so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow  fitted construction. large-chested ladies or athletic types should size up.,1,Dresses

I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time  layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring  especially with that flower print.,1,Dresses

I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and i'm so happy i did!  this is a very well-made  well-designed dress that is quite figure flattering.  the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together.  the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings.  this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy.  i can't wait for an occasion to wear this dress!,1,Dresses
I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area  even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side,1,Blouses

This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops  and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though  which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp  it actually looks bigger. regardless  i love it and was o,1,Jackets

I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.,1,Dresses

I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years  and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size  rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial  stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all  and it also a nice smooth fit  skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate,1,Skirts

Cute skirt and print  but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture  but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.,1,Skirts

"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5"".",1,Dresses

I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white  yellow  pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.,1,Pants

This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything  so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly  without being too heavy.,1,Jackets
So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied  but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes!   fits tts.,1,Knits

I love the long tunic with high slits  it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag  must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it  just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!,1,Knits
Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small   and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.,1,Layering
Beautiful and chic. so glad i tried it on!,1,Knits
I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture  but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer  so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.,1,Dresses

This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.,1,Knits

This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.,1,Knits

I absolutely love these capris. after reading the reviews  i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh  but they fit perfectly. i am roughly a size six (depending on the design  i can sometimes squeeze into a 4). i bought the size 27 in these and its perfect. also  i thought that the green would be more of a mint  but its definitely a more of a mossy color. i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything! will be getting more colors in the future! great buy!,1,Pants

I am not going to keep this dress  just because i am a little too old and need a little more structure for my figure. but it is a very cute  comfy throw-on dress. you could wear tennis  bootles  etc.   especially great for a pretty slender person ..then the loose flowy style is still attractive,1,Lounge

Got the small petite. length is perfect  love the color  super comfy  very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top  so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits  if not it's going back. i'm 5' ,1,Dresses

This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester  and it is  but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large  so go a size smaller than you would normally  and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester  why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth,1,Dresses

As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.,1,Dresses
These coveralls are not cut long enough  i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice  my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep,1,Jeans

I absolutely love slips  and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans  i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses  and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough,1,Sleep
I just love this top  it has a flattering cut  fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!,1,Blouses

I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable  warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing  i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.,1,Lounge

The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.  i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit  so if you prefer something more form fitting  you might opt for a smaller size.,1,Sweaters
I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller  and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy  it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work  dinner  or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.,1,Knits
I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short  i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.  fits true to size  soft fabric  very cute.,1,Skirts

This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok  will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.,1,Dresses

I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake  i don't anticipate this will last that long  but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t,1,Knits
I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down  both jeans and leggings work well,1,Blouses
I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6)  and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc,1,Skirts
As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.,1,Fine gauge

Received this yesterday  wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable  yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting  but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots.,1,Trend

I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!,1,Knits

The blouse is gorgeous. the detail to the blouse is outstanding and it is very feminine. from the pictures  front and back  there appears to be flow to it and room. however  my general size m was absolutely gigantic. it was like a tent. i was speechless when i looked in the mirror. i debated tapering it and then thought that's just too much effort. i'm going to return and see if i can order in 2 sizes smaller. i'm 5'1 and a 36c  if this helps.,1,Knits
I bought this dress on a whim one day  even though i wasn't sure where i would wear it  but i just had to have it. this dress fits beautifully  and is very flattering. i am 5'9 and typically a size 14 with large hips  behind  and a smaller waist. the 12 fit me very well--snugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else. i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments. go for it!,1,Dresses

This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen  stripes  pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p,1,Outerwear
Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on  especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully  and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin  soft  light-weight knit  but i think that makes it practical for year-round use  much like other items by bordeaux.,1,Knits

Well made  versatile dress. have already worn it to a wedding and work - could definitely be dressed down for a more casual look. i'm 5 7 and typically wear a medium in dresses and the small was definitely the right fit with some room to spare.,1,Dresses
But i thought this was lace or with texture  it is more a pattern on regular fabric.    colors are nice  there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern  the fit is nice  the 0p fit snugly enough  i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-),1,Skirts
These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did  so i'm stoked.,1,Jeans

This arrived just in time for the winter snow storm.  i was glad i had read previous reviews advising that it ran large  and that the gray sleeves are surprisingly attached to the sweater  and do not represent a separate top beneath the sweater.  i got a size small  and it fits perfectly. it's big and boxy but doesn't make feel like i look fat. with slim-fitting trousers - it's super stylish.,1,Jackets

For the sale price  this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because  being on sale  that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders  and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later  i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers  but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true,1,Blouses

I wear these pants 3-4 days a week. i work in advertising  so they go perfectly with the polished/ trendy/ casual office attire that is required! they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own-- and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight. they are a unique type of material  a soft but structured stretch weave-- so more polished than normal jeggings-- and smooth over bumps  while still highlighting subtle curves. the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish  but also provide a more,1,Jeans

I'm curvy  and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome  especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips  so if you're trying to hide hips  these aren't for you. i love them  though--they drape beautifully and feel great.,1,Pants

I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale  i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of  i really do recommend it- well made  lovely colors  and nice style.,1,Dresses

I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me  more orange than a true coral. but for summer  is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference  i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small  my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral  i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little  but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee  with yoga pants ,1,Lounge

This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling  which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone),1,Dresses

Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen  cotton  and acrylic  so it's not heavy  it's weighty. anyways  it seemed to run large just due to gravity  so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.,1,Sweaters

I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color  and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically  long sleeved shirts are too short for me  so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.,1,Knits

This is a very loose fitting style jacket. if you like your jackets oversized  get your regular size. if you prefer the slightly loose (but not baggy) fit like the product photo  size down. as noted by another reviewer  the sleeves are incredibly long. i would say if you are a typical size 0 or 2 (unless you like the oversized fit)  you are likely sized out of this jacket. it's a shame  because the quality is great and the windowpane print is beautiful. i'm sadly sized out.,1,Jackets

I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately  but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.    i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.,1,Blouses

The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge

This is already sold out in petites and the reason for this is asymmetrical stripes: this is the most flattering design for tops. horizontal stripes only look good on people trying to look bigger and heavier. do you know anyone like that  b/c i don't! vertical stripes  while slimming  generally look a little severe  modern  weird (occasionally great)  while asymmetrical stripes knock 5lbs off a person. stock more asymmetrical striped tops  please!,1,Knits

The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.,1,Sweaters

Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego  i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on  but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible  i guess it's worth it!

I ordered a regular size 6 because the petite size 6 was sold out. it was too large for me; maybe the 4 would have worked. in part because the size was off  it looked frumpy on me with the poofs and flowers. however  i did like that it is cotton and has its own beige-colored slip that snaps on at the shoulders. i have no doubt this could look very nice on someone if the size was just right.. i like the black crochet-type details.,1,Dresses

Okay  these are seriously the cutest black jeans i've ever put on my body. i can't say enough positive things about them. sure  the color bleeds a little (like the previous review stated)  but they're black jeans. i haven't encountered a single pair of designer black jeans that don't have some color transfer.     also  these jeans are really stretchy which makes them a dream to wear.     here is my one complaint -- i am normally a size 29-30 depending upon brand  cut etc. i had to size down to a,1,Jeans
I love this top and despite the higher price point  it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white  black  gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey  but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per,1,Blouses
I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy.  i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering  in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming  it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.,1,Sleep

This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.  it is fitted  but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis  this dress is a winner!,1,Dresses

I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.,1,Knits
I had sized down because i'm usually a petite  but didn't have the option for petite here  and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit  but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric  but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely  quality dress  and the color is,1,Dresses

I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small  but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.,1,Lounge

This is so much better than wearing a grey sweatshirt. i love it and it makes me feel pretty.,1,Knits
This dress is gorgeous! pictures online do not do it justice! my only issue is that it is slightly sheer  even with the layers under the skirt. will probably require nude boy shorts. i would say it runs tts if not a little bit large. i ordered my normal size 6 and the band and bust are snug but not uncomfortable  but the back mesh portion is loose. it hits me about where it hits the model in length. i was able to find one that somebody returned in-store so that was helpful. for reference i am 5',1,Dresses
This is an awesome vest - so soft  cozy  and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did  i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.,1,Fine gauge
First  i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.,1,Dresses
Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin  lightweight  and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..,1,Blouses
This is a good skirt  although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well  has a good shape  and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok  and i'll keep it  but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work  but probably not to nicer events.,1,Skirts
Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch  the red is a beautiful rich red  and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans  and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too  but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too  unless i turn the band up t,1,Fine gauge

I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft  drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue  not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little  but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit  yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt  go down a size or look for something else.,1,Blouses
Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side  but i read that many others had the opposite problem  particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me  it looks and feels great.,1,Dresses
"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color  very feminine without being over the top.  i'm 5'4""  123lbs  34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there  making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place  although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly",1,Blouses
You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference  i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed  and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.,1,Dresses

"I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel ""sack-like"". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous.",1,Dresses
This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions don't look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.,1,Sweaters
"I'm between sizes in deletta (m to l  5'4""  34g).  i ended up purchasing the large in both black and sapphire.  it does fit a bit tight in the arms and torso  but it's a nice basic top for work  and does well with changing seasons.",1,Knits
I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6  i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace  the length  color and detail on this one. it's also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:),1,Dresses

First off  this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt  but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear  but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut  you could wear it oversized without it drowning you  or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia,1,Knits
I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s  but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front  so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway  but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store  and it fit perfectly  so this one is just running small. overall  i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.,1,Fine gauge
Beautiful sweater - cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation. the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone (exactly as shown on the model) and i really like that. sheer fabric but still a sweater - you will need a cami or tank underneath. can't wait to wear it!,1,Sweaters

I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style  it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist  just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d  135#  38-28-35.,1,Jackets

Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however  i'm keeping it because it's versatile  i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button  meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.,1,Jackets

This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made. i've taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable. at the same time  i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it. itt pairs well with so many types of pants. the only negative is that i only own one (the cream color). i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance! i really hope to see this top come back again later!,1,Knits
"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly  the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy  so i went into the store to try a 2  but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs)  so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though  the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing  it's perfect.",1,Dresses
This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top  felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .,1,Blouses

I really like this dress. buying it during retailer weekend helps me to like it more. the fabric is lovely. i like the popover styling. its slightly boxy  but not oversized. the sleeves do puff a little bit and i wish they didn't  but that's not a deal breaker. the shoulders are cut a little small  so it can be a challenge to take off. i usually wear a medium or an 8 in most retailer brands. i ordered this in a medium and it fit true to size.,1,Dresses
I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless  the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person  shorter tops look best.,1,Knits
I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn't show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater!,1,Sweaters

I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise  as both colors are really nice in person. the black  of course  is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small  but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad  but a little bigger than expected.  teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though  so may show things (thinking bra ripples  and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it,1,Knits

I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was  however  pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side  noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much,1,Blouses

I love finding cute tops on sale that have great potential  but just need a little altering. i bought this one in my usual size medium and took it in 2 inches on both sides. it's still a looser fit  but much cuter. i didn't want to size down fearing it would be too tight in the shoulders and underarms. it's also a softer cotton fabric (similar to brushed cotton) rather than the crisp cotton most white button down shirts are made of.,1,Blouses

I always love the arielle jeans. every color seems to be slightly different in the fit  but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting. to echo the other reviews  the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own. i have a fairly straight  athletic shaped body and went with my 'larger' size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit. the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr,1,Jeans

This jacket is absolutely beautiful. the color is a much deeper navy than it appears in the pictures  and the brocade with the contrasting lining is lovely. however  as another reviewer commented  the back across the shoulders is incredibly small. i ordered up from my normal 2 to a 4  and it was still too tight. there is no way i could even lift my arms over my head without ripping out the back of the jacket. i fear a 6 will be too big. this one is going back  sadly.,1,Jackets
I echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.    i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering.,1,Knits
I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type  which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame  but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.,1,Dresses
I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket  but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room  order a size up. the quality is nice  i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me  just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.,1,Outerwear

I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders  larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.,1,Dresses

I do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it. very soft  good length  and comfortable to wear. the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering. the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production. for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top. it is not a sheer fabric. try it on if you see it in the store.,1,Knits

Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet  it's almost weightless  which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!,1,Knits

I was hoping this top would be a nice architectural piece to add to my wardrobe with its straight black line accents. sadly  in the end  it is just a t-shirt. a large t-shirt. i ordered my normal size (medium) and this shirt ran more like a large. i also did not like the way the neck was hemmed. the fabric folds over itself  when i think a better design would have been a more simple hem. i ended up returning this item due to its size.,1,Knits

Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous  it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric  but that's what i was expecting  and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.,1,Lounge
I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me. the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in  so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6  but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow  but not overly so  so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything  for many seasons. love the quality.,1,Blouses

This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage  too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.  i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said  i went with a,1,Swim

Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,1,Intimates

Living in alaska means fall starts early and winter runs long. this great little skirt is perfect for casual fridays and weekends. i am 4'11 and ordered the petite 4  which is a little big around the waist  but could tuck a sweater or shirt in. absolutely love this skirt and thinking about purchasing in another color.,1,Skirts
I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it's loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans  booties  simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.,1,Blouses
This dress is black and white as pictured (as opposed to actually being cream)  and it fits true to size. i've found that this particular brand runs tight in the shoulders for me  but that isn't the case here. the cut is very flattering  and it's great that this has functional pockets.  i was excited that the skirt is fully lined  but the top is ridiculously sheer. even with a nude bra  this dress needs a camisole underneath it. it's so flattering  but i'm not sure if i'll keep it.,1,Dresses
A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark   faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality  textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.,1,Knits
I saw this online first and didn't care for it. then i saw it in-store and purchased it with little memory of the online experience  because the dress is that much better in person: it's (nearly) seasonless  looks great with fall boots  and has garnered many compliments. this is one of those that the internet can't really do justice to. i withhold a star for quality since the snap-in keeps for the slip were confusing (and maybe it's just the one i bought): one of the keeps was detached from the,1,Dresses

Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top! i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it. i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size 6 which normally is perfect in maeve tops. this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange. if your on the fence  go for it!,1,Blouses

Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse  but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture  and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion  but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun  cute detail  and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.,1,Blouses

I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all  the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy  it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.,1,Jackets

"The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however  the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.  however  the fabric is beautiful  the fit was perfect (size 2  5'4""  106 lbs.)  the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to ""sew away"" the ""wings"" on both si",1,Blouses

I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant  sophisticated  and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy  form fitting  sexy sheer upper and front back panel  you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress  the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.,1,Dresses

Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,1,Dresses

It was a little on the thinner side (fabric)  a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back  i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable  and the back is beautiful (love bows)  tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price  even on sale  i didn't feel i absolutely needed it  but if you are looking for a hite tank  it is pretty cute.

I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so  if you want a more tailored  but loose fit  then size down.     but  it isn't boxy. and  the deep v is sexy  but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk  but it's just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability  like when you drive. there isn't much pull.     it's a thin light material and very cool for hot  humid summer,1,Knits

I had been looking for a jacket like this for months  but haven't found the right style  until i saw this one! luckily it was on sale. i am 5'10  weigh ca. 143lb's and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops. tried on medium  but it was too big in the bust area.  then i tried on the small and it fits great! the sleeves are long enough too  but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something  so i just have to avoid that. :) i have gotten a lot of compliments for it.,1,Outerwear
I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it  it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled  but i'm used to ironing things  so that didn't bother me. unfortunately  i had to return it though because of the color. i'm filipino  and this yellow just isn't flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with  but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring,1,Dresses
They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection  due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality  the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.,1,Lounge

This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s  which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long  even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me  but on it is very flattering.,1,Sweaters
I had to have this jacket! looks much better in person. i bought the navy color. the fit is great. it has a flowy bottom and is unstructured. i wear a dark navy t shirt or cami underneath. great with jeans and over the knee boots or booties. its a bit heavy and bulky to wear under a coat.,1,Sweaters
"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color  but i agree with the other reviewer here  the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!).",1,Skirts

I'm petite  short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates).     unfortunately  the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise  however  it would have been too long for my torso  which i run into a lot.     too bad.,1,Dresses

Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office  and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer  or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body  as the top is wide on the bottom. hence  gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing  or may be a good thing. still  overall  a keeper.,1,Blouses

I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip  however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.,1,Dresses
This top is very nice  very pretty. i thought the design on the top is more shiny but it is embroidery-like threads. it looks quite nice but is very very short  like a crop top. it came just down to the top of my tummy. i wish it were longer  i would have kept it. but it is a nice top  flattering for curvy figures.,1,Blouses

I just got this shirt the other day  and already love it. it fits like a basic tee  but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom  which makes this really comfortable.  my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back  but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too  so the quality feels nice.,1,Knits

I got one of these tanks  and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray  green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me  but that's no problem. the shirts are darling  they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way  but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow  and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones  i don't love bright colors but i love the green  white,1,Lounge

These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string  which ended up working out  but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites  but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts  as th,1,Shorts

I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo  so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person  the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate,1,Blouses

I tried on the white top at the store. the quality was very good and i loved the overall concept of the design. the dark stripes on the back are slightly raised  giving it a nice texture. the fabric was soft and comfortable. however  the shape just didn't drape as well on me as i had hoped  so ultimately i didn't buy it. perhaps a petite length would have fit me better.,1,Fine gauge

Great fit in waist  hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.  i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.,1,Jeans

Really beautiful dress  too special for me as a guest at a wedding. i think this can be used as a wedding dress in an informal intimate wedding. it is shift dress  so not accentuate your body which is to be expected. it is running small. with my athletic body especially up top  the chest/arms are tight. i could have gone a size up but the body might be too big. i unto lately returned.,1,Dresses

I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric  but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland  but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream  plus it looks amazing from the back.,1,Knits

This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat  but this wasn't an issue at all  probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.,1,Intimates
Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months  and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length  i feel a great length when you're only 5'1  will look great wi,1,Dresses

The colors and textures on this top are fun. however  the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.,1,Knits
This top is so pretty. the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse. it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come. i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really don't care because it is so comfortable and pretty. i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer.,1,Blouses

This t-shirt is very casual  so it is perfect for everyday use.   touch of textile is comfortable  so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt.   although stripe is a simple design  it does not limit your choise of fashion  so it can go with almost anything.   just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.,1,Knits
Perfect! very pretty and flattering without being too fussy. helps to hide my tummy and very well made. that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably. usually a 4 or a 6 and i needed a 10 to be comfortable. the 8 went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up. i am never a 10 but that's what worked in this blouse. surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored. definately runs on the smaller side.    lovely. worth the full price in my opinion.,1,Blouses

Another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill. usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size. i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me. very happy with the color  quality and uniqueness of the dress!,1,Dresses

I love peasant shirts so wanted to try it. cute top  but v-neck was lower than i was expecting. i have to wear an undershirt under this for that and also because of sheerness. fyi- shirt is off-white so stark white cami didn't work. was struggling to find something  but have the leana v-neck in navy- worked perfect and follows neckline exactly. now really cute! need something not long sleeves to wear under for spring weather here  but will keep and try to figure it out. 5'4  135 lbs  ordered xs.,1,Knits
Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late  this brand has really fallen all over the board for me  but this top had the right fabric  fit  and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!,1,Blouses
I ordered this in a size s  my usual size and it fits great. i love the color  style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of  ever so slightly  poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color  i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!,1,Dresses
I purchased in the raspberry  love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool  and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.,1,Fine gauge
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on  with the lines running down vertical  giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on  and has nice  large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on  and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference  i'm 5'7"" tall  and weigh close to 130 lbs.  and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice  but i",1,Pants

Love the fabric and design of this dress  very unique and comfortable. it is not lined  which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'' 127lbs  athletic build and the 4 fit,1,Dresses

This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas)  so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color  but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.,1,Dresses

I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it  but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well  but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist  but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas,1,Shorts
Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all  but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium  sometimes a small  but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!,1,Blouses
As the previous reviewer mentioned  this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft  high quality material  and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c,1,Dresses

This dress is gorgeous yet sturdy  it is all about the lace. size regular 4 fit my chest area well and i like the midi look (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips). whether regular or petite size  when i walked or turned  the pleats added too much volume and looked overwhelming and no shape. i tried it with a belt and it looked better  but looked odd because the pleats poofed at the belt area. i tried with a sweater  jacket...then finally gave up. it would look gorgeous on a tall thin gal.,1,Dresses

I've been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect. one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress (it looks even better in person!). the material is a thicker  almost canvas-y type of fabric  which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me. i love how comfortable the dress is and it's so easy to throw it on and look amazing. i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti,1,Dresses

This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket  but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.,1,Jackets

This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!)  and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full  but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.,1,Dresses
This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!,1,Knits
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.,1,Jackets
This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.,1,Dresses
"I really wish this had fit me so i could keep the vest. beautiful colors and construction. i am 5'9"" with a 36c chest. the medium was quite a bit too small across the chest (i could not close the hook) but it fit perfectly around the hips. i did not want to order a large because i felt the boxy style would be too large around the hips even if the chest fit better.",1,Outerwear
I really love this dress  just not on me! i am very curvy  with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8  160lbs)  and the 10 fit  but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach  i would have kept it  but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great  the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend  who is picky ,1,Dresses
This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.,1,Dresses
This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights  etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you  buy it!,1,Dresses
Love this dress but wish the lining was full length - will be removing this liner and using a different slip underneath!,1,Dresses
I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately  they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer.,1,Fine gauge

I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline  so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale  but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather  though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n,1,Dresses

Cute  easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt  or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though  it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length  long enough for work.,1,Dresses
"I'm 5'5"" and got the m. i thought i'd need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on!",1,Dresses
"The skirt material is super comfortable. hte cut is also pretty flattering  i don't hink this picture does the skirt justice. the regualr size was a little long on me  i would order a petite (if like me  you are 5'1.5""#  went xs #at 115 lbs). the skirt is also a bit stretchy  not stiff.    color is way prettier in person  i never looked twice at th skirt online  but in the store  it looked myuch prettier.",1,Skirts

Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (5 ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!,1,Jeans
This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems  but loved it so much  i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.,1,Lounge
"Wow  i wish this would have worked for me. the pom details are truly adorable and give the sweater that extra added touch. i agree with the other reviewer that the ""crop"" style is almost too much and gives an awkward fit. i am short  5'2"" so it cut me off in the wrong area (i bought a petite xs). the material is delicate but that is part of the charm so i didn't have a problem with that at al. my problem was the fit-- a bit too boxy for my build. wish it would have worked but i'll have to admire",1,Sweaters

I love this top  but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath.  as the pic shows  the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place... kinda odd placement in my opinion. but if you don't mind the sheerness or a cami  it's a great top.,1,Knits

"These trousers arrived today. yippee. i really wanted to love them. i do like the color and the cut. not crazy about the fold-over waist. the fit through the waist  hips  and thighs is true to size. the biggest issue is that the description states that the inseam is 31.5"" which is perfect for me. however  these pants are actually 33.5"" in the inseam which makes heels a necessity if i want to wear them without altering them. i rarely wear heels these days  so that does not make me happy. one leg",1,Pants

I just bought this skirt in the store and i'm happy with it  it can be dressed up or down it is made of washable silk so it doesn't require dry cleaning (but it should be hand washed or on delicate cycle obviously). it fits through the hips without being overly clingy. the waist is a wide stretchy smocking style so there is some give.,1,Skirts

I saw this in store  but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however  i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans  but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.,1,Jackets
This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression  wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done  pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long  so i will have to hem.,1,Dresses

I am petite with somewhat broad shoulders. iusually wear 2 or 2p dresses. i ordered a 2 and it was tight in the shoulders & hip. otherwise this is a cute dress  looks better on the person than in pictures. the tie is an interesting twist on an otherwse basic shirtdress. the fabric drapes nicely on the body  i reordered dress in a 4. inever wear size4. hopefully it's not too big or long.,1,Dresses
I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on  i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts.,1,Fine gauge

I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs. when i tried the blue one  xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath. however  when i tried the beige one  xs fits me well with some room for sweater. either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.,1,Lounge
The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring   summer and early fall. super comfy  casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.,1,Skirts

The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.,1,Fine gauge

This sweater is pretty  fits tts  feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures  i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think,1,Sweaters
Wow  i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank  i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy.   would totally buy different colors if it came in others  but i'm no,1,Blouses

I bought this dress online in the cream/black combo for an incredible deal. i wasn't thrilled about it when it arrived  even for the ridiculously low price  because the contrast between the top and bottom was too big. the two materials are quite different: the top fabric being much more casual than the bottom fabric  and with the color contrast it just looked like a top and skirt that you wouldn't put together if they were separates. when i went to my local store to return  they had the grey com,1,Dresses

A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places  no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size  you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.,1,Blouses

The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist  but corrected by pairing with an obi belt  which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides  but,1,Dresses

Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up  i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight  but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft  yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors  this is out of the box,1,Skirts

This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit  but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up.,1,Swim

I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length  too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.    rolls are not sewn on both ends  so you'll have to re-roll each wash.    wish you carried these basics at all times.,1,Pants
This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.  i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.  overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale  i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome.,1,Pants

I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.,1,Blouses

This dress is comfortable and versatile - one could wear it to the office or to a social event  day to night. i didn't find the sizing to run as large as some of the other reviewers did. i felt it was true to size. it is not lined so you would need a slip under it if you wear it with tights or nylons  otherwise the skirt will cling.,1,Dresses
"Bought this in navy. needed something comfortable  but able to dress up denim. this was perfect! wore it already and immediately got 2 complements. the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large. bought in medium. i'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs. just washed it for first time. noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front. may have to steam to get wrinkles out  but still worth it.",1,Knits
"Soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm. flattering cut. quality material and construction. fully opaque  so no show-though. true to size (i'm 5'8""  140 lbs  my usual size small is perfect). could not improve upon these joggers. love  love  love.",1,Lounge

This si=hirt actually has a shimmer to the fabric. it is more of sweatshirt material but i like the thickness  not too thick not too thin. the color is nice in person  and has a shimmer to it. i like the detail in the neck too with the sequins. reason i didn't get it is it felt a little big on me (smallest is xs) and also the color wasn't optimal (i am rather pale). otherwise  i do like the shirt.,1,Knits

"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts  and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal  unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not.",1,Jackets
I do not think this dress runs large. i think it it is true to size. i am usually a size 10 and a 34dd. definitely curvy and tall at 5'8. the large was perfect for my bust. i ordered a med also  and it looks really narrow in the waist. length is below knees as pictured. i was finding that the zipper under left arm is very catchy. i even checked the med and it is worse. that concerns me  but love the dress so i am keeping the large. length is so hard. i hardly ever find a dress the hits a little,1,Dresses

The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,1,Dresses
I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,1,Blouses
Fun and elegant!  this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials  as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.  it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece  which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear,1,Outerwear
I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others  but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look  because it's pretty drapey. really versatile  lovely tunic.,1,Blouses

"If you are shaped anything like me  you will have to size up quite a bit on this one. i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up 2 or more sizes to get the proper fit. the fabric has no ""give"" and feels a little cheap in my opinion. for your reference  i am a curvy  athletic build with broad shoulders.",1,Dresses
Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it  perfect holiday party dress!,1,Dresses
This dress is super sweet  but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size  unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.,1,Dresses

I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat  and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance  yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome  just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.,1,Dresses
These are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot. however  my normal 25 was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house  they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every 2 seconds. i ordered the black  mostly because i wasn't crazy about any of the other colors. if there were any colors left in a 24 that i could see myself wearing  i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me. i think if they fit you well a,1,Pants

"This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the ""see-through"" issue that the other reviewer mentioned  my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.",1,Skirts
This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!,1,Dresses

This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning  i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!,1,Knits

I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.,1,Knits

I absolutely love this top  especially for fl weather. it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look. i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim! i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this! love it!,1,Knits

When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference  it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so  i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo,1,Dresses

Beautifully made  designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe  which is quite long  overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me  i do recommend.,1,Fine gauge
I'm glad the previous reviews had mentioned the dolman sleeves so i was better prepared for how it would fit. you do have to do some rearranging of the fabric  but it generally stays put and isn't bothersome. the neckline is a bit more structured than shown in the pictures  but it only adds to a more sophisticated look. great fabric and color as well.,1,Knits
I'm fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me- it's actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though- good quality material too!,1,Knits
This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats  etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.,1,Fine gauge

I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!,1,Knits

Runs big  especially if you're on the shorter side - very long on my 5'3: frame  even in extra small. material was thinner than i'd hoped  doesn't look as smooth as on the model. this top will really only look good with leggings - pants with any detail or rear pockets will show through and detract from the look. i do like the sleeve length and rich colors for fall.,1,Knits

This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit  and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!,1,Knits

The lace on this looks like it would be stiff  but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.    it's as see through as the photo. and  i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra,1,Knits

Love this dress and so sorry it's not available in xxs. tried on today in store and the xs was very large in the upper body. i normally wear a 2-4  so this was surprising. if you happen to need probably size 6 or larger  you're in luck!,1,Dresses

Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting  so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight  the length is a not-too-short above knee  the tiered layers swing so nicely  and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o,1,Dresses

"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat  skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#.",1,Dresses
I thought the design of this dress was distinctive  and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on  but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive  there is something special about the dress.,1,Dresses

Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online  but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!,1,Knits

I was excited to get these pants & at a great price! i am 5'9 & these pants were plenty long enough for me. they also have a nice light textured design that's hard to notice in pictures. the only problem was they are a side zip pant which i didn't know when ordering. i don't love the zip on the side for my shape it. so i'm still wondering if i'll keep them. other than that nice pant!,1,Pants
I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft  but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.,1,Jackets

This top is gorgeous! it's a nice weight and the cami that comes with it makes it drapes nicely. i'll have to send it back though because it's too big. i'm always a medium but in this i'll be a small. :(,1,Blouses
Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.,1,Outerwear
Short of calling it dark gray- which  isn't dark  but that's fine because i saw the picture. it's everything i wanted it to be. i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often,1,Fine gauge

I saw this top online and fell in love with it  as i live in white cotton comfy tanks  but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d  and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this,1,Lounge
"This dress is just as it appears. it is very well made  lined and falls in heavier but fluid waves. the bodice fit snug and the zipper worked almost perfectly (!). the color is very pink  like pepto bismal but not in a bad way  if that's possible. my husband loved the dress on me but my 22 year old daughter thought it was too pink  too girly... i think i decided it was just too young for me- i'm 53. . alas  i am returning it but i still think fondly of this piece. i am 5'4""  110 lbs and i bought",1,Dresses
I really love this coat! i usually wear a size 8 but ordered up a size because i just wanted that look. it is a very warm coat  wasn't expecting that! it is very soft and i love it! one problem  it sheds like crazy  bummer. i wore it over a black turtle neck sweater and when i took my coat off it looked like i had a white cat living in my house. my sweater was covered. i'm hoping it will shed less as i wear it longer. having said that   i still love the look and warmth. i will just need to plan,1,Outerwear
The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans  and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky  but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in  or out and about for casual outings.,1,Sweaters
I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.,1,Sweaters
I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.,1,Swim

I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.,1,Swim
Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.,1,Skirts

I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch  see  try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.    i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee,1,Dresses

I really wanted to not like the top for that price  but ti looks really good  the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p  not sure what size to get  and it is just fine. the length is almost too short  but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide  like poofing out a bit  perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer  but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also  teh colla,1,Blouses
130 lb  5'5  32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style  but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said  the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging  without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses  but the lining on this dres,1,Dresses

This dress is beautiful and timeless. i wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments. i love how i can also wear it to so many other engagements. i plan to wear it for mother's day brunch  a friend's wedding shower  and know that the clasic cut will be a staple in my closet for years to come. the quality is what you expect for the price and is well worth your investment.,1,Dresses

"This dress has a beautiful fit--5'4""  150 lbs  34ddd  and the medium regular fit great. the only issue is that the bottom part of the dress wrinkles terribly. when i bought it  the woman folded it nicely  and i stashed it in my car for the rest of my shopping trip. when i arrived home and pulled it out  the bottom of the dress was horribly wrinkled. plus it's dry clean only. going back. :(",1,Dresses

I originally ordered this in green  and unlike another reviewer  i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy  flattering and fun in green  but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term  so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut  and if that is what you want  it runs true to size. however  if  like me  you want something a little more form fitting  consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size ) and just carefully shimmy,1,Dresses

I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.,1,Dresses
This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.,1,Swim

This maeve dress caught my eye for its unique styling  and did not disappoint in person. v-neckline is deep  but not revealing. there is a nice hemstitch detail on the sleeve trim. the pattern is a good scale for a strong frame.  what surprised me: 1.) the dress is actually black with light brown flowers. on my screen  it looked brown with bronze flowers. 2.) there are pockets in this unlined dress! they are placed on-seam  but feel weirdly awkward to access  almost as if they are set back. they,1,Dresses

"Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference.",1,Jeans

Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.,1,Sweaters

In true cloth & stone fashion  this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small  but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash)  and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down  depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.,1,Dresses
I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable  stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.,1,Knits

Love the crochet detail on the back. yes  it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.,1,Blouses

Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered  voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting.   i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble.,1,Dresses

I am on the fence with this one.......the black lace on the bottom is beautiful and pairs so well with my black velvet gladiator sandals..... but it came very wrinkled  and the fabric almost feels more like a cheap cotton. i am always in between a sm and med  so tried the small. the shoulders do want to slide up a bit. arms need to be down.  it is very voluminous......and falls below my bottom. would make a pretty maternity top!! the idea of it overall is pretty  but not sure i want all the volu,1,Blouses

These pants fit great  true to size  heavy enough to withstand winter  and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw.,1,Pants

Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer  and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.,1,Skirts
This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.    i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package  there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that  but i usually don't find belts in my size.    as for the fit  it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!,1,Dresses

I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown,1,Jeans

This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shape it is true to size  i am 5'3 and 125b the 2 petite fit perfectly. the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette. it's the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy. this dress is so figure flattering  i could not believe how many complements i've received on it.,1,Dresses

I love the soft  slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order  the green version had sold out. as it turns out  the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today  but i wore it anyway!,1,Jackets

I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person  however  this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore)  and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall  too. great,1,Jackets

I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.,1,Dresses

I love this item! . they hang & flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt.  the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!  somewhat transparent i topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty... but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to.

I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top  dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!,1,Sweaters

"I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it  which can be true for a lot of ""swing"" dresses as some give off that ""baby bump"" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short  even for us at just over 5 feet tall.     when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels  it falls perfectly and",1,Dresses

I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on  but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first  they are definitely short when rolled twice  and i do not have skinny legs. in fact  i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason  these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer  but i still like them at home,1,Shorts
The color is a very dark mustard yellow  thin/light-weight material  and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m  i recommend the size up for hip fit.,1,Blouses
It's just as cute in person as it was in the picture. the material is very  very soft and 'sweater like'. i ordered my usual size and it fit fine  but i usually wear my dresses a bit looser. i liked it well enough to return it for a larger size.,1,Dresses
I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining  it adds a substantial look to the dress.,1,Dresses
This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.,1,Knits
After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls  but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.,1,Swim

I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12  but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee  so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.,1,Dresses

The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however  the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back  but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped  but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model  but not on me.,1,Dresses

I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress,1,Dresses

I wanted to love this blouse  but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty  so the placement of the peplum just didn't work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size  but the peplum just didn't work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.,1,Knits
Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it.     keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the,1,Dresses

As far as t-shirts go  this one is fun  i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs  30dd)  the shirt flares out (swing)  so it can be a little much on the smaller gals  but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty  but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer  must be the trend...,1,Knits
"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose  flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",1,Dresses

This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette  so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand  and,1,Jackets

I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish  but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online  and the fabric is so soft  it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely  and so it's flattering. overall  a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.,1,Dresses
"Loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large. i am usually a size 6 or m and the legs were a little baggy w/the medium. since the m is sold out i'm going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer. the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus. i'm 5'7"" and they are the perfect length.",1,Lounge

I love these t.la tees  and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt.,1,Knits

I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple. i like classic things with a twist  and this fits the bill. it is nice quality  and the colors are vivid. it is slightly tight in the bust line for me  but it is not retailer's fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress. i'll deal with it. otherwise  the dress is nice quality  and will come in handy throughout summer. the price is right  so grab it!!,1,Dresses

Stumbled upon these in a size medium at the store and was initially very disappointed that they were too big. the sales associate found an x-small and suggested that i try them on. i was so pleased that they fit (but am definitely not an x-small at this point in my bottom ... i mean  life).     wore these for a 4th of july party and felt elegant and comfortable all at once. they were just dressy enough with a white trapeze tank  long gold necklace  and gold sandals (i can only imagine them with,1,Pants
This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh,1,Knits
I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings  plus fleece. instead  they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm  though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them  but not what i was hoping for  either.,1,Legwear
This jacket is really pretty and unique. unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture. i'm 5 ft 6 in and a size 6. i ordered the medium. it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide. disappointed to have to return this.,1,Sweaters

This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love!   it is a little on the sheer side  though  and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage  but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.,1,Shorts

I love tracy reese designs because they are so feminine and figure flattering. this dress almost hits the target  it's just a bit off on the bodice  especially at the back and sides. the pleating balloons out too much. i'm sure a little tailoring will fix this  it's up to the buyer if that's worth the money to do it. for myself  i'm just wearing a thin cropped cardi to hide the billow. since petite was sold out  i took a regular size 8 which is the smaller of my size range. the length makes this,1,Dresses

I bought this dress for my college graduation  and it's truly gorgeous! i love the loose  breezy fit  but it did feel just a little bit sack-like on me  definitely more-so than i expected from looking at the product picture  even after sizing down to a small (which was comfortable  and i'm usually a medium). i ended up pairing it with a small belt.     really pretty dress  just be advised - leaves a *lot* of room around the waist!,1,Dresses

This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink  which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers  which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic  but it's snug.,1,Dresses

This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,1,Lounge

This top caught my eye right away and i had to have it! i am obsessed with everything off the shoulder and this is a great transition piece to wear that off the shoulder look well into fall. i was expecting the fabric to be a little lighter and i did't realize there would be a ribbed texture to the fabric. the shirt is also very long and i feel as though it runs large. that being said it looks super cute on and i intend to style it just as shown in these pictures with zipper accented skinny jean,1,Knits

Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.,1,Dresses

I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing  but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.,1,Dresses
It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.,1,Blouses
Almost the perfect skirt! great colors super cute fit very flattering great length very versatile. only issue was size; normally a solid 10  i ended up a full 2 sizes smaller. very stretchy and comfortable just try it on first or order a couple of sizes. go down at least 1 size. as others have said...pilcro strikes again its such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics.,1,Skirts

I walked into retailer today to buy 2 dishes for a registry. $$$ later i walked out with this dress (and another  ugh). it is so beautiful in person. it ever-so-slightly flares out and it definitely has that 70s feel. i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown. for reference: 5'7/got some hips and thighs/148lbs - and i got a medium. would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter.,1,Dresses
I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans  but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.,1,Intimates
The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it  the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of,1,Sweaters
"These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4"" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans  not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.",1,Jeans

Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s  but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school)  and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings  but its not too bulky so i can keep it on,1,Lounge

Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me  that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes  but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it  not because it's see-through at all (it's not)  but because of the static.     also  this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.,1,Dresses

The shirt fits nice and has a classic cut. i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone. the shirt is soft and comfortable  but is rather thin and see through. the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas. wouldn't pay full price for it  but it's worth it on sale.,1,Knits
I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really  nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am  5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it  would have ruined the details of the dress. they were  backordered on petites in my size  so  i just returned it.,1,Dresses

The material is soft and the length is great. you can wear it with short or skinny jeans. the only drawback is the color because it is so light. it is pastel so if you like pastels it will be great for you.,1,Jackets
I have a different perspective than the other reviewers. the fabric is thin - and silky -perfect for summer! it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet. i bought the small  which i typically wear. it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals. finally  it has pockets!!!!,1,Dresses
Pilcro is an incredible denim brand and i've never been disappointed. these are no exception. minimal distress  perfect length (i'm 5'8 and they hit just like the model)  great color and super comfy! they have some stretch to them and definitely fit baggier  so depending on how you want them to fit...i sized down for a snugger fit. these are fantastic!,1,Jeans

Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus  i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!,1,Knits

This skirt is the perfect flirty denim piece for the summer.   it's light weight but good quality.   the only draw back is the waist is quite fitted when zipped.   had to size up.    it's like a pencil skirt on top  which does make it tough to tuck anything in unless it's very thin.   overall  charming skirt.   do love.,1,Skirts

Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish  comfortable  and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally  i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model)  dark denim  olive green  and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.,1,Knits

I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,1,Knits

This dress is gorgeous. the quality is high  runs true to size  and is very flattering! my only issue is the tule. i already have hips  so the tule makes the dress over-flare. i am going to have the tailor remove the tule and it will be perfect. for those who are not an hourglass shape naturally  this will help provide the extra shaping.  overall  i love this dress and will be keeping it.,1,Dresses
