"I usually wear stevie's in ag  but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and i""m so glad i did! they came today and i tried them on  i will say the rise feels a little higher than mid-rise  but it's so soft and stretchy i didn't really care. they're definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesn't fit quite so tightly. the color/wash is great too. for this price  these are awesome. i ordered a 29  same as my stevies and it fit per",1,Jeans
This gem is beyond lovely! i saw this 5 years ago and regretted not buying it 5 years ago and then i was looking on here as i do on a weekly basis and bam it was there  i gasped hahahaha but really this is an amazing statement piece. i am usually a l but got the m as it is a bit big and its your preference on how you want to wear it. i will be wearing this to death for autumn winter and forever its just one of those. soft and not itchy and i have sensitive skin.,1,Sweaters
I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!,0,Blouses
I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference  i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out.     however  my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine  that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of,0,Skirts
"I've been looking for sometime for a spring/summer jacket to wear on warm days over light clothing. i wanted something feminine and just structured enough to move beyond casual. this fits the ticket! it is a very pale grey and a soft  cozy fabric. i am 5'8"" tall and 118 lbs  and usually wear an xs in many items but a s in jackets due to the shoulders. these shoulders were large on me in the s. the waist was also large  but worth having it altered. if you find this on sale it's a great buy!",1,Jackets
Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it  you will have it forever!,1,Blouses
I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute  but missed the mark.,0,Dresses
"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight",0,Fine gauge
Overall  very nice pair of boyfriend style jeans. super comfy. i asked one of the in store stylist for help styling them- she was very helpful and showed me lots of possibilities for these pants. also good for a post-partum tummy :),1,Jeans
This is a beautiful and warm sweater  well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing  especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.,0,Sweaters
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.,0,Dresses
Dark burgundy sweater  cable pattern in front (subtle; hard to see online) embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section. beautiful fall sweater.  soft and comfortable. looks great with skinny jeans  would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants.  beautiful color.  slightly roomy fit (not fitted  but not boxy)...true to general size. love this for fall and winter.  flattering  comfortable  unique.,1,Fine gauge
You would expect anything woolen to be slightly scratchy. this is incredibly soft. i couldn't belive it's veltevty soft texture when i pulled it out of the carton. i had to check the content ag immediately to comfim. the cut is not too fussy but slimming and the sleeves are nice and long. it was a little dissapointing that the usual attention to the styling on the back of the piece was missing here. it's a straight  plain back with no darts  plackets  peplums or ruching.,1,Sweaters
I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.,0,Sweaters
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,0,Skirts
I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t,0,Pants
I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me  more orange than a true coral. but for summer  is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference  i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small  my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral  i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little  but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee  with yoga pants ,1,Lounge
Looks great on the model  but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.,0,Fine gauge
This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it  and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy  it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases  and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.,1,Knits
I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.,1,Dresses
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!,0,Pants
I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on  however  you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5'2  so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture  but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now  all i need is the sun!,1,Swim
The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.,0,Blouses
I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0  and that was better. it runs wide  the lining is true to size  but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty  the design is nice  but i didn't love it as much as other ones.    likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).    no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.    115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist... 00p,1,Dresses
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,0,Fine gauge
The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size  figure flattering  and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece  this is it!,1,Blouses
I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!,1,Dresses
This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.,0,Sweaters
The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately  these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for,1,Shorts
"Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design  nice weight fabric (no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1""  120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!  this is a keeper.",1,Blouses
I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick  and the pattern is just ok. didn't do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.,0,Dresses
This top is an easy  classy staple for summer -tts and drapes well  great shape,1,Knits
This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight  easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer  but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small  and it fit perfectly - not tight  not too loose...honestly  if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!,1,Fine gauge
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.,0,Knits
I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line  the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer  so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to,1,Blouses
I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,1,Blouses
It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.,0,Knits
Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably  looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow  gives it a vintage vibe.,1,Dresses
I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s,0,Knits
I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar  but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome  the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c  broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting  it would be a perfect top! soft  cool fabric  great for summer.,1,Blouses
Based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.,0,Dresses
"You do not want to know how many cropped  wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right  apparently. these are great: comfy  make my legs look cute  not chopped off  they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.    i bought",1,Jeans
I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan,0,Dresses
"I am 5' 4 1/2""  125 lbs.  and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also  i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color  but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online.",0,Sweaters
"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top  but longer in the skirt! yes  please! i purchased the turquoise  which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference  i'm 5'6""  136 lbs and ordered a size small.",1,Dresses
"The dress fit fine  with two exceptions. first  i am 5'1""  and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground  so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure  which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective  so sent it back  but unfortunately  the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit",0,Dresses
Would have loved this skirt  but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!,0,Skirts
I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c,0,Blouses
This knit shirt is too thin  as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white  and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me  and was actually too long. had to return  especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs   which normally fits me.,0,Knits
I love this tunic. i am 22 weeks pregnant and the large fit great. i wish it were a little longer but will be great with leggings and perfect for the fall/winter seasons.,1,Fine gauge
I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress it really is so pretty but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly the cut is not right for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection,0,Dresses
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!,1,Dresses
I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.,0,Dresses

These weren't what i expected  but i kind of really like them. they have a very high rise  and so they end up being high waisted. the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable. however  the fabric is very stretchy  and i'm not sure i can wear them to work. but they're a little fancy for the weekend. the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black. all things i can work with  but they are a little different than i imagined. they are quite long -- i'm 5'8 and will likely have to,0,Pants

As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou,0,Fine gauge
Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but  they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem  but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also  while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest  almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent,0,Dresses
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,0,Dresses
Like others  i was drawn to the collar  fabric and overall look to it....  ________  pros:  - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.  - collar is so classy  but i am drawn to anything with a collar.  - pockets are a nice touch.  _______  cons:  - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.  - runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large,0,Dresses

"This dress is beautiful. this is a 0 and tts. it was not clingy or tight at all (5'4"" 115lbs). it is fully lined  and i have short legs  so it was not too short for me. if you have an event you could wear this to this summer  i highly recommend.",1,Dresses
These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall  but run large. depending on cut/style  i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these  and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero  but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!,0,Shorts
This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.,0,Dresses
This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said  great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.,1,Intimates
"I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic  but in person  it really caught my eye.",1,Knits
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,0,Blouses

This dress intrigued me a bit online  but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack  i wasn't so sure about it  but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh  flattering  flowy  light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric  the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist  but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great,1,Dresses
This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color  but frankly  that's about it.,0,Knits
First of all  the colors are really pretty  fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested  this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid  it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.,0,Dresses
I love everything about this dress. the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement. i got this in a 0p after reading review  and am usually a 00p-0p. the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable. i agree with other reviews that the top is larger. my measurements are 31-24-34...and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and,1,Dresses

I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.,0,Dresses

The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.,0,Sweaters

This dress is pretty  but there were a few things i disliked.    the overdress is fairly shapeless; however  the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer  the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress  the slip  and the lace. finally  as other reviewers have shared  the buttons are not functional  and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.     i recommend trying the dress,0,Dresses
This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft  but poor material. not my favorite purchase.,0,Lounge

I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said  i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we  it is more of a nude color  but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will,1,Dresses

I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/2 inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.,1,Dresses

"I love this dress! i was apprehensive about it at first  because of the light material and boxy style. turns out the material is very flattering  and it hangs very well. the style isn't as boxy as it seems. it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesn't fit like a tent. i am 5'4"" and i ordered the petite. it's short enough to show off you legs  but not too short. for being less fitting  i like the balance of the short length  and it looks great with heeled boo",1,Dresses
I typically wear xs or s  or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big  it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.,1,Sweaters
I loved the idea of this dress  but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting  but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft  but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.,0,Dresses

I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats  and the cowl neck is loose and fluid  so it lays well. the only complaint i had  and it's minor  is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit  which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).,1,Dresses

This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still,0,Fine gauge
Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.,0,Knits
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,1,Blouses

Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses
I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.,0,Blouses

I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it  it's the cutest suit ever.,1,Swim

I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet  so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.,1,Blouses
Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments.   unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine  ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!,1,Fine gauge
I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.,0,Blouses

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters
And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,0,Fine gauge

I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.,0,Skirts
Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.,0,Swim

This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.,0,Trend
I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but  after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12  so this was definitely a maxi on me. but  there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add,1,Dresses

I agree with the other reviewer  the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.,1,Jackets
This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.,0,Knits

I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs. the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular. i am 5'4 size 2. the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect. the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable.,1,Dresses
I ordered this dress in a size 8  my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person.,0,Dresses
This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite  straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod,1,Dresses

This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t,0,Dresses

This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.,0,Dresses

I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per,0,Dresses

"First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5"" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price.",0,Knits
Yes  this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves  but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color  and after getting compliments  i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear  have an interesting detail at the neck  and could be layered. cozy  comfortable  stylish. love mine!,1,Knits

The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly  the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.,0,Dresses
This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!,0,Knits

I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.,0,Knits

I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.,0,Knits

Just bought this today and i love it. so simple  and at the same time it's not. the fabric makes it casual to dress up or down  but the shape of it is incredible and what takes it above simple. the straps felt a little long  so i will likely get it altered to be shortened in the straps. got the red and it's gorgeous.,1,Dresses
I'm normally an xl  but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body  but not tight-fitting  just as shown on the model.    the detailing at the shoulders is heavy  compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so  it pulls the neckline forward a bit.     i bought the red and wow! it's a bright  fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled.,1,Knits

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses
