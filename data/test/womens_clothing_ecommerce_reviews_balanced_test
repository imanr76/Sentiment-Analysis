Cute and comfy. looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too. fabric and fit are great!,1,Lounge
I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much  went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin  it's super soft and just the perfect length.,1,Knits
"This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher",0,Lounge
Very comfortable to wear  love the overall look of this dress.,1,Dresses
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee,1,Sweaters
My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.,0,Pants
I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like,0,Pants
The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!,0,Knits
Thank you retailer for a collection that includes dressy mid-length dresses suitable for special occasions! the simplistic beauty  quality of workmanship  and form fitting style of this dress is perfect. the fit and flare enhances curves and hides flaws. it pairs perfectly with the necklace shown and a cropped lace front cardigan that i found elsewhere. admittedly  i am not sure that younger clients would be happy with the tea length  but i am ecstatic!,1,Dresses
Got this on sale in black and red  and have only worn the black. quality is poor  seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.,0,Knits
"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of",0,Fine gauge
"I love everything about this sweater. it's well made  the color is lovely  and best of all  i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel ""overexposed"" in the back. i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless  but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant. a must buy at this great price!",1,Sweaters
"Again  nope. looks chic on the model  looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe",0,Dresses
I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless,1,Knits
The blue has three colors of stripes: blue  white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model  not tight but form fitting.,0,Knits
I felt like a 12 year old wearing my big sister's dress. it's a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large  hitting below my knees. the top part fits my large  34g chest nicely but it becomes a wide a-line through the hips. the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesn't flow softly over the body. the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward.  i love the black and white stripes. very striking. would love a top in these colors and fabric ,1,Dresses
"Love these jeans!! i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away! i ordered the 26 regular. yes  they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2""# for flats  but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2"" - 3"" to wear with these). the fit is comfortable  they stretch just enough to look nice and still move with you. they are not binding at all.  the first time i wore them i got so many compliments. i even had a friend tell me she did not understand why flares were coming back because she t",1,Jeans

"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it ",0,Dresses
I would of paid double the amount for this romper. i am a medium and the medium fits perfect. i am a little long in the torso  so some rompers aren't comfortable but this one is! this is going to be a summer staple for sure.,1,Pants
Several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles. it is not embroidered  but an attractive popsicle print. i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p. a bit roomy in waist  but with tie at waist it works. length great  but arm holes large. will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering.,1,Dresses

Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!,0,Dresses
I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did  it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.    very bummed  but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers,0,Dresses
"I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6""  between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!",1,Dresses

As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou,0,Fine gauge

Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s  but that would be cutting it  especially since i'm 5ft 11in  133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.,1,Sweaters
This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.,0,Dresses

I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.,0,Sweaters
Picked this up end of season sale  but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto,1,Knits
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.,0,Blouses
Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.,0,Pants
Got this in the red  like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug.  you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit.    other than that  super comfortable and soft fabric,1,Knits

Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches  38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top  and that works perfectly with the design.,1,Knits
This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch  the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all  so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality  i would definitely look into other items from this brand  but back this dress went.,0,Dresses

I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.     my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress  i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink  i would've hand wa,0,Dresses

"Seeking the perfect ""go-to"" dress? this one will work for day or night  and it's an ideal match for transition seasons. the best part? the cut. swing dresses and shifts can ""tent"" my slightly ""top-heavy"" frame. this dress brags a side-zipper and slight tapering through waist to create an a-line. the small petite fits tts for me at 5'4 size 2 to 4. the fabric is a high-quality  textured fabric - wrinkle free  and a great pick for travel. best investment i've made this spring.",1,Dresses

This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle  which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.,1,Dresses
This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l  but went with the m  and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.,1,Blouses
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,0,Blouses
Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement,0,Sweaters
This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.,0,Pants

I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.,0,Dresses

I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy  and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this  but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall  then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees  and i am shorter than the model. regardless  i am thrilled with my purchase!,1,Dresses

L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place  but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.,0,Swim
Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits
Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.,0,Knits

I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,0,Intimates
This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't,0,Dresses

"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this  and we have very different body types.

I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0,Dresses

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters

This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur,0,Blouses

This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on,0,Dresses

This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,0,Blouses

At 46 years old  i still like fun  hip  fashionable items  but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!,1,Jackets

I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.  it runs a little big  so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side  but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.,1,Jackets
This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut  and that the buttons are covered. however  the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly  i don't think i can recommend this shirt  though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body  but it still looks great. i hope this helps!,0,Blouses
Tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems - 1. not made for c cup bra women or larger and 2. the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest  so when you see yourself at a profile view  there's these ruffles that look like they're coming out of your chest. just sayin'. not for me.,0,Dresses

This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.,0,Knits

I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews  i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately  it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest  and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.,0,Knits

This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,1,Sweaters
Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up  mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all  so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband  but i don't think that can be prevented.,1,Pants

I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!,0,Lounge
As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0,Skirts

I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.,0,Blouses

I love bows   this dress is very cute and flattering  while being comfortable. it may be sleeveless  but i think with the right boots and cardigan  it can be brought into fall easily. color is a nice green. i tried on both the 00p and 0p  and though i loved the fit of the 00p better (width)  i preferred the length of the 0p - otherwise  not much difference there... i think it is well worth keeping it  even though i don't need yet another dress... material is pretty comfortable too. back is lower,1,Dresses

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses

Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel,0,Dresses

This is a cute sweater that can be very versatile. i love to wear it to work with a dress pant as well as with jeans on the weekends. it is soft and looks great on. would recommend.,1,Sweaters
Everything about the dress is worth it. it's true the buttons are loosely sewn on  but that's easily fixed. i'm a slim person but broad in the shoulders  so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow  fitted construction. large-chested ladies or athletic types should size up.,1,Dresses
Wow  i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank  i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy.   would totally buy different colors if it came in others  but i'm no,1,Blouses
I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.,0,Blouses
This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.,0,Skirts
I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,0,Jackets

Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,0,Fine gauge
Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.,0,Sweaters
Beautiful color  bought a small (i am 5'10 and 145 pounds  the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me) however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought  i am only a 34b. i'm returning it. i did think it was pricey for what you get as well. the color was by far the best thing about this dress  it could have been better quality and fit.,1,Dresses
I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.,0,Knits

This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size  the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it  too  is defective,0,Dresses
I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find  that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull  it was really large in the body. in addition  while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.,0,Dresses
This top is adorable. normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews  and glad i did. still really loose but so cute. would have preferred petite but sold out.,1,Knits
Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.,0,Dresses
This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.,0,Sweaters
I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.,0,Sweaters
Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile  as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short  be prepared to have the hem taken up.     worth the buy!,1,Dresses

O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.,0,Dresses
This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.,0,Blouses

I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a,0,Shorts
I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.,0,Pants
I got this in peach  and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee  over a dress  over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers  but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!,1,Jackets

This top is so cute it's my go to top. dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt. i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey. one great thing this top has pockets. i would buy this in many colors if i could. yes it's full but a cute full. but i love full tops. i think this is true to size it's not tight and i don't think it would be as cute tight. i actually like mine on me better than the one on the model.lol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer.,1,Knits
I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.,0,Blouses

I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect ,0,Jeans

I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,0,Dresses

I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee,0,Knits

This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling  which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone),1,Dresses

I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,0,Shorts

I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,0,Jeans

"I really wanted to like this top  but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips  or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top  without feeling like you're in a ""crop top""",0,Blouses
This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.,0,Dresses

The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri,0,Blouses

This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0,Blouses

I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!,0,Knits
I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(,0,Dresses

I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.,0,Blouses

Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight  allows no room for extra tummy  hips  booty  or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top)  but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m  would have definitely sized up  as i really liked the look.,0,Pants
I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately  but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.    i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.,1,Blouses
