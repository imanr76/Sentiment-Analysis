Like all maeve tops of this nature  i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue  the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!)  and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops  but i do not have one in a color like this,1,Blouses
I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.,0,Dresses
"The suit is beautiful  however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight  to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing  i ordered a medium  i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa",0,Swim
The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!,0,Dresses
I was looking for a classic  white t-shirt that wasn't too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it's not too tight  but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d  size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!,1,Knits
What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....  the sleeves are very long and very boxy... i have no idea the condition of this on store  but came with damages on sleeves also  we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that  i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!  dissipointed!!!! ;(,0,Sweaters
I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy  but other than that it's perfect!,1,Intimates
"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4""  curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because  being sale items  only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty  but eh on me. however  the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it.",0,Dresses
So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight  the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue)  the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately  i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g)  so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular  which hopefully will have a little more room  but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!,0,Dresses
I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.,1,Dresses
This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold  mint/teal and grey/dark gray.,1,Fine gauge

I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs  i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t,1,Dresses
I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!    please  retailer  expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly.,1,Blouses
The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer. i sent it back .,0,Fine gauge
This poncho is very pretty and unique.it does run very over-sized  however that's how it is styled to be. the embroidery is very nice  it does sit back on the should a little further than pictured. the open weave is a little looser than the picture seems and you will need to wear something under it (cami; tank; body shaper). probably will pick or snag pretty easily also. the longer hem in the back is cute  but if you are on the shorter side you may not like where it hits. it will look best with,1,Sweaters
Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they  firstly  aren't eloise like i assumed they would be  and secondly  that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure  but i'm,0,Sleep

"Love this shirt...got it in the ""blue"" but i will say the print is a very dark navy  almost black. i'm 130 lbs  34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!",1,Blouses
This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.,1,Dresses
This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin  but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray  but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :),1,Knits
I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer  but will never again buy another sweater here.,0,Fine gauge
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,0,Swim

I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately  when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.    it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th,0,Knits
As soon as i put the dress on i had to buy it! i felt like it looked and fit really well on. the dress pictured is an 8 and was a bit baggy up top. i'm a 32c so i purchased a 6 and it fits like a glove. i'm 5'8 and it hits just above the knee.,1,Dresses
I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.  this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.,1,Fine gauge
"This sweater is a grand-dad style sweater. i love the pattern of the fabric. it does run a bit large  especially in the length of the sleeves. it definitely fits a more ""oversized"" sort of look. i find it very comfortable & perfect for a casual/weekend outfit.",1,Knits
I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller  it would work for you.,0,Knits
Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!,1,Jeans

This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made  heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool  buy it. if not  pass on it.,0,Sweaters
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,1,Fine gauge
Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin  so it works as a swim cover  but definitely not a dress for anything else.,0,Lounge
I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but  then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.,1,Dresses
"I love this dress  saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day. this dress is perfect! the pattern stands out but isn't too overwhelming. i'm 5'4"" 120lbs and 32ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit. it's just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive. one thing i've found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort. seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up!",1,Dresses
This is one of those pieces of clothing that is destined to become a wardrobe staple. the fabric is soft and generous. . the chiffon trim gives it swing and style. i just ordered another one because i know it is going to be a long time favorite..,1,Layering
"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash  and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes  go with your larger size.  this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight  so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say  a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b",1,Blouses

Beautiful and good quality dress. the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline.  you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it.  unlike the model  i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me.,0,Dresses
As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0,Skirts
These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though  i love many of retailer shorts  these are one of my favorites.,1,Shorts
Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!,1,Legwear
I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on  but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so  if you have wide hips  this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l  it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.,0,Dresses
"This dress is super comfortable. it's s bit long  but i'm 5'3""  so that's to be expected. i wanted an everyday dress and i can't decide if the full skirt makes it too formal looking.",1,Dresses
This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress  but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night  but since i have enough date dresses  and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.,1,Dresses
I really was uncertain when ordering these because linen can be difficult. these are actually very flowy and soft. i do think they run a bit large. the petite sizes sold out so i ordered a regular 27. it stretched out a bit too much by the end of the day. if that's the case  you need to be careful because the hook and tiny belt are going to struggle to keep up. you should consider ordering down if you are in between sizes. otherwise  the rose color is beautiful  accurate to the website  and work,1,Pants
Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!,0,Pants
I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so  when i saw this on sale  with an extra 30% off  i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns  the hi-lo feature (very subtle)  and the tie back. so cute!  if you're petite like me  though  you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.,1,Blouses
Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,0,Skirts

"Love the crushed velvet and tried it on in the regular sizing in blue  but really needed the petite. although i tried on the xs in the regular sizing  i was afraid i'd need my normal sp  so i ordered that instead of the xsp. should have stuck with the xsp and will be exchanging it for that size. it definitely is dress length (but dowdy dress length in the regular for me at 5'1"") and the petite sizing is not all that much shorter  but enough to be cute. expecting a lot of use  especially over the",1,Dresses
I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well  more so in dresses than tops. also  it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity  but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also  the length is nice  close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr,1,Dresses
I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.,1,Knits
The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.,0,Dresses
This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind  it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.,1,Dresses
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,0,Jeans
Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length wouldn't be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique  by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and  subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.,0,Dresses
I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12  so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides  it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them)  then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol,0,Sweaters

I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i,0,Dresses

I love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary. this tops does that for me: the black is a rich dark charcoal grey  the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well. however  the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff (my problem) area. since i love it so much  i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large. it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline.,1,Knits

I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual  paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner  plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect  though  is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon  which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li,0,Dresses

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses

The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,0,Fine gauge

The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,0,Swim

I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful  intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt  with the shirt getting wider and more,0,Knits
The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.,0,Knits
I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color  pattern  slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.,1,Dresses
This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty  this is great  but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy  but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra  which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly  so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy  which i liked very muc,0,Pants

Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.,0,Sweaters

"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!",0,Fine gauge
At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,0,Jackets
This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!,0,Dresses
These pilcro's jeans are so good!!! love the fit  the color  and the feel. i am a curvy girl and these are great  they hit me just right. now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problem.i wore these jeans at work for 10 hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size  so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable. i think these are a no brainer!,1,Jeans
I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture  feel great on  don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.,1,Lounge
"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill-fitting sack.",0,Trend
"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it's warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!",1,Sweaters
I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build,0,Fine gauge
I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts  capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.,1,Knits
I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving  make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.,1,Dresses
I initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory. as other reviewers have said  it's not the softest sweater you'll try on. if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model  you may need to size down. while i love the style  it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so i've been careful getting it on and off. i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale. the quality is of the yarn is just of,1,Sweaters
I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago. i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color. i love it! i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall. it has a substantial weight and is warm. this sweater/poncho has a great drape that is really flattering  especially in the back. it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath. i've worn it with a turtleneck and button-ups and it looks rea,1,Sweaters
The minute i put this sweater on  i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so  for those with any type of sensitivity to wool  this is not the sweater for you. otherwise  i thought the design was quite cute.,0,Sweaters
I usually wear a small  4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.,0,Dresses
The pattern  while beautiful  is on a much more yellow-ivory background than pictured. the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose  like it would not support the skirt. while i did like it  i didn't love it  so it had to go back.,1,Skirts
I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.,0,Sweaters
I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person  not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.,1,Fine gauge
I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version  but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.,0,Knits
"These pants are really great! the fabric is soft  but substantial  and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey  almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5""  124 lb. and purchased the small.",1,Pants
"I love this dress  i mean it si really pretty in person  however  the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it  and my ""older"" breasts just droop  not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that  but if you are smaller up there  i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs  26.5 ion waist  30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.    colors and fabric are great  i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad.",0,Dresses
Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!,1,Blouses
I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,0,Pants
The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s,0,Blouses
The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.,0,Skirts
I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i didn't like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.,0,Knits
"I really liked these pants! they are so audrey hepburn. i especially like how they come up high on my waist. i actually bought 3 different pairs of ""essential"" pants and kept all of them. (essential taper and essential slim). i stated that these run small but they just seem to run smaller than the other two. i'm 5'3"" and they are a touch longer than i'd like but that is an easy fix. for reference  i'm 110 lbs and bought size 2 in these and 0 in the others",1,Pants
But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.,0,Knits
The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought,0,Sweaters
I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn't like the material either.,0,Dresses
This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.,0,Dresses
