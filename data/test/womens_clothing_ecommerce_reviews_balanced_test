Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.,1,Outerwear
I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.,0,Knits
This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on,0,Dresses
This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.,0,Knits
This was my go to dress this past summer. so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges. perfect to dress up or down.,1,Dresses
Online  this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact  i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.,0,Fine gauge
This sweater is pretty  fits tts  feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures  i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think,1,Sweaters
I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart,0,Blouses
"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10""  and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model  and the cut was just too wide under the armpits.",0,Blouses
Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.,1,Sweaters
I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.,1,Sweaters
I'm a huge skort fan from way back  but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack  so when i saw this on line i was excited  and when i saw it in the store  my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish  functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft  so it hangs in a flattering manner  instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea,1,Shorts
I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.,0,Knits
Purchased this maxi dress in blue print  size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model  but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.,1,Dresses
Love the softness of this sweater - it's very flattering without feeling like i am swimming in it. like the other reviewer said - it sheds a lot! the cream is very sheer so i had to wear a tank underneath.,1,Fine gauge
I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.,0,Dresses
This top is awesome. i purchased the gold color in a small. fits perfectly and true to size; sleeves are nice and long. definitely recommend!,1,Knits
This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.,0,Dresses

I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed  but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft  not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through!

Love this skirt  beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so,1,Skirts
I had been searching for an almost 50s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it. i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be. i got the green one with the white dots. very comfortable  it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very 50s styling--it makes the waist look more narrow...,1,Dresses
This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.,1,Dresses
I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.,0,Skirts
"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",0,Fine gauge
The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon  unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also  the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.,1,Dresses
"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8""  155 lbs)  would look great on someone more slender.",0,Dresses
I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size  and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!,1,Blouses

"This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i can't wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin  and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also  it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7""). other than that  i love this dress.",1,Dresses
"I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me  this dress fit terribly. however  the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3"" and about 117 with a really short torso  and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller  or maybe with a longer torso  i could see this dress being really lovely.",0,Dresses
Skirt fit perfectly  nice construction - hidden zipper  full lining - nicely done. would love to see it in navy or black.,1,Skirts
"I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to  but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the ""sagging out"" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.  i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo",1,Jeans
Don't get me wrong  this is probably cute on someone else  but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed  it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this  size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.,0,Knits
Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights  but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!,1,Knits
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy,0,Dresses
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly  it fits me very well (i'm 5'2""  34b  26 waist  36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much  and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way  the fabric is super soft (but not w",1,Blouses
I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since. if you wait long enough  everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable  the perfect length  can dress up or down and are very  very cute.,1,Pants
When i saw this top online i loved it  and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops  and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer  but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is  if you a little busty  the neckline might dip a tiny bit,1,Blouses
This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through  but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.,1,Knits
This is one fabulous-looking dress; however  the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up  to see if that would help  but it was still too scratchy for me.,0,Dresses
This shirt drapes beautifully. forgiving fabric in a beautiful taupe. it is a bit low cut  i wear a camisole underneath. true to size.,1,Knits
Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy  as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts  so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.,1,Knits
"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",0,Dresses
I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick  stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!,0,Knits

Bought this dress online and it came in missing a button. the dress is really pretty  and comes with a tan linen slip. i bought a size down because the dress runs a little large. also the sleeves are kind of puffy but overall the dress is elegant and pretty.,1,Dresses
I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected  which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however  i did keep it because,0,Knits

I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,1,Outerwear
This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it's a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i don't think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.,1,Dresses
I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.,0,Blouses
I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it  and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear  but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking  i am able to wear my regular bra under it  and the straps don't hang out.,1,Blouses
I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.,0,Lounge
I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also  it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem  i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.,0,Outerwear
Great cut & fit! the length is perfect  too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.,1,Skirts
The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice  it makes them look wide and short. well  that might be why these are percect for me  but on my body type (muscular bottom)  they are awesome. the material is stretchy  soft  and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color  so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs  i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly  but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal,1,Pants

"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern  but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s  and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey  and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference  i'm 5'4""  120 lbs).",0,Sweaters
I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever. i wear it with a tank top underneath so i haven't noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned.   i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear it.  i wish i had it in the blue color too!,1,Knits
I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe  and while the color didn't disappoint  everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin  i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear  but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...,0,Knits

I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.,0,Dresses
I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso  this would work great. if not  unfortunately  its not great - tear,0,Knits
I love tiny tops- they fit great. i buy a small. i wish this was a henly style like some of their past versions of this embroidered style top but i still ike it and will get a lot of wear out of it. at first i thought it was too much detal but it grew on me after pulling an outfit together. won't dissapoint.,1,Knits

This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl,0,Knits

This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft  embroidery beautiful  fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction  and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color  most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas  any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.,1,Blouses
This dress is easy to wear  lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason  the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although  to be fair  i am small-chested).,1,Dresses

This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.,0,Blouses
I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r,0,Jeans
I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however  i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.,0,Knits
I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks. it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works,0,Dresses

The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,0,Jeans

"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right  not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted  but it's not).",1,Knits

While this top does fit very loose  it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up. it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look. i bought the green color and it is a very rich color  it will be perfect for fall! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose.,1,Knits

I bought the pink  which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body  which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye,1,Knits
