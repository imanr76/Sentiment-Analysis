In the on-line picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it. when it arrived  i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt! it was equally comfortable on. the rayon  tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel  that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing week-end or evening. i ordered the size 3 even though i usually order a small in most tops. this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look  and i was right about t,1,Knits
I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest  so it's not meant to be fitted  so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops  i went with the xs in this  and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great  very versatile  simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!,1,Jackets
I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m,0,Swim
This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack  so it's going back.,0,Knits
"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and bought this in size medium because i have long arms and was afraid that the cashmere would shrink even if i hand-wash and dry flat (because let's be honest--i doubt i'll ever send it to the dry cleaner). it's loose through the body and arms  but the sleeves are the perfect length. the term ""bell sleeve"" is no exaggeration. the sleeves are billowy and voluminous and i can see them getting in the way while washing my hands or doing dishes. i guess i will have to reserve this s",1,Sweaters
This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top  bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small  but it was a little snug in the arms. however  the small was too big  so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite  but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.,1,Dresses
Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.,0,Outerwear
This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.,0,Lounge
I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding  and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.,1,Dresses

This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.,0,Blouses
I ordered a size up after reading the reviews  but i wouldn't of had to. it's not a snug fit at all. although  i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands.,1,Knits
This top is so darling  the different textures are so elegant that you really don't even need to accessorize. it has a very flattering cut and a must for any figure.,1,Knits
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.,0,Knits
Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.,0,Knits
Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.,0,Blouses
I did the happy dance when the dress arrived  but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately  instead of following my instincts  i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake  as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7  130lbs  34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul,1,Dresses

1st  this jacket fits true to size. 2nd  the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing)  as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material  so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.    i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility.,1,Outerwear
"I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot  hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich  vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6"" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.",1,Dresses
I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur,0,Pants
I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy  but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they don't hold up  i love them that much.,1,Lounge
The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.,0,Knits
This cardigan is just the right length  i.e. not too long as so many are these days. but the sleeves are ridiculously long. will have to shorten them for sure. fabric is definitely not heavy. pretty color. i do like it overall..,1,Fine gauge
This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.,0,Sweaters
I just love the print on this shirt!  it is so feminine and pretty!  the material is very soft!  i took my usual medium.  a great addition to my spring wardrobe!,1,Knits
These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties  i love the rise  and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had)  and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.,1,Jeans
I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.,0,Jeans

"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter  like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down  the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here  is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st",0,Dresses

I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,0,Intimates

This dress is really cute in person. however  it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot  but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa,0,Dresses

I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec,0,Knits
I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.,0,Dresses

I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.,0,Knits
I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized  so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust  which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that  especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit.     the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w,1,Knits

I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!,0,Knits

This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,0,Intimates

This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,1,Outerwear

I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,0,Jeans

I wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no  i didn't buy too small  and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.,0,Blouses
I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy  so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all  its a fun dress!,0,Dresses

I love mixed media clothing  and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away  and after being torn between the two colors  opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however  as soon as i put it on  i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd)  but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.,1,Sweaters
"How has nobody reviewed these pants yet?! love them! they're more like really nice  structured leggings  but thick enough to be substantial pants. they're stretchy  hold their shape  flattering on my big hips and thighs  and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants  which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt. the only bad--and it wasn't even really that bad--is that these are longer than the 27"" advertised. i'm 5'5"" ",1,Pants
I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.,0,Blouses

Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!,0,Dresses
This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.,0,Dresses
I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.,0,Dresses
This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.,0,Dresses
Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve  so hopefully it holds up.,1,Knits
I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,0,Jeans

This is such beautiful material  but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress  and now it's going back.,0,Dresses

I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,0,Fine gauge
I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s  and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me  but i'll wear a cami under it.,1,Blouses

Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants
I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party  i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved  so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!,1,Knits

I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit  i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.,1,Lounge

I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.,0,Knits
Ugh  i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique  but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling  the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!,0,Knits
I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,1,Skirts

I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters,0,Sweaters
I love this dress - originally ordered the medium  which is my normal size  especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping  and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model  and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect.     i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price  this would have been nice.,1,Dresses
