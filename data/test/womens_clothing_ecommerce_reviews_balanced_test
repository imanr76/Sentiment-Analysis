I'm pretty flat-chested (34aa) so it's hard for me to say how the sizing runs on this top for others. to me  it's a slim fitting but not tight  true to size t-shirt. i tried the xs regular (dressing room photo) and the small petite (other photo) and i'd say the main fit difference was in the shoulders. the small petite fit me better in the shoulders (xs petite wasn't available). also the neckline of the small petite came up a little higher. the white is a slightly dingy off-white but i think the,1,Knits
I love this dress! its feminine  sassy and very comfortable. it fit my body type well--i'd say i have more of an athletic build (broad shoulders  36c  straight in waist/hips) plus i have a lovely left over tummy from two babies.... the top has stretch and is a higher waist which is slimming on my body. the bottom material is a thick and high quality with a design that is beautiful in person. it sits out from my waist and hips and easily covers the left over tummy and is super easy to move in. po,1,Dresses
I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.,0,Dresses
The material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well.  when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out. it made me look much bigger than i am.  i ordered a large (normally i wear lg or xl) and it's possible a medium would have fit better. unfortunately this shirt had to be returned.,0,Knits
This is great without a belt  with or without leggings. it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted  big behind women (like me).,1,Dresses
This poncho is very pretty and unique.it does run very over-sized  however that's how it is styled to be. the embroidery is very nice  it does sit back on the should a little further than pictured. the open weave is a little looser than the picture seems and you will need to wear something under it (cami; tank; body shaper). probably will pick or snag pretty easily also. the longer hem in the back is cute  but if you are on the shorter side you may not like where it hits. it will look best with,1,Sweaters
"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",0,Dresses
I wanted to love this dress. i've been looking for a cute  flattering red dress for ages and snapped this up on sale online  thinking it was finally the one. when i tried it on i found the shape flattering  even to my recently pregnant figure. other than that  i was highly disappointed for two reasons. one  quality issues  as mentioned by a previous reviewer - the slip is sewn in totally unevenly  resulting in it sticking up above the neckline on one side  with several threads poking up above th,0,Dresses
Fell in love with this romper online  but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large  i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering  delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium  but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.,1,Shorts
Cute skort but seems to run big. it's also sort of long for shorts (the model must have much longer legs than me). i may try a size smaller since i love the print but i'm not optimistic.,0,Shorts
"Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).",0,Fine gauge

I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious  wonderful for fall or winter  and the gold  gray  and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus  pockets! however  the midi length did not work for me  despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length  just above the knee. i'm not,0,Skirts
"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side  but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!",0,Knits
I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou,0,Jeans
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,1,Dresses
Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,0,Blouses
I ordered two colors and was happy with them both.  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer.  i like a layered look  and having layers to peel as needed.  these tops are great on their own as well!  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length.  really love the fabric too!,1,Knits
This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric  beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful  elegant dress for the hot weather.,1,Dresses
Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric  meaning the dress  is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.  the dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the,0,Dresses
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.,1,Dresses

"This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and hap",1,Sleep
As a busty but small-waisted girl  i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however  it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable  and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact  it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.,1,Dresses

I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light  but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape  and while the fit is on the loose side  it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color  and it's divine. definitely worth the price.,1,Fine gauge
"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first  i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second  the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally  the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.",0,Sweaters

"I'm 5'8 - 38""?30""?38"" - i bought these leggings in a size large (blue motif) to wear under a really cozy organic cotton tunic in an attempt to create a sophisticated-looking  comfortable look. when i first it them on they felt like compression leggings and i wondered if they were too small. i wore them for a day and now they are falling down around the waist and the crotch is hanging. i spend so much time trying to hike them back up - i'm not at all comfortable and i doubt i'm looking sophistica",1,Pants
"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy  thin  and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back  it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",0,Dresses
This top is prettier in person than on the picture. the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap - it actually looks nice in person. it's very comfy and feminine  showing just the right amount of skin on the arms. the elastic on the waist also makes me look 3 lbs. lighter. it goes good with jeans or skirts.,1,Knits
"The model looks awesome in this cute top  but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference  i'm 5'7 "" 140 lbs.  and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric  yet the back is stretchy. in theory  it's pretty  but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.",0,Knits
This dress is even better in person! i am usually a size 2 and i went up to a 4. it is my favorite dress this spring! it is so cute with booties or sandals. i would say that it runs slightly small  so you should get the next size up if you're busty or have hips. it has been selling fast  you should get it while you can! :),1,Dresses

Love this  but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic  the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it,0,Sleep
This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave  or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau,1,Dresses
This was pretty to look at: nice weight  lining  colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great  so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me  though...,0,Dresses
I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but  for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.,0,Dresses
"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4""  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.",0,Dresses

This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight  easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer  but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small  and it fit perfectly - not tight  not too loose...honestly  if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!,1,Fine gauge

I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.,0,Dresses
I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress it really is so pretty but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly the cut is not right for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection,0,Dresses
I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time)  and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0  and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly  no alterations need,1,Dresses

Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however  when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back  so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.,0,Dresses

I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo  so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person  the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate,1,Blouses
This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.,0,Sweaters

I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.,0,Knits
Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit,0,Dresses

I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,1,Knits

I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm.

I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,0,Knits

After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer!

Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,1,Dresses

The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it  and a slip dress underneath. this way  the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture  or left ope,1,Lounge

I bought this to wear to holiday parties  but it would work for any special occasion. the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background. the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge. i said it runs tts. i bought the size 2 and normally would wear a 2 or 4 in retailer dresses. the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips  so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type.. i did not have any issue with the armhole,1,Dresses

This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.,0,Sweaters

This top is so beautiful and well made  and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before  and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet  but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this  you won't regret it!,1,Blouses
Just received two  the red and the black. the black is a great print  very versatile. both run large  but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply.

I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.,0,Blouses
I'm usually a fan of maeve  but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy  and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose  it just droops in a most unfortunate way.,0,Dresses

"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner",1,Swim

This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition  the bow seemed to be too t,0,Blouses
This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.,0,Dresses
Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright  more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable  cute and easy to wear  a perfect dress for the fall/winter with,1,Dresses

This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,0,Skirts
I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.,0,Knits

I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,0,Pants
"I tried this cute black dress on in the store and even in the xs it was a little too big. i'm 5'3""  so if they had petites available in the store maybe they would have fit better. just found too much material around the middle even though it is meant to be a loose fitting dress. the material is heavy weight  very stretchy  but not a thick fabric. could be great in the summer.",1,Dresses
I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great  but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10  12  and 12 petite. the 10 actually fit  but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however  if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around  these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th,0,Pants
I love the fit  feel and quality but i didn't realize these are the new improved fabric denim weave that has almost no stretch.  i usually wear a 28 and i wish i had purchased the 29 or 30 to accommodate my weight fluctuations.  the great thing about this style is that i will not stretch out at the stress points unattractively.,1,Jeans
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe",0,Dresses
This dress was a disappointment. not black  but brown. and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly. on its way back...,0,Dresses
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,0,Knits
I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side  would have been ideal. love the navy  will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!,1,Dresses
"I'm 5'4""  32c and 125 lbs. i ordered the size 4p and while the color and fabric is pretty  the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps. it was also very tight across my ribs. despite ordering a petite  the hem was much too long. i ended up returning it.",0,Dresses
The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.,1,Knits
