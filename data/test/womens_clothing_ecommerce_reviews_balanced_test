I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!,1,Dresses
I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top  but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7  116 lbs  32a. it is very cute  but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly  could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining  simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return  try the size up  but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets  and would be a fun dress to wear f,1,Dresses
I tried on the xs petite  and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big  you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also  the material is soft but thin (see through  somewhat). the xs petite  just seemed big overall  i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs  30dd for reference.,0,Dresses
"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable.",0,Fine gauge
Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice  recommend hand wash!,1,Blouses
This is a very lovely t-shirt  because of the color and design. it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across. it's perfect for leaving it untucked. the petite fits really well  no too long or too short! my only complaint is the the material  while really soft is also quite thin so i'm not sure how durable it is.,1,Knits
"This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top.",0,Knits
I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great  if the fit works for you.,0,Knits
"I bought this tunic is blue. it is now one of my favorite tops to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings. i have always love rayon. this top did not disappoint me. it feels very soft and silky which makes it perfect for warmer days. for reference i am 5""1' 125 lbs  the xs p fits me just like the model...lose and not too long. i love it so much that i am considering another in different color.",1,Blouses
This is a gorgeous print  but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds  but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.,0,Blouses
It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine  but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.,0,Knits
I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length  too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.    rolls are not sewn on both ends  so you'll have to re-roll each wash.    wish you carried these basics at all times.,1,Pants
This is a great throw in your weekend bag summer dress. it runs a bit large  especially on the top  but i'll make it work. back is a bit low  so a cardigan would be required for office wear.,1,Dresses
I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.,0,Dresses
Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it  was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!,0,Knits
I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.,0,Pants
This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said  i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.,1,Knits
"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",0,Layering
"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin  and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides  i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived  i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick  the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus  the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4""  and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!",1,Dresses
This coat is beautifully tailored and made in the usa of 100% wool the color is vibrant. it looks great when you need a longer coat for the cold. it's almost an outfit on its own. lastly  the size was perfect. i ordered my normal 8 and it fit like a glove.,1,Outerwear
Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.,0,Knits
Great quality  beautiful print  definitely a steal given its current sale price. it does run large. order a size smaller. works perfect with a belt!,1,Dresses
I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.,0,Knits
I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.,1,Sweaters
The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,0,Fine gauge
Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit  so maybe i'll sew it up.,1,Skirts
Love this skirt length and the detail buttons. also great give to the jean fabric. looks great on and runs true to size.,1,Skirts
I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be,0,Blouses
Great colors  style and fit,1,Blouses
Buy this dress! you won't be disappointed. it's lovely and can be worn in the summer and easily transition to fall or even winter with opaque tights  tall boots  and a denim jacket. the neckline is unique and stunning - demure yet sexy - something that can easily be worn during the 9-5 work day or into the evening. i bought my regular size m and it hits just about my knees. i don't think this dress runs small at all.,1,Dresses
I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.,0,Blouses
I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy  something you can wear everyday.,1,Blouses
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.  this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store  salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.  i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte",1,Dresses
"The skirt is very pretty  but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference  i'm 5'7"" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price  i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times  then decide.",0,Skirts
I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and  although  i'm not a huge fan of gauze  the fit was perfect.  i had to  snatch it!,1,Pants

I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t,0,Blouses

This shirt style is boxy  however  the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear,1,Knits
I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...,0,Knits
This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting  but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.,1,Blouses
This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!,0,Dresses
"The material  deep color and design are gorgeous. however  the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p  and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.",0,Dresses
Like the other reviewers  i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body  so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets,1,Dresses
"I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red  and it's a beautiful  vibrant  festive color. i am small-busted  5'3"" and 120 lbs  and i got the regular xs  which fit very well  fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite  but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee  and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an",0,Dresses
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,0,Pants
I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size)  i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy. disappoin,0,Knits
Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution,0,Knits
I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year. so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day!,1,Sweaters
Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.,0,Blouses
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously  this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7"" frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl",1,Dresses
This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back,0,Trend

I wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.,0,Knits
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos  the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit  i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7""  128# with a very small",1,Blouses
"Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26"" (so it is at least 2"" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!",0,Skirts
I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one  it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer  and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.,0,Knits
Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.,0,Blouses
Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....,0,Knits
"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1  but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me  definitely a keeper!",1,Dresses
The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!,1,Knits
This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..,0,Dresses
I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!,0,Knits
So this shirt is very cute  i like the drape (if you can get it arranged properly)  but it is not black  more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy. i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet. i am keeping it  thinking i will wear it with leather  since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different. i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine. a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker.,1,Knits
I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store  it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long  covering my hands  and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that aren't related specifically to this sweater: even tho,1,Fine gauge
This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,0,Blouses
I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.,0,Knits
I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the,0,Dresses
This shirt is amazing. i bought it in white and found i was wearing it with everything...so i went back to get the gold (which is yellow). the dit runs big so order a size down. love the riffle around the sleeve and the little dot trim. very cute!,1,Knits
I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant  it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.,0,Dresses
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,0,Swim
"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length  the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size  always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an",1,Dresses

This dress is beautiful and so striking in it's unique design. i ordered a 4  as that is what i usually wear. about halfway up my body i knew it was not even going to zip! i did not even try. i love the fabric and colors so much though that i am going to try a 6. here's hoping it works!,1,Dresses

The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,0,Fine gauge
Like a baby doll top  with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears  i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.,0,Blouses
The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a,0,Dresses
I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.,0,Knits

Runs true to size  with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.,1,Outerwear
"Light weight and cotton  great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me  but they are not falling down so far. also  if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black  you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer.",1,Blouses

I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n,0,Blouses

This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can,0,Knits

With a skirt so vibrant  it's hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store  following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (i'm 5'4  slender build)  the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i don't necessarily mind a shorter length  but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep  but the quality of the material justifies it. the one,1,Skirts

I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a,0,Jeans

I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug,0,Pants
"Really like this top. fun flair  nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4""). will send petite back.",1,Blouses

This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.,0,Sweaters

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses

I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however  it didn't matter  because everything was itchy  and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design  and just like other reviewers commented  you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which  inevitably  will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning  there's no argument about that  and i welcome,1,Outerwear
I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful  breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline  upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i,0,Dresses
I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried,0,Dresses

The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch. i layer it with various camis for a different look each time. i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade  and goes well with so other many colors. looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect. classic yet unique! runs very true to size.,1,Fine gauge
Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.    i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black  you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.,1,Jeans

I tried this on today because when i touched it  it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange  it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace  but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said  it was very comfortable and soft,1,Dresses

I probably would have never purchased this blouse is i had only seen it online. but i was at our local store looking for something else and spotted it hanging all the way on the other end of the store. a salesperson encouraged me to try it on and it is beautiful! it can easily be dressed up or down. you can tie the bow in multiple ways or leave it hanging. it is sheer but the pattern obscures the transparency so no camisole is needed. it embraces the 70's vibe in a modern way. i absolutely love,1,Blouses
