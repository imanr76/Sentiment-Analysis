Yeah i know that sounds ridiculous. but this is really a nice piece  the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes. the color is perfect  a mid-deep indigo with just enough fading. i don't find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off  and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie. that said  it does run small. i'm usually a 6/28 and started off with a m. it was pretty form fitting  and the ct risk was at orange level. then the zipper wouldn't stay u,1,Pants
I love this top  the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned  but might if i wore it to work,1,Blouses
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.,0,Blouses
I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.,0,Dresses
I saw this top online and fell in love with it  as i live in white cotton comfy tanks  but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d  and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this,1,Lounge
I love this dress! i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering. i have worn it to several different occasions. it looks great with tights and boots and just flats. the lace detailing makes it unique.,1,Dresses
I originally ordered this blouse to wear for work. i was pleasantly surprised that i could wear it casually with jeans! fits comfortably and hugs my curves!,1,Blouses
Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!,0,Knits
"I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!",0,Shorts
I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend  but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!,0,Blouses
I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller  and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy  it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work  dinner  or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.,1,Knits
With a rather large chest  i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it's too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece,1,Knits
These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found!! people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand! flattering  comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out! highly recommend!,1,Jeans
The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,0,Jeans
I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.,0,Fine gauge
This shirt fits great. normally wear an xs or a small and a small fits in this. comfortable and cute on. i wish i had ordered the other color as well.,1,Knits
This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.,0,Skirts
Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink  a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large  depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas  it is,1,Fine gauge
I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful  but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode  or small chested  it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.,0,Dresses
I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray  not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.,0,Sweaters
I ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle. and it doesn't disappoint! it's cozy  lightweight but warm  flows well and looks great tied or worn loose. i ordered my regular size large in the grey. it fits as shown  just a bit longer because i'm short. the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed. it's really striking for such a casual piece. very pretty. highly recommend.,1,Fine gauge
I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great  comfortable  and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large  so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.,1,Knits
The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price  i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing  so i am debating whether i should keep or return.,0,Dresses
I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full,0,Skirts
I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.,1,Knits
I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc,0,Jeans
I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,0,Jeans
The colors on this sweater are cute  the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.,0,Fine gauge
"I am 5' 8""  145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore  i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however  the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore  i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j",0,Blouses
Fits great. structured  but still comfy. figure flattering.,1,Dresses
I didn't even notice this tee online  but in person in the store  i instantly loved it. then trying it on  loved it even more. it is flattering without being too tight. i got an xs  which is my usual size. i'm not a huge fan of the 3/4 sleeve length in winter  so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve  but no biggie  i still love!,1,Knits
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer,0,Skirts
Not sure who named this dress  but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric  with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes  leather flip flops  and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!,1,Dresses
The comfort of this fabric is terrific. the swing-y style is easy to wear. however  i expected a black and white dress  which is how it looked on line. in person  the light portion of the dress is a marled oatmeal color. it is fine - just not what i expected.  if you are a fan of swing dresses  this is a great  casual choice.,1,Dresses
I was in love with the green print  so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.,0,Dresses
The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.,0,Blouses
They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!,1,Pants
Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long  not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.,1,Pants
I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.,0,Knits
Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also  the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately  it has to go back.,0,Dresses
This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me  but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.  if they had additional colors  i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.,1,Blouses
"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2""  103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well  but instead of looking slouchy and cool  it just looked too big. so  back it goes.",0,Blouses
I love the skirt! the color is beautiful  but i didn't love the fabric. it's too delicate and not great for a mom with two busy boys.,1,Skirts
This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.,0,Sweaters
I love all jeans by mother  they are well made  fit great and look so cute with any type of shoes from heels  to flat to boots. these jeans are perfect to wear out or when paired with a blazer can be worn to work. i love these and have them in almost every color.,1,Jeans
I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it  but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon  because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.,0,Fine gauge
"I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it's just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5""3 and the dress isn't too long like most maxi's are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!",1,Dresses
I love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes...,0,Knits
This top is absolutely adorable  i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring  this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this  get it! you won't regret it.,1,Blouses
The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.,0,Knits
I love this top. i'm wearing it today. i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly. i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and i'm glad i did. it's still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well. nice fabric and well made. a great layering basic.,1,Layering
For the sale price  this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because  being on sale  that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders  and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later  i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers  but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true,1,Blouses
This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..,0,Dresses
Lovely dress  but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do.,1,Dresses
I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.,0,Knits
I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.,0,Dresses
Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,0,Layering
Really cute dress. i bought the white. i am usually a size 2 in retailer dresses but i could not even zip this! side zip was also slightly awkward. had to return  waiting for the 4.,1,Dresses
I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version  but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale.     i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.,0,Dresses
Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also  as has happened to me before  retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.,0,Dresses
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,0,Dresses
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,0,Pants
I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.,0,Skirts
I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings  jeans  or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!,1,Knits
I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s)  both hung horribly on me  they were just too big. i love a boxy  oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.,0,Knits
I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium  which was just ok. overall  the top half was comfortable and fit nicely  but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo  a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c,0,Dresses
Fits well through the shoulders and arms  but there is zero waist  and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute  but have to return because of that.,0,Blouses
A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places  no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size  you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.,1,Blouses
I was very impressed with the quality of the satin. this top can easily be dressed up or down. i purchased the white and love it! the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off. i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big.,1,Blouses
I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows  the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.,0,Knits
This wrap is awesome. soft material  perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!)  and warm  great for layering.,1,Lounge
I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front. i liked it  but sometimes items are different when you get them. this shirt was as pictured! the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think it's probably one of the nicer designs available. the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. also  some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here. t,1,Knits
This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.,0,Fine gauge
I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust  and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem  medium it is.,0,Outerwear
This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on,0,Knits
I love this top (so cute and comfy!)  but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing  especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......,0,Knits
I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!,0,Pants
I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it  paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.,1,Sweaters
Cute but too thick and rough,0,Sweaters
This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.,0,Dresses
"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust  order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.",0,Dresses
Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.,0,Dresses
The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it  cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress  it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back  i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!    wearing this to south beach  it will be perfect with strappy  high heels.,1,Lounge
The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.,0,Knits
Perfect summer/fall top. can also layer it. i wear it over a tank tunic and love it.,1,Blouses
"Another reviewer said it best  ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless.   with all the different reviews on size  i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5""  130  and have a small bust.",1,Dresses
I saw a lady trying this on in the store and fell in love with sweater. picture does not do it justice! there is so much detail. my usual size is small and it fit perfect. well worth price.,1,Sweaters
Soft  comfortable  stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.,1,Sweaters
I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same  boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.,0,Blouses
"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2  if not 0.     the bust is probably a 34 a or b  or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well  but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it  so i will return it.     the fabric  design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.",0,Swim
At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,0,Jackets
I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.,0,Skirts
I love this top  very slimming and cool fabric. only problem it is very delicate and will snag  as a mater of fact mine arrived with a hole in the back. i'm returning for exchange as i love the way the top looks  but know i will have to be super careful not to snag the fabric.,1,Knits

Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.,0,Knits
Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return  sadly.,0,Fine gauge
This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else  but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress  this will be a hard dress to wear.  the color is really lovely though!,0,Dresses
I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!,1,Blouses
This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.,0,Blouses
"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom  i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear.",1,Sweaters
This top is really pretty and flattering. i bought my usual size and its loose and flows without being too boxy. the pattern is beautiful and the band on the top stays up well.,1,Blouses

Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.,1,Sweaters
When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference  it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so  i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo,1,Dresses
Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.,0,Skirts

First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!,0,Dresses
I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...,1,Knits

I have many left of center tees  and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color)  which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long  the cotton is thick  and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me  though  because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me  though.,1,Knits

The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts,0,Blouses
This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.,0,Dresses

I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th,0,Dresses

The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,1,Knits

I thought the design of this dress was distinctive  and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on  but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive  there is something special about the dress.,1,Dresses
Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.,0,Lounge
While the dress is pretty  it's a lot more boring than it seems online. the box top is actually a completely separate piece  which is kind of neat - you can choose to remove it or not. the box top is very wide (much wider than on the model) and very unflattering! also  the dress is a stiff silk fabric and doesn't flow like you would think it would. returning it!,0,Dresses
I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.,0,Swim

I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!,0,Dresses
After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls  but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.,1,Swim

Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.,0,Dresses

I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going,0,Skirts

I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the,0,Dresses

I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,0,Shorts
Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.,0,Dresses

This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind  it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.,1,Dresses
Love  love this top. it is soft  comfortable  and cute. it is versatile (e.g. i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans). the tie at the neck adds a cute detail (if you want it tied). great staple for the wardrobe. i purchased in the black and it is very versatile  not sure how i feel about the print...,1,Knits
I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw,0,Dresses

I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale  i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of  i really do recommend it- well made  lovely colors  and nice style.,1,Dresses

I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.,0,Dresses
Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge    does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me    extra small is like a medium    not a sky color   like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath    better for taller larger sized people,0,Knits

These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.,0,Pants

I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.,0,Skirts

Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent,0,Swim

"This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top.",0,Knits
I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the,0,Blouses
Love the material -- it is a thick cotton  but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette.

This top light and airy  which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however  this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.,0,Blouses

This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,0,Blouses
Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego  i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on  but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible  i guess it's worth it!

I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,0,Dresses

This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.,0,Blouses
I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.,0,Dresses

I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available  so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white  like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress  but t,1,Dresses
I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.,1,Dresses
"For an athro top  this is a good price point  especially for such a beautiful piece. it's really just a basic tee  but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and it's much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- i'm normally a size small and got that size with this (34d  124 lbs.  5'4""  36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer  i really couldn't see my nude bra through it  so don't feel i'll need a cami  because that would ruin the delicate design of this.",1,Knits

This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.,1,Knits

This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.,0,Dresses
This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy  feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully  i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful,1,Fine gauge

I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2  then tried them on a few times  and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right  the larger one  hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.,1,Dresses

As other reviewers said  this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big  ordered a size down  & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally  i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra,1,Knits

I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia  where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool  out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!,1,Pants
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(,0,Dresses

I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.,0,Blouses

I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!,0,Knits

This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,0,Dresses

This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.,0,Dresses
This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted  almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly  not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.,0,Dresses
Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra  even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts  black pants  and skinny jeans,1,Blouses

I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!,0,Knits

This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression  wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done  pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long  so i will have to hem.,1,Dresses

This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.,0,Blouses

This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing  even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high  it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely  not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6,1,Dresses

Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said  the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes  i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly  but a 6 would have looked lumpy,1,Dresses

I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.,0,Blouses

Unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my,0,Dresses

Online this top looks fabulous  but in person  not so great. great color  nice quality for a lightweight top  but when i tried it on  the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found  for me  it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest  so didn't work. for reference  i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal,0,Knits
I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color)  but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however  in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me  this was not an issue  as the top suited my body type well rega,1,Knits
This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.,0,Sweaters
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,0,Dresses

I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters
This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!,0,Knits
Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,0,Blouses

The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.,0,Knits

I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.,1,Shorts
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,0,Sleep
I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,0,Shorts

I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully  a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin,1,Skirts
I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,0,Jackets
First  i absolutely love this dress  and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended  and the dress fits perfectly. however  when i zipped the dress up  the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly  so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.,0,Dresses

This dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here's what i don't like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow can't get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress.,1,Dresses

I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n,0,Dresses
This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style  but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up  so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.,1,Knits
I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool.   they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.,1,Trend
I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.,0,Jeans

I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan,0,Dresses
I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.,1,Dresses
That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.,0,Knits
The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......,0,Blouses

"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7""",0,Knits
The top of this dress is very flattering. there is a lot of fabric on the bottom half of dress. if you want something which hugs curves  this is not it. however  one of the things i like about this dress is  it can be dressed up or down. i wore to a wedding and got several compliments. very comfortable,1,Dresses
"Being that i am short  5'2""  this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5"". long leggy types could easily ""rock"" this.",0,Skirts

This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.,0,Dresses

I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy  sleeves way too long  etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line  you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.,0,Dresses

"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!",0,Jeans
I bought this in the sky color (and sized down from my normal medium) and absolutely love it. i don't think it's boxy at all. on the contrary  i love the way it hangs (i don't find it to be short either  though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath). p.s. the ruffle detail is precious!,1,Knits
Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!,1,Blouses

I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however  when i tried it on  i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck  arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy  although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me  but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so  it may be best to wear a cami,1,Dresses

Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes  but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on  it was big under the arms and waist area  i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect.,1,Blouses

The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.,1,Knits

How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,1,Dresses

On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.,0,Dresses
Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!,0,Dresses
I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good  though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.     i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia,1,Sweaters

It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.,1,Blouses

I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.,0,Trend
The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.,0,Dresses

Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle  such a bummer  sleeves are much longer  and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger  in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it  but consider the mentioned if buying.,0,Blouses

This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.,0,Knits

These pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color. like others have said they fit almost like high-waisted leggings  which i for one love. it makes them really comfortable while the nice  heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office. i do find that the pockets are pretty useless  as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers. the zipper is a bit pokey as well.,1,Pants

Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!,0,Dresses

The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge

I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded,0,Knits

I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe  but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately  i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long  so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't,0,Knits

I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however  some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also  it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture  it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as,0,Sweaters

I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,0,Skirts
As with most retailer tops  this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice  pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.,0,Sweaters

I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color  but the fit was huge  no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose  but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color  but the execution left much to be desired.,0,Dresses

Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.,0,Lounge

They fit snug and accentuate all the right curves. they could be shorter. the lace up sides are interesting  but i might sacrifice the lace ups for making them shorter. actually they are cuter on in person than in this photo.,1,Jeans
I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.,1,Knits
I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.,0,Jeans

This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.,0,Dresses

Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,0,Fine gauge

I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.,0,Blouses
This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?,0,Dresses

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late  this brand has really fallen all over the board for me  but this top had the right fabric  fit  and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!,1,Blouses
The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom  like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.,1,Fine gauge
A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.,0,Jackets
I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.,0,Knits

Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it  and know it will work well for both the office  church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes  and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great  even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall  i'm satisfied with my purchase!,1,Dresses

Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses

Love this top! the fit is so comfortable  and it flows beautifully when you walk. the added bonus is the flirty open back  cross strap design to make even your exit an attention grabber. pairs great with some jean leggings and wedge heels.   loved it so much i went back and ordered another color.,1,Knits

This vest is so functional. i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo. it has a much softer look to it and is less orange  more tan. i've worn it with a lot of different things: over a sweater dress at work  with soft pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt  or skinny jeans/pants and a simple top. wish it came in other colors (gray  navy or green would all be amazing)...one of my favorite pieces this season for sure. i do think it runs a little bit large  but i think the next size smaller,1,Sweaters

I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,0,Swim

I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses

I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces  and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.,0,Outerwear
"I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6"" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone  which suits me just fine. they are",1,Jeans

The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture  plain black. the back print is nice just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.,0,Knits
I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.,0,Outerwear
On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.,0,Dresses

This sweater is ok. i love  love  love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring  but once it arrived  i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also  it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on,0,Sweaters
I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!,0,Knits
I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these  however  is high quality and weighty  wearable in fall  but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red  dark pink  and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!,1,Pants

I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.,0,Dresses

Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,0,Skirts

Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!,1,Sweaters
This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.,0,Dresses

The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,0,Dresses

I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping,0,Shorts
I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first  it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in  throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional  wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece,1,Dresses

I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.,1,Blouses

I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,0,Dresses
Ordered the navy and aqua in medium. the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy. loved the color on both but returning the the aqua. normally wear size 6,1,Swim
I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,0,Layering
Love this. the stripes are cute and simple  but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank  so there is a lot of fabric  but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :),1,Knits

Ok. love this top. i'm 5'4 106 34b and the 0 reg fits perfect on the top half. i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top. it is very short. i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough. i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige. great with jeans or navy for work.,1,Blouses
I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale  and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up  the arms do run a little tight. overall  the mock neck  button closure on the back  and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look,1,Blouses

This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top  like a dolman sleeve  but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top  which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri,0,Knits

This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.,1,Fine gauge

Just got this top in the mail today  and i love it. i bought the white in a small  and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton  but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined  so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large  as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer  and a lot of summers,1,Blouses

The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,0,Intimates

Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca,0,Knits

These weren't what i expected  but i kind of really like them. they have a very high rise  and so they end up being high waisted. the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable. however  the fabric is very stretchy  and i'm not sure i can wear them to work. but they're a little fancy for the weekend. the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black. all things i can work with  but they are a little different than i imagined. they are quite long -- i'm 5'8 and will likely have to,0,Pants
I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!,1,Dresses
Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.,0,Dresses
Cute shorts with great fabric (and lined so they lay smooth over your body). i really love that the material has a dressier feel  but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me (curvy body  5'7''  150). i'm returning them and trying a small. elastic waist is great for me after having a baby  but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt.,1,Shorts
Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,0,Fine gauge
I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me  it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great ,1,Knits
This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,0,Intimates

My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white  yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft  it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts  jeans and leggings.,1,Knits
"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities  for me  ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4"" and 125  hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.",0,Dresses
"I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line ""princess"" seams in the front and back  but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.",0,Skirts
I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.,0,Dresses
I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers  a light blue tank  off white shirt  tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.,1,Jackets

This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.,1,Skirts

The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice! the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person! it is very well made  having no loose threads whatsoever. the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with. it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too. i took my usual size large. i would say that if you're betwe,1,Jackets
This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi,0,Sweaters
I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft  105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed  i really wanted this top to work.,0,Knits
Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms  the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.,0,Fine gauge
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!,0,Knits

Darling top  lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa,1,Blouses

I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!,0,Blouses

I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.,0,Jeans
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.,0,Sweaters
This dress is beautiful in person  the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses  but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room  but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part  it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we,0,Dresses
I think the description and image might be slightly misleading and is giving this dress a bad name...it's not a drop waist dress as indicated in the description. it's a swingy a line silhouette- more fitted in the bodice and swingy as it its bells at the hem- which i find flattering. another discrepancy is that the brand is hd in paris  not glamorous. however i happened to find an online return at my local store and liked the print so i tried it on and fell in love with the 60s retro vibe and pr,1,Dresses

I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on,0,Knits

I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.,0,Dresses
This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,0,Layering
