This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd  and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much  i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in  unlike most pencil dresses  and i cannot say enough about the color. wow  heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de,1,Dresses
I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great  so soft & comfy  but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me  it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top  but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model  this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.,0,Knits
This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does  it feels soft on the skin  light-weight  and has a nice bounce to it. it's,1,Blouses
I am a 36dd  10/12 in tops and 12/14 in bottoms.  i tried both the navy/red pattern and the green polka dot. color and patterns on both are gorgeous. the fabric is very comfortable and a nice fit on the bottom half. size large fit perfectly in the waist however i had gapping across the bust. size xlarge fit ok in the front of the bust  but was loose in the back  gapping at the neck  and the waist was very loose. cute and comfy but only recommended for smaller busted gals.,0,Dresses
Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress  but as others have said  the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me  i found other dresses that i loved more  this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.,1,Dresses
I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted  so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.,0,Dresses
This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.,1,Dresses
I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!,1,Knits
It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???,0,Blouses
I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.,0,Pants
This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.,1,Dresses
Great material  and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up  making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.,1,Layering
I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style  the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.,1,Fine gauge
Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels  multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine  funky  and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!,1,Skirts
This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.,0,Lounge
"This dress has a nice soft fabric and pretty details in the stitching and there is a matching slip with adjustable straps that snaps onto the inside shoulders. i found the length in petite to be fine but the loose fit to be unflattering for me as a short person (5'1""). however  the photos here on the website with the model are quite accurate- you can see exactly how it fits loose through the waist. if that's what you are looking for  go for it  but personally i didn't find it to ""do anything"" fo",1,Dresses
It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.,0,Knits
This is a really cute skirt  and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also  the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to,1,Skirts
I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!,1,Outerwear
I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.,0,Fine gauge
I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.,0,Knits
I absolutely love this suit and was very disappointed to have to return it! it is really well made and the fabric colors/design is beautiful in person. unfortunately it just did not fit my body type. i am athletic build with a smaller chest and thicker behind  120lbs  5'4. the small was definitely the right size for me  but the back of the suit cut way high up on the butt so that a lot of the rear is exposed  which just did not work well for me. this will work great for someone with a smaller bu,1,Swim
This is so much better than wearing a grey sweatshirt. i love it and it makes me feel pretty.,1,Knits
Like another reviewer  i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large  and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric  and his is he perfect length for leggings.,1,Knits
"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large  but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style  it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly  plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",1,Sweaters
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.,0,Lounge
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.,0,Dresses
These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist  which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared  long leg! very long  in fact. i'm 5'5  130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work  with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out  i'd order another pair - they are,1,Jeans
I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say,0,Dresses
I like the idea of a skort  and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!,1,Shorts
This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.,0,Dresses
This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute  but better suited for someone smaller chested.,0,Knits
Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.  the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-small  and it fits beautifully. plus  the weight of the knit is just right for  chilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!,1,Fine gauge
I love the design of this tunic. it is sewn well  but the fabric is cheap. i disliked the texture of the fabric so much that i returned it.,0,Knits
"I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick  it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews  i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch  and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic  i was not surprised by the ""brightness"" of it like othe",1,Dresses

These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium  but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.,1,Lounge
"I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this ""cardigan"" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short  i'm only 5 5"" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down  i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also  one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but",1,Sweaters

I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.,0,Blouses
The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.,0,Dresses
"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail  but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso  and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!  curvy ladies  also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely  the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not  and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would",0,Dresses
Love the color of this dress  however found it a little boxy  and the arms are too tight. i ordered up a size ( m) which is probably why it is boxy and i can hardly get it over my arm  i am very athletic. probably should have sent it back.,1,Dresses
I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7  flat chested  135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer  because i do not consider myself tall.,0,Sweaters
Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,1,Sweaters
The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy  too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.,0,Blouses
I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a,0,Trend
"Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5"" 36c 126lbs",0,Knits

This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.,0,Knits
"This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because  despite how much i liked the style  it just wasn't flattering on my body type.",0,Swim
This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute,0,Blouses
Lovely color and fits nicely. only problem on mine  the front stitches were not properly sewn.,1,Knits
I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.,0,Dresses
I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!,0,Dresses
This top has a lot of potential (comfortable  easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small  medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model  too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.   i tried the green in the sto,0,Knits
This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual  its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little  more edge and character. fit is slightly large. i'm 5'5''  125 lbs and purchased the small. the arms are a little longer than i'd like and the overall fit is slightly too loose. however  it's not a significant enough problem for me to return the shirt.,1,Knits
Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size 4 regular  or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p  but it's no longer available.,1,Dresses
I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.,0,Dresses
I drooled over this dress online  so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person  & the drape of the skirt (good quality  fully lines)  i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight  ill-fitting  & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size. it's a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable!,0,Dresses
"I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6""  petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy.",0,Lounge
This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.,1,Blouses

After promising myself never to buy another a-line skirt that makes me look shorter  i caved in because this one is so cute. the material is soft but holds its shape. you do have to have a long narrow waist line to pull this one off and size up one as i'm usually a 2  but took a 4 in this beauty. vintage perfection. pair with turtleneck or form fitting sweater or tee and clogs or heeled tall boots. it's a must!,1,Skirts
It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish  well made  and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival  remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.,1,Skirts
I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.,1,Shorts
I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.,0,Sweaters
I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but  it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully  unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut  make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but  for wearing at home in the summer  they're worth having. the m,0,Knits

I had to order this dress three times to get the correct size. ordered a petite which worked great. i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best. love the color! perfect for so many occasions  church  special events and dinner out. great with flats and wedges. i know i will be wearing it lots this summer. did i mention i love the color! worth repeating.,1,Dresses

Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,0,Dresses

The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,0,Swim

A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,0,Fine gauge
First  let me say i really like these pants before i get into what's wrong with them. the fabric is a nice weight and drapes really pretty. they are very long for you leggy girls out there or ladies who like to wear platform shoes and that's a plus for me.  now for the issues: the waist runs small  but not so much that i can't wear them. they are roomy and comfy otherwise  just snug there. the hem came out of mine  so that's the big bummer here. i have to hem them  which is a chore and i wish th,1,Pants
Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to,0,Dresses
These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j,0,Pants

I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses

Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey  but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at,1,Knits

"This dress is really beautiful  cheerful  the color lovely  the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style  fabric  and color. i am 5' 5"" with long legs and a shorter upper body  so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size  but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely",1,Dresses
"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4""  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.",0,Trend

This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp,0,Dresses
This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down  with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4 124 lbs  broad shoulders  with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer  a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.,1,Blouses
Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,1,Skirts
I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever. i wear it with a tank top underneath so i haven't noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned.   i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear it.  i wish i had it in the blue color too!,1,Knits
I love these jeans. at first  i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!,1,Jeans

These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.  i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.  the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.  love the braided styling around the pockets.  the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.,1,Jeans

I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.,0,Lounge
I love the cut of this dress  and i'm rather short. i don't think you need to be tall. it's a nice  light fabric that will work well for warm weather. it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day  but never looked messy. i certainly wouldn't describe it as frumpy. it has a nice  loose  1920s feel  and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist. the belt is sewn on in the back  so you can't take it off without quite a bit of tailoring. i had no trouble with the bust being too,1,Dresses
I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size. thanks antro!,1,Knits

I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.,0,Pants

This dress is pretty  but there were a few things i disliked.    the overdress is fairly shapeless; however  the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer  the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress  the slip  and the lace. finally  as other reviewers have shared  the buttons are not functional  and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.     i recommend trying the dress,0,Dresses

Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath  but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad  just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic  but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms  but apparently i don't.,0,Knits
Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large.  so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look  order down a size.,1,Sleep
This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.,0,Dresses
I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.,0,Dresses

I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.,0,Sleep

When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.,0,Dresses

The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment  and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes  and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the,1,Swim

This is super cute. i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and it's quite roomy. i probably could have sized down to an xs  but i like the relaxed look. there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise it's a beautiful and unique top.,1,Knits
I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.,0,Sweaters
"This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said ""wow that's very elegant"". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality",0,Sweaters

L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place  but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.,0,Swim
Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on  but can be worn in a versatile way  and if you are small chested  without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material  i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!,0,Dresses
This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress. it's really comfortable  true to size and the cut is flattering. you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals. i didn't want to take it off. sizing is straightforward on this one: just order your regular size. there's nothing tricky about sizing. the xxsp (my regular size  depicted here)  was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description. great buy. waiting for boston weather to coope,1,Dresses

"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4  weigh around 120 lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.",0,Skirts
"I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape  and is very comfortable. however  it's plain  and for the price and it being dry clean only  i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2"" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite  but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).",0,Dresses

I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!,0,Knits
I'm very happy with this sweater--it's very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch. the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily. by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy.,1,Sweaters
"I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and i'm very pleased. they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms  the stripes remain a bit looser throughout. no complaints here! i like the variation. i ordered a size small as i'm normally a size small (36c  135 lbs  5'2"").",1,Blouses
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,0,Dresses
I don't understand the low rating. the head opening in my size (2) is perfect and i don't have a small head.   the style is both flattering on many shapes and very comfortable. the embroidery is gorgeous and the blue hue can be paired with many colors. it be worn with jeans on the weekend and also dresses up beautifully for the office if worn with a jacket and a pair of slacks. i wore it with an olive jacket and jeans last week and received compliments!   the caveat is that it wrinkles.. a lot.,1,Blouses

This is a nice light top for the summer. i love how your shoulders peak out from tee  which gives it a touch of of sexiness. it does run large so i went down a size. i haven't washed it yet so don't know if it will shrink. i do recommend it though.,1,Knits
The material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well.  when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out. it made me look much bigger than i am.  i ordered a large (normally i wear lg or xl) and it's possible a medium would have fit better. unfortunately this shirt had to be returned.,0,Knits
I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.,0,Sweaters
I'm short and curvy and just had a baby. love this cape because it's super comfy and warm but not too warm. have had it for a couple of weeks now and it's my go to for running around during the day. the description says grey but it reads a tiny bit green - like light camo green but so slight that it still pairs well with most everything.     usu a med but got the xs/s because of how slouchy it is anyway. med looked too big in the shoulders.,1,Jackets

Every single time i was in a store  this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however  so when a free shipping offer came up  i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better  but a little snug  so if it shrunk  i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one  it would have been the large; however  they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger  but on a body  it is,0,Dresses

I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length  but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless  billowy and wide  which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment  by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward  but i decided to return the dress.,0,Dresses
Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.,0,Knits

I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.,0,Knits

I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however  i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it  the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch  but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it  so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this  i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.,0,Dresses

I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size. however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.,0,Knits
I purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print. the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual.,1,Dresses
This skirt is much more vivid in person  which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up  however  i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.,1,Skirts
I love the lacey design of this top. however  it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better  but this size was too short. in addition  the lace didn't lay very flat  and there were lose threads all over. overall  not worth the price.,0,Blouses
These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.,0,Pants
I got this sweater in the neutral color  which is very versatile. it is truly  beautifully soft and the design is very pretty -- i really like the different material of the arms and v-neck. the length is good  too  if you like longer sweaters  as i do. the downside: it sheds so badly! sweater is just everywhere after putting it on. i don't think i could wear it out of the house for this reason. another reviewer suggested taking a tape roller to it to make it wearable  but i think that would take,1,Fine gauge

The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.,1,Layering

"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust  5'5""  around 116 lbs)  but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on",0,Knits

It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,0,Skirts
This top is very pretty and looks so good with the blue flower skirt. unfortunately it runs very small. it fit my bust but would not go down. i imagine it would look better on a much slender frame  but since it fit my bust i wonder if the armholes are too big or it maybe a bit loose at the top. i like the style and design a lot  very dressy  but the buttons at the top are a bit hard to put on and remove. since this is turtleneck  every time you wear it the buttons have to come on and off. the bu,1,Blouses

As others have mentioned  the proportions of this coat are a bit strange  but i do like the oversized feel  and the low button. it is really soft and i like the beige lining  too. there's room for a sweater under it  so layered it is probably warm enough for temperatures in the high thirties and warmer. what makes me a little crazy about it--i almost returned it because of this--is that the stripes don't match up on the seams. they are slightly off and i think the coat cost enough that a mistake,1,Outerwear

I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.,0,Dresses

I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p,0,Dresses

Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,0,Jackets

This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.,0,Knits

I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.,0,Pants

The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.,0,Knits

I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes  00p and 0p  depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes  i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far  so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area  i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re. the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor,1,Dresses

I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0,Dresses

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses

I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.,0,Blouses

I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!,0,Knits

I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it  it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy,1,Dresses

I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.,0,Jackets
Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin  which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.,0,Jeans

These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160  which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length  and the size 32 was bigger than i need  but not too big. these are very classy looking  and go with sandals to booties for every type of look  summer to winter   with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.    the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;,1,Jeans

I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters

Fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores. whimsical but work--appropriate. i'm typically a 4 in dresses. i would say this skirt runs tts; however  the front pleats will create a pouch-y stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anything-below-your-waist. size up one size to avoid this. the waist size will be loose  but it will allow the pleats to lay flat. absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top. also great with solid white  black  or printed blouses. not a true pen,1,Skirts

When you order online  you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers  i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral  cream  green  and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however  i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes  order down.,1,Blouses

This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit  length  and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter  but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :),1,Fine gauge
What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.,0,Skirts
This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton  but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to,1,Trend

I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme,0,Dresses
I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips  butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5  135 lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.,0,Dresses
The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.,1,Skirts
This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however  it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame  because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.,0,Sweaters

I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly  the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.,1,Fine gauge

I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would,0,Blouses
The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.,0,Dresses

This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn't get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this,1,Jackets

The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping,0,Knits

The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.,0,Pants
I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender  but hey  im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats  sofa  etc. i made the mistake of not washing first  but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.,1,Pants

I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,0,Jackets
Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front  but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft  but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look  but sadly this is going back.,0,Blouses

This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,0,Dresses

I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.,0,Blouses

Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,1,Fine gauge

Unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my,0,Dresses
I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it's slightly loose in the body of the dress  that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it's rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i didn't experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together  and the zipper was stiff so it won't unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w,1,Dresses
This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will.

Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it's a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it's lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there's the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it's lined. although it's so cropped  i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that's longer.,1,Outerwear

I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.,0,Swim

First of all  the colors are really pretty  fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested  this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid  it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.,0,Dresses

This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.,0,Blouses

First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,0,Fine gauge

Beautiful in white  and beautiful to look at  but as the other reviewer mentioned  the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however  the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition  some of the beading is already coming off  and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad  but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful,1,Blouses

If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses

I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings  with boots  etc.  this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.  the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).  even if i could find a size that worked  there was n,0,Knits

Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also  i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large)  but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows  i would size up. i love the unique design!,1,Blouses

Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length  too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering  particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person  way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.,0,Knits

I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,0,Jackets

After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,0,Blouses

Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering  with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person  the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute  i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.,1,Pants
I saw this dress in the store tried it on and   love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14)  plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun,1,Dresses

This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.,1,Dresses
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0,Knits
I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right  it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point  but with the 25% of full p,1,Dresses

I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.,0,Skirts
If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of,0,Skirts
I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!,0,Dresses
I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t,0,Dresses

I love this brand  i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap  reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin  and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath  you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black  and am keeping it only because i love the design  need a black top desperat,0,Knits

So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!,1,Knits

I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short  nice v neck (but not deep)  pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no 'glide' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also  it's a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an 'easy' and not tight/form fitting dress  but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section,1,Dresses

The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist  it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted  so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c  140b and got the small. fits great.,1,Knits
The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.,0,Knits

I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.,0,Knits

On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.,0,Dresses

I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace  in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami  which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it  my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made ,1,Blouses

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses

This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me  slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well  especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect  to my knees.,1,Skirts
It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec,0,Dresses

I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice  thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom  just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end  which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs  and the xs was not even,0,Knits

I do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it. very soft  good length  and comfortable to wear. the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering. the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production. for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top. it is not a sheer fabric. try it on if you see it in the store.,1,Knits

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses

I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.,1,Dresses

I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,0,Dresses

I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on,0,Knits
"Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3"" so it works well",1,Skirts
I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants  and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.,0,Pants

I wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful  but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.,0,Blouses

The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.,0,Knits

"Couldn't make it work  even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan  like dirty vintage.

I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.,0,Outerwear
"This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference  i'm 5'6""  120 lbs  34c  and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted  and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.",1,Dresses

I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,0,Blouses

This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,0,Skirts
It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the,0,Dresses

I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,0,Blouses

This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans  linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too.   i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft  but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall  thin  without much figure. it's not cheap  but something i'll likely keep for a few years.,1,Blouses

"I wanted to love this dress so much  but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer  and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide  much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite)  and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture  but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",0,Dresses
It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible ,0,Dresses
After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online  so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality  but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12  but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge  arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately  unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing ,1,Dresses

It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while  i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.,1,Fine gauge
This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,0,Dresses

I bought this dress with my birthday coupon  i love the design of the fabric  and i think the length is great. it's a lightweight dress  which makes it a nice for more seasons. sandals in the summer  light sweater in the spring/fall  and tights  slip  and heavy sweater in the winter. the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it  which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater. the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all. very satisfied!,1,Dresses
"Being that i am short  5'2""  this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5"". long leggy types could easily ""rock"" this.",0,Skirts

These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for  and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim  but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse  but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.,1,Pants

This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.,0,Blouses
I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!,0,Outerwear
Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.,0,Dresses

I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it  making it even harder to get off. it was returned.,0,Swim

Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0,0,Blouses

I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person. so happy i did! i never would have picked it up in the store. it looks much better on than on the hanger. it is so flattering! you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt  it somehow makes you look slim! wow! i took my usual medium. highly recommend!,1,Knits

Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.,0,Fine gauge

I really love this piece because it's classic and the style transitions from day-to-night. the color caught my eye first  but once i tried it on  it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me. i felt too comfortable to be stylish  but there i was multi-tasking my full-time passions in the retailer dressing room. no big deal.     i am a tall  size 4/6 woman. for taller girls like me who a) intend to wear a small heel with the piece,1,Pants

I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,0,Skirts
This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it  which is awesome  and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also  the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.,0,Dresses
Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.,0,Blouses

This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.,0,Fine gauge
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0,Intimates
I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back  thin  silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .,0,Dresses

In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l  which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all  a great purchase.,1,Knits

Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.,0,Sweaters
Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.,0,Dresses

Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price  i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms  but they are good enough.,1,Knits
The model makes this dress look amazing  but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful  i loved that  but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full  not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but  sadly  it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you  but few others.,0,Dresses

Haha  the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline  i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which  with my full bust underneath it  refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.,1,Fine gauge

Great fit in waist  hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.  i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.,1,Jeans

I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,1,Blouses

I love how this sweater fits. i was reluctant to get it because i thought it would be boxy  but it's a perfect length  especially for a higher waisted pants or jeans. the fabric is super soft. i only gave it four stars because i thought it was going to be grey  but it's more like a marled black/white  80s-style color.,1,Sweaters
This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem,1,Sweaters

Can't say how much i love this top - ordered on a whim and when it arrived i was so pleasantly surprised. the sweatshirt fabric is thick  the under layers are high quality sheers. super easy to dress up or down - i wore it to a (casual) company holiday party and got tons of compliments. bonus that i just had a baby and the top seemed to hide my not-quite-prepregnancy body  but will also look great when i am back in shape. a definite keeper!,1,Knits

I'm glad i saw this item in stores  otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp  and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable  and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!,1,Dresses

I bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with  so they may sag.  overall  i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren,0,Dresses
I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day,0,Sweaters

I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.,0,Jackets

Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.,0,Dresses

I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.   other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.,1,Blouses

I wanted something for the hot summers here  and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design  short in the front  hitting an inch or two above the knee  but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward  and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin  and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers  it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight  but not the greatest quality,0,Dresses

I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on  i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress  there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.,1,Dresses

First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.,0,Jackets
Picked this up in the store today  but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo  but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing  but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l,0,Sweaters
I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.,0,Blouses
I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap,0,Skirts
I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.,0,Jackets

Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.,0,Pants
"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels  white tee  and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh  and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these  please!",1,Pants
This top! it is so simple  but so great at the same time! it does run large  and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft  washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual  but so comfy. it's great for loungin,1,Knits

This is a gorgeous sweater but huge. and when i say huge  i mean gigantic. i'm usually a size large and i don't even think the small would be small enough. the cowl neck and fabric overall is great (although stretches out  which is why it becomes so overwhelming) but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket. the armholes are very big - deceiving on the model. returning.,1,Sweaters

I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap,0,Dresses
I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut  but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole,0,Dresses

I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.,1,Pants
"Cute print on both sides  but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.",0,Swim
I'm 5'8  130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric  pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.,1,Pants

This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown. unfortunately  when i tried it on  it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to. i also didn't care much for the waist ties on the side. an elastic waist might have been better.,0,Dresses
I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!,0,Blouses
I usually wear a small  sometimes and extra small  so when i ordered this skirt in a small  i wasn't worried. when it arrived  there is no stretch whatsoever and i'd have to wear it really it high in order to zip it. not necessarily a bad look but it is a little uncomfortable (no give  stiff material). it is really pretty  bright color and the eyelets and slit are unique. might try the next size up.,1,Skirts

"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green",0,Knits

Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.,0,Jeans

Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric  and has perfect fit  nice arm length  looks good on the hanger  the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded  in the mail  so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket  tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put,0,Knits

Very well made and would flatter the right body type. i sized up to a medium (normally size 6)  but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me. the only thing you could see was the grey liner. i'm not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly  or it ran terribly small. i have had success with bailey 44 in the past so maybe this one was just not for me. the quality of the fabric and design are well done.,1,Dresses
Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others  i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.,1,Dresses
The fabric has a beautiful drape; the skirt is a nice length  and it blows  moves  and swings in a most flattering way. the gray is a an elegant color  and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events. the top  however  sags  and overwhelms the more fitted lining. too bad!,0,Dresses
"This dress is so flattering on  i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high  even though i'm only 5'1"" tall  but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice  but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work  or church  but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend",1,Dresses

I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium  but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue  because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but  if that doesn't solve the trick  if not recommend  b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.,1,Knits
This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.,0,Sweaters
I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.,0,Blouses

The colors and textures on this top are fun. however  the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.,1,Knits

I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit  because,0,Dresses

In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.,1,Fine gauge

This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately  i caught the cutouts a few times  and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable  but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan  this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s,1,Knits

This is the 4th pair of ag stevie jeans i have bought from retailer. the petite sizing fit me great (i'm 5'1 and 112 lbs) the quality is fabulous and worth the price. i have 2 denim  1 white  and just purchased these dark wave. i went to the ag store and they do not carry petities. this jean is made exclusively for retailer. love them!,1,Jeans
I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.,0,Knits
This ia very pretty dress. however  it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress  but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft  does wrinkle easily  but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown  but i really love this dress!,1,Dresses
This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on,0,Knits
I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t,0,Lounge

This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t,0,Dresses

The shirt is exactly as it is pictured  i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size  as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.,1,Blouses

I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine  but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different  but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.,0,Trend

Ordered these pants in an xs (5'5  110lbs) -- they fit well in the waist  but are quite long so i roll the waist band down once. they are super fun & funky - i mainly plan to wear them around my house so i don't mind rolling the waist band. if i were going to wear them out  i'd probably have to pair with heels as they are a few inches too long. light & airy material perfect for summer  & cute detail on the pocket seams too.,1,Pants
The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.,0,Knits

This skirt is flattering and so soft. i've worn it once  and while it did keep feeling like a scandalous slit  i just had to keep reminding myself of the awesome inner skirt. i gave a 4 instead of 5 because my elastic seems to roll ever so slightly in front so that the pleats don't hang flat  and also a little bit of stitching on the outside was loose. since it's nothing that will unravel the whole thing  i'm not too worried about it.,1,Skirts
These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size  which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair  but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now  that said  i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants  and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t,0,Pants

This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring  as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless  sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect  just wish retailer has more offerings like this.,1,Sweaters
I love this sweater!! love the length  it's a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear  but looks great with boots and leggings. love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back  the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric. all combine to make a great sweater. runs true to size  has a loose fit but you don't feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans.,1,Knits

Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.,0,Dresses

This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!,0,Knits
I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!,0,Skirts
The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric,0,Knits
Fit tts  very flattering and slimming with fitted thighs and slight flare. can be dressed up given the beautiful and classy dark wash. the hint of stretch makes them super comfortable. the only thing is  they are very long  will have to hem unless you are 6 ft tall. in my 5'5 case i'm afraid the hemming will take away some of the flare effect. ag  please make pants with realistic length! still  very happy  especially since i was lucky to get my size during a promo.,1,Jeans

I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,0,Knits

The shirt is quite beautiful  the lace is thick and high quality. however  i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person  or one who has a straighter build.,0,Knits

Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model  it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it  but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.,1,Fine gauge

This is a really adorable top!normally i shop online  but ended up in a store today. i bought it instantly  but never would have purchased this based upon the pictures. as all the other reviewers have said  this does run small and you need to size up  especially if you are busty for your size. i am a 4 or a small  (34c) in just about everything  but had to go to a medium. the sleeves attach too far out on the front of the top  restricting arm movement. thankfully  i didn't see a significant size,1,Blouses

I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back  i went with a medium  but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well  so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back  but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li,0,Sweaters

Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.,1,Dresses

This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.  other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.,0,Dresses

I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.,0,Dresses

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.,0,Dresses
This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern  and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.,1,Knits
I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.,0,Knits

No need to be on the fence about this top  it's lovely! what you see pictured here  is exactly what you get  even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16  apple shape  40 c bust  and this xl does not cling at all to me  so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering  and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!,1,Knits
I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!,0,Knits

This dress is gorgeous in person  soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe  but well worth it.,1,Dresses

Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.,0,Blouses

Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.,0,Sweaters

A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i,0,Dresses
First  i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic  but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and,1,Sweaters

I went to the store specifically to try this dress on  because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit. it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life  but unfortunately i couldn't fill out the top. there was gaping even when i went down to a size 0  even though i mostly wear a 4 and sometimes a 2 in retailer dresses. (the 0 fit me everywhere else  which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra  or for someone with more cup size?,1,Dresses

I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.,0,Dresses

These are very well-made jeans  the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist  and they make my butt look great. however  these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing  but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy  then buy your regular size.,0,Jeans

I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life,0,Sleep

I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy,0,Knits
I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,0,Jeans

The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,0,Jeans

Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines,0,Sweaters

I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller  and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy  it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work  dinner  or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.,1,Knits
The lace front is more detailed than i expected  but in a good way. the sleeves are softer on the outside  but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said  in my opinion. it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where i'm sitting when wearing it. not a deal breaker though...,1,Knits

I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.,0,Dresses
The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,0,Swim
I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.,1,Blouses

Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,0,Skirts

I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!,0,Blouses
5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice  the green color is dark and rich  it has a hood. however  the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement  and the bust and hips were cut too tight  overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one  it has a much fuller sweep  so the proportions still seem right. also,0,Sweaters

The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices  i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it  the cotton just doesn't lay right.,0,Knits
This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.,0,Jackets
"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted ",0,Dresses
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.,0,Dresses
When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,0,Shorts

"This shirt is adorable.  but...it didn't work for me!  i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4""  34g). i tried on the small  since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight  yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much  making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back  and i would have been in love.  love the blue color!",0,Knits
"I love this dress  it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person  5'4"" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me  but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.",1,Dresses

Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same  the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length  however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip)  but the overlay comes down way past my,0,Dresses

I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live,0,Jeans

I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!,1,Dresses
This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses
"I've been scouting retailer's store  looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.  this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe  but a fun addition. i love the fact that there's extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller  therefore no need for a cami underneath.  i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large  5'4""  34g).",1,Knits

This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control!,0,Blouses
I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture  which makes it more interesting.,1,Blouses

Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.,0,Blouses

I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot,0,Dresses

As a busty but small-waisted girl  i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however  it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable  and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact  it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.,1,Dresses
Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it  was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!,0,Knits

Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses
I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0,Dresses

I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high  but with a tank underneath  it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest  flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top  so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones  it's still a beautiful blouse ,1,Blouses

I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,0,Jackets
I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.,0,Dresses

"I thought this dress was worth reviewing since my opinion differs from many others. i agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses  but the flattering fit and quality (has a nice built in slip) i found to be what you may expect from the brand. if you go in thinking it's more of a spring/summer dress  you will not be disappointed. however  i find the sizing to be slightly off. i usually wear a 2p (i'm 5'2"")  or a 0 regular. i ordered several size",1,Dresses
Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!,0,Blouses
I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.,0,Blouses
Love it! can't wait for warmer weather to wear this sassy number!  i'm not sure what kind of bra to wear if any but it it fits so nicely around my bust line that it looks tasteful.,1,Lounge
Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it,1,Jackets
Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.,1,Skirts
"This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little ""shapeless"". however  the color is stunning  the quality is great  and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!",1,Dresses
So cozy and warm  great for the cold nights!,1,Sleep
This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything  so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly  without being too heavy.,1,Jackets
As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.,0,Jeans
I love denim and this tunic/dress/shirt is soft and fits really well except its almost too long to be a tunic/shirt but too short to be a dress - at least for me but i have a long torso - still not sure if i should keep it.,1,Dresses
These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes  even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!,1,Jeans
I bought this top in black  and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me  but this top is definitely a great length.,1,Blouses
Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.,0,Dresses
I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!,1,Skirts
"I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut ",0,Knits
This is such a cool top/sweater. i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that. great with skinnies and heels,1,Knits
I definitely like unique things  but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable  but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.,0,Knits
I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened  i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece,1,Lounge
"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back",0,Dresses
The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!,1,Blouses
Love this chinos.  they fit tts and the blue is vibrant.  bought them in pink too.  for reference i am 5&amp;amp;amp;#39;5&amp;amp;amp;quot; and weigh 122 lbs and bought size 27.  the fit is a bit slouchy much like in the photos.,1,Pants
This dress is as cute as i hoped it would be. i love the pockets and length and flattering cut. it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall. only con is that it is dry clean only. it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing  and i will probably go for it. i just don't have the patience or organization for dry cleaning.,1,Dresses
There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...,0,Knits
I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all  it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one.     the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i,0,Knits
"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",0,Shorts
"These are really cute. nice fabric. i love the rise...not to low  not too high. but they are going back. i'm a size 4. i got these in a 4. they fit fine in the waist and bum but they are tight around my calves. also  they were more like ""high waters"" on me than cropped so a petite in the length probably would have worked better for me had these fit.",1,Pants
I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price  it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top  absolutely!,1,Blouses
"It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5 4"" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.",0,Sweaters
"Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small  and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords  27 in some jeans. . i'm 5'2""  currently 25"" waist  33"" high hip  37.25"" at the widest  29"" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass  flatter stomach  bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great  which is why i risked paying shipping on these. . the 27 was loose at my natural waist  the jeans measuring 29.5""",1,Jeans
Very cute and comfortable!does run big  i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.,1,Sleep

Love this sweater. i have it in both colors. it's lightweight - a nice late summer/early fall option. the sleeves are really long which i love. because it's a loose knit  it will snag somewhat easily  so be a little careful,1,Fine gauge
"Despite retailer's claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat  beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th  feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed  because retailer indicated ""rest assured  this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle  i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di",0,Outerwear
I tried on the pink version  really nice  the fit is loose  but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall  very nice.     xs fit at 115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist,1,Knits
Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.,0,Blouses
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!,0,Knits
Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.,0,Knits
Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,0,Pants
I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big  but with a longish shirt it's fine. also  they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!,1,Lounge
This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.,1,Knits
This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,0,Knits
This is cute! i was hesitant to buy  but glad i did. it has a unique cut. the fit is tighter to the body  but it's very flattering. i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color. the blue seems more on the gray side to me  but it is mottled and really pretty. the neckline comes all the way up - as shown. the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool. i love it. pair it with a skirt or jeans. adorable!,1,Fine gauge
I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.,0,Sweaters
I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute  but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.,0,Knits
"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.",0,Jackets
Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater  did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus  it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(,0,Sweaters
This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.,0,Pants
I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.,0,Blouses
Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.,0,Dresses

Love the top design  not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.,0,Blouses
Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,0,Blouses
It looks great on the model but not on me. on me  it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.,0,Dresses
