I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half! it's going right back.,0,Dresses
I am normally a medium and i would take an xs in this top - i actually tried a m  s and xs and the xs fit but was still big. yes  this is supposed to be a loose draped piece  but for me  i didn't want it to make me look like i was huge through the waist line. the red is really pretty  the white is see thru.,1,Knits
"I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6"" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l",1,Knits
I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.,0,Sweaters
"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!",0,Jeans
I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose  yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available  too. i would definitely buy again!,1,Lounge
Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.,0,Blouses
I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,0,Fine gauge
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work  and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun  patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality  smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch  and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid",1,Pants
Ugh  i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt  its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i,0,Knits
It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.,0,Sweaters
Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.,0,Dresses
This is so beautiful! i loved it online  but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!,1,Intimates
I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun  nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!,1,Blouses
I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews)  then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured,1,Dresses
"I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently  i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants  and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side  but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however  if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6""  i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;) overall  this is a great addition to your wardrobe  and it washes nicel",1,Blouses
I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed,0,Dresses
I love this top  the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned  but might if i wore it to work,1,Blouses
As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,0,Intimates
I got the red  which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute  but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return  but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is),0,Knits
I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0,Pants
Great skirt  fits as expected. very cute  can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!,1,Skirts
What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h,0,Dresses

I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.,0,Sweaters
This sweater vest is versatile and adorable -- just runs very small. i normally wear an xs from retailer  and just exchanged for a medium. hoping that fits much better. i couldn't even get the xs on.,1,Sweaters
"After reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust  and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis  so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference  i'm 5'6""  a straight build 134 lbs  and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk",0,Dresses

Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person,0,Sweaters
I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,0,Jeans
This dress is lovely and the fabric is sensational.    the slits on the two sides of center front are really cool too.    i am 5'7 and it was way too long and i would not have it hemmed at it would remove the gorgeous  lotus pattern near the base of the skirt. i only wear flats at 70 but hope this fabric appears somewhere else  sometime. it is truly a gorgeous dress for a taller person.,1,Dresses
I carry my weight on my lower half  usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.,0,Legwear
I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.,0,Blouses

I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans  and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like  but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer  i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.,1,Knits

The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.,0,Fine gauge
Pros:  - fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.  - the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.  - love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.  - fabric has a great feel and stretch to it. forgiving fit.   - will go with many outfits.  -wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.  ______________  cons:  - does seem a tad delicate  easy to snag due to being a knit  but otherwise solid construction.  - unlined.  ______________________  rea,1,Knits

I love this coat. it's everything i've been looking for in a trench: navy blue  cut for dresses  with a vintage flair. and the medium fits like a glove (i'm a size 8). all that being said  be forewarned that this coat in unlined  so it won't be that warm a layer. the seams are covered in a bright turquoise bias tape so it doesn't seem especially unfinished. still worth the price on sale.,1,Outerwear
"I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.",0,Fine gauge

The fit  once you get it on is as flattering as can be. its beautiful quality is undeniable. the problem and it's a big one...you can't get it on without destroying your nails. the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone.

I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great.

I love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way  i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer. looks great with faded jeans. i love the poplin fabric  although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this won't hold up long enough to wear again next summer. for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better. i am narrow shoulder'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o,0,Blouses

I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge

This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some  the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores  but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.,1,Dresses
As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.,0,Jeans

I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.,0,Knits

I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit  because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami,1,Dresses

First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when,0,Fine gauge
This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4  the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame  though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it  it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust  waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover,1,Dresses

This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,0,Blouses

This top has a nice print and material.  being a full figure  it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy.  not very keen about the straps.  they're a bit longer for me  so they don't stay on my shoulders.  i'll keep it and adjust the straps.,1,Blouses

This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big  especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!,0,Dresses

This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe,0,Dresses

But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.,0,Knits
Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,0,Sweaters

Gosh  this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing  but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details  fit is comfortable yet elegant  nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath  but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).,1,Blouses

This dress is made of a wonderful  thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck,1,Dresses
"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy  thin  and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back  it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",0,Dresses

I agree with the previous review that this skirt definitely runs small. i am normally a size 4 with rooms but this size 4 was very tight. i decided not to go through the trouble of exchanging and to keep it. my boyfriend seems to like the style more than i do so that's a good thing :),1,Skirts
The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.,0,Knits
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,0,Dresses

The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,0,Jackets

I know this is supposed to be a loose  flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however  this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer  especially after seeing a few 5-stars.,0,Dresses
"I bought this in my usual size small  and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami  but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c  28-38  5'3"". it has an elegant  arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest  i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you.",1,Blouses

I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size)  but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me  but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still  a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.,1,Knits
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.,0,Dresses

Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.,0,Knits

Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white  but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large  but i needed an extra large  and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy  so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.,1,Knits

I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on  the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.,0,Skirts
I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area  it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).,1,Knits

I tried this dress on in the store  prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer  it would look more proportionate. next  the tie is really difficult to place  but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily  i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined  what a bummer  at least the skirt could be lined. but  it does have pockets  that is sweet.,0,Dresses
"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.",0,Pants

Great idea  but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked  but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success.

I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.,0,Sweaters

I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.,0,Fine gauge

I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.,0,Fine gauge

I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night  i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!,1,Knits
I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy!  glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.,1,Jackets
I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.,0,Dresses
Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,0,Layering

After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy  i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium. when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake. however when i tried it on it actually fit really well! i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way. very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews.,1,Knits
After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the,0,Dresses

I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.,1,Knits
This top is very pretty on the hanger. however  i have a curvy bust  and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy  too high of a neckline  unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely  and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.,0,Knits

I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey  even on sale)  but so far it's the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side  but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it's even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips  but it's pretty loose on top--y,1,Dresses

I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.,0,Sweaters
The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts
I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful  breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline  upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i,0,Dresses

Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats  and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured  so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!,1,Legwear
Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing i've ever seen!! i literally bought it as soon as a saw it. i got a size 2. i'm usually a 0 or 00 in most blouses and shirts  but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up. it's definitely not oversized even though i sized up. the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front - really flattering in my opinion. the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf!,1,Blouses
I can't decide on these pants. after trying them on in the store  they are very soft and a beautiful blue color. however  i found them a bit small. i usually take a l in retailer pants  and these are very tight. probably could pull them off with a tunic top  however  in spite of the fabric  the fit was just not comfortable for me. a good alternative for denim if you are slender  rather than curvy.,1,Pants
I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,0,Swim

Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel,0,Dresses

This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it,0,Blouses

The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri,0,Blouses

I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress,0,Dresses

Love the length  cut  & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences  though. minuses: easily wrinkled  grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy  bendy  they're designed to be more of an active short  so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase  i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is.

I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw,0,Dresses
The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo,0,Blouses

I tried this on in the store. all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes (and i love all of my local retailer stores!) i don't think these should be hung on a hanger. the knit is too heavy for hanging. the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor. i went home and ordered it online with the 20% dress discount and free shipping. the dress i received was clean  unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review,1,Dresses

I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top,0,Dresses

While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was,0,Jackets

Great looking casual dress  but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice  clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with,1,Dresses

I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it  and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.,1,Fine gauge

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.,0,Pants
"Such a lovely  well constructed top. looks great on petite frames. free flowing but not too ""peasant-like."" the embroidery is gorgeous. while it is pricey  it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece.",1,Lounge
Initially  i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.,0,Outerwear
This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!,1,Shorts
I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.,0,Knits
I love these pants. they are beautifully made and appear to be very comfortable. now if i could just get them buttoned! i am a size 8/medium. i bought the large after reading other reviews. i'm not joking when i say i can't button them. i am in such love with them (and still hoping to lose some baby weight)  that i am going to keep them in hopes to wear them!,1,Pants
I love this robe  it is my new favorite for lounging around the house,1,Sleep
The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.,0,Dresses
Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.,1,Knits
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.,0,Sweaters
My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!,0,Sweaters
"Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8""  135 lbs  an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.",0,Skirts
If you are over 25  this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it.,0,Blouses
