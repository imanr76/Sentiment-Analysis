So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,0,Legwear
"I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and i'm very pleased. they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms  the stripes remain a bit looser throughout. no complaints here! i like the variation. i ordered a size small as i'm normally a size small (36c  135 lbs  5'2"").",1,Blouses
I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area  it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).,1,Knits
I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.,0,Lounge
I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well.,0,Dresses
I liked these as soon as i saw them. the are very comfortable and the fit is great. well constructed and the material is soft but thicker.. easily worn into the cooler days. i am so happy i made this purchase!,1,Pants
I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect  the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however  the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.,0,Dresses
Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!,0,Sweaters
I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening  some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but didn't have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight  which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se,1,Outerwear
I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly  anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you,0,Sweaters
I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders  therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater,0,Sleep
"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",0,Jeans
Love these pants. i have several pairs of the pilcro scrip (and formerly super script). these do not have quite as much elastic as some cuts  but they still fit well and look great.,1,Jeans
It's super soft. it fits great. happy with the purchase.,1,Fine gauge
I ordered this in a regular medium even though i am short i never order petite pants as the crotch is always too short...but this crotch is very long.....i have exchanged for a medium petite and hopefully that will work. i have last years short denim romper by the same brand and did not run into this issue.,1,Pants
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to get the best quality and fitting dresses from retailer!,1,Dresses
"I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0"" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long  even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo.",0,Skirts
I love this tee. really comfortable and super cute too!,1,Knits
Not great quality  runs a bit lose  disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area),0,Knits
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",0,Jeans
This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,0,Knits
"I am in love with this dress. it's super soft  flattering  and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one.",1,Dresses
This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style  and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w,0,Knits
I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.,0,Dresses
I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.,0,Knits
This dress is so beautiful  the color is even more vibrant in person  a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm  which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top  look at the back view photo online  you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view  but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer,1,Dresses
So  ordered online. tried this on  boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.   back it goes. super cute but huge.,0,Knits
This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn't get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this,1,Jackets
"This is a cute top that is very soft and comes in nice colors. it's body hugging  but not clingy. i'm 5'5"" 120 with square shoulders and a longer torso  and when i initially tried a small i thought it looked ok  but when i tried on the extra small it looked much better. the way the top is cut it fits a bit weird under the arms  as you can see in the photos  but it wasn't enough to keep me from picking up a few colors when it went on sale. i like wearing this under a jacket or cardigan with jeans",0,Knits
I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.,0,Skirts
These were very nice  but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist ,0,Jeans
Cute white t-shirt different style but didn't work on my body type so i returned it    good price point    basic fabric,1,Knits
I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.,0,Blouses
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,0,Knits
Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear  not fussy  no special bra needed.,1,Blouses
I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.,0,Blouses
I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde,0,Swim
Form fitting  hugs in the right spots  and love the pattern. it's a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however  an excellent evening dress.,1,Dresses
I thought this would look great with skirts  but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops  but for this one i bought a medium  and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but  as i mentioned  it doesn't go with any of my skirts  so it's not worth looking for a small.,0,Knits
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,0,Fine gauge
This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation  but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that  like many byron lars sheath dresses  the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t,1,Dresses
I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on  but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so  if you have wide hips  this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l  it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.,0,Dresses
"Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute.",0,Pants
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy,0,Dresses
This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans  and they were worth every penny. i love the fit  the distressing  everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing  which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also  i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle  which is perfect.,1,Jeans
"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b  150 5' 9""  tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.",0,Dresses
I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured  i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.  i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer.   this jacket runs smaller  the sleeves were very tight   and overall it was just too small. had to return it.,1,Jackets
I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow  not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy  though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to,1,Dresses
So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year  i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom,1,Shorts
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer  and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly  but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money  i could get it tailored  but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!,0,Dresses
This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!,0,Dresses
The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.,1,Sweaters
Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.,0,Blouses
I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.,1,Blouses
I love the design of this top - short and swingy  with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes  definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes  so you can kind of see your bra from the side.,1,Knits
This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders  but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side  but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting,1,Knits
I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.,0,Blouses
I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.,0,Dresses

Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.,1,Legwear
Love love  love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this  because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.,1,Sweaters
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.,0,Knits
I love so much about it... it really is a gorgeous piece!  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve... there's something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small  or shrunk it in the dryer =0  i'm the only one commenting on that  so it must be me. lol. i think i'm going to begrudgingly return this one :(,0,Sweaters
This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique  flowing  romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like  fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!,1,Blouses
I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,1,Blouses
I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.,0,Blouses
I bought this top to wear this fall  and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder  making this great for work.,1,Knits
I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.,0,Dresses
Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist  but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).     it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.,1,Jackets
Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.,1,Sweaters
I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.,0,Knits
This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem,1,Sweaters
The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.,0,Sweaters
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.,0,Sweaters
The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering  particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable  and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys  it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).,1,Swim
I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier  so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in  so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.,1,Knits
I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality,0,Fine gauge
I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass - they didn't look cute and i thought they wouldn't be cute on  because the little pockets looked droopy --but i was so wrong! once they went on sale  i took a chance b.c. i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip. ordered a size small and it fits perfect - so cute  i just love it! glad i bought it at the sale price because now i'm even happier!,1,Fine gauge
Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body,1,Knits
I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan  and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.,1,Dresses
"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable  with gorgeous embroidered detailing  but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio  i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist  the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened.",0,Pants
I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green  but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms  even across my chest  and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so  while beautiful and so incredibly soft  it has to go back. (if you have slender arms  i think it would be a great fit.),1,Blouses
I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.,0,Knits
I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible  unflattering  and laughable! please try again with this one  retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!,0,Knits
So pretty & comfortable! love it!,1,Lounge
This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.,0,Jackets
I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer  i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting  but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless  long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater  trimmer  more cut. the ruc,0,Dresses
"I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats. this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer 33-34"" inseam. this style is a bit shorter- however  with the lighter fabric  i wouldn't want it touching the ground. pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf. call me old fashioned  but all pants should be lined! the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist.",1,Pants
I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable  elegant and very chic.     i will make this my go-to dress from now on.,1,Dresses
The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality  tight knit  overall good purchase. however  it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes. i will keep it because it's gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit  but it doesn't look on me like it does on the model.,1,Fine gauge
I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.,0,Dresses
Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.,0,Sweaters
This is a stunning blouse! you can't tell from the photo  but it looks very 1930-1940's. i am so happy with this blouse  it is gorgeous. i'm an xl  and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully. it fits nice and flowy and i feel i don't need a cam underneath. i highly recommend it!,1,Blouses
This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit  but not as a layering piece.,0,Blouses
I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place  the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places  and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!,1,Dresses
I love this dress so very much! i wish i could keep it  but it doesn't look right on me. i am 5'2  100lbs  32b  24 waist  33 hip. dress fit me well except for the fact that it made me look very wide. i think the combination of the ruffles on the sleeves with the blousey-ness and my short stature was not a great combo. it will be amazing on tall slender women  but did not flatter my short frame :(   otherwise beautiful,1,Dresses
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.",0,Dresses

This is such a cute top with so much potential  soft fabric  vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top  regrettably  has to go back.  i love swing tops but retailer  could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??,0,Knits

This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.,0,Blouses
I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces).     unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the,1,Knits

The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.,0,Lounge
This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.,0,Dresses

I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.,0,Sweaters
This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual.

I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.  i don't usually go for peplum  but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on  everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.,1,Knits
I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.,0,Blouses
The color  design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large.   bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s,0,Knits

But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.,0,Knits
Well  it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too  and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev,1,Fine gauge

I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.,0,Pants

These are very well-made jeans  the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist  and they make my butt look great. however  these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing  but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy  then buy your regular size.,0,Jeans
Unique vest: modern  chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes  and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality  like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.,1,Jackets

Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,0,Skirts

So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,0,Jeans
I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.,1,Intimates
Super soft  super cute but too short for a dress  too long and too overwhelming for a shirt  and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors  feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.,0,Dresses
Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material  fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller  thinner bods.,0,Knits
I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,0,Fine gauge
I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,0,Intimates

I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.,0,Pants

The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s,0,Blouses

I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.,0,Dresses
Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.,0,Dresses

I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur,0,Knits
I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,0,Knits

Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd  so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.    the fabric is sheer but not overly so  embroidery is well done. over all a b,1,Blouses
I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0,Pants

Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway  i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.,0,Knits

I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color,1,Jeans

I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,0,Dresses

Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.,0,Dresses
Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow  is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!,1,Sweaters

I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.,0,Knits

This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in,0,Sweaters

This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist,0,Dresses

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother ,0,Knits
Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso  and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that  the material is a very good qu,0,Dresses
Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,0,Shorts
Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas  so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect  since the colors aren't look too summery  but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy  but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops  this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.,1,Blouses

Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,0,Dresses

I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses
At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,0,Jackets

Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg  have plenty of length (i'm 5'6  and there is a good inch of extra length)  but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though  but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey  probably a size 31 in jeans right now  and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality,1,Lounge
These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4)  they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off  these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!,0,Pants

I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not,0,Fine gauge
I love the design of this shirt - very flattering fit. very soft and great as a layering piece.,1,Knits
For me  this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.,0,Dresses
I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.,1,Dresses
I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning,0,Blouses
"Tried the blue motif  size 6  regular.  i'm 5'6"" and if i were shorter i'd go with petite sizing.  stats: 34a-28-36 with broad shoulders  sometimes i go up to a size 8 in blazers but this was a perfect fit. side pockets  dress is unlined and quite lightweight. the tie has to be tied in back and i liked the clean lines this gives in front. nice and simple for when it warms up!",1,Dresses
"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7""  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it.",0,Pants
The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also  i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27  but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.,0,Trend
I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.,0,Dresses
This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.,0,Dresses
"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately  there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.",0,Dresses
"The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",0,Fine gauge
"Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the ""boho peasant"" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected)   she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off. disappointing as picture makes it much prettier.",0,Blouses
I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.,0,Knits
This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,0,Jackets
The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.,1,Dresses
An excellent going out to dinner  to a lounge  etc. piece. super flattering  sexy  feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits  but this was excellent!,1,Pants
I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now  so i can't even reorder. bummer.,0,Dresses
I love this shirt  very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest  so i returned for the next size up.  very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.,1,Blouses
Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans  shorts  a bathing suit  take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash  air dry.,1,Knits
Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,0,Shorts
"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals  one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly  a looser jacket sti",1,Lounge
The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.,0,Skirts

I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a,0,Pants
The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a,1,Skirts

"I was so excited bout this top. it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person. the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline. i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips. it def. does not have the length as described or measured in the description. i""m 5'5"" and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body. if you have tiny h",0,Knits
"Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2"" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual.",0,Pants
A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,0,Fine gauge
