"I love this denim jacket! it's just a basic light denim jacket with a casual  pre-worn  soft feel. i like how it's slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size  possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6 "" 125 lbs.  and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model  i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!",1,Jackets
"I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend  who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft  and the color is great.",1,Dresses
"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace  substantial fabric  great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders  and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model  they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned  the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4""  120 lbs  and tried a size s.",0,Blouses
I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning  but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium  so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.,0,Dresses
I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however  the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(,0,Blouses
"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely  distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist  but i could layer it nicely. i am 5'4""  130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",1,Fine gauge
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",0,Dresses
Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,0,Fine gauge
I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now  so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful  but there is no lining  leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d,0,Pants
Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun  not too flashy. a very warm hue  it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material  very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made  with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress  and the small fit beautifully  even with my large top. it is a stunner  that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments,1,Dresses
I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't,0,Dresses

"Beautiful colors  especially the pink. i am 5'3"" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise  which i don't really mind  but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric.",1,Dresses
This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.,0,Fine gauge
This wears nicely  and is true to photo. flattering in the waist  and on a petite  everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially  there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone.,0,Dresses
First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when,0,Fine gauge

This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style  and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w,0,Knits
"I have been in love with white lace tops lately. i saw in the description that there was a ""polyester lining"" - i'm really not into wearing a cami all the time as it takes away from the lace (my personal opinion). so i'm a little disappointed there there is no lining. very pretty. styling is a bit more ""swing"".",1,Knits

Great jeans by pilcro  too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.,0,Jeans
At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.,0,Knits
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.,0,Knits
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,0,Dresses

I've been looking for a great long  loose  versatile vest for some time  and this is just about perfect. it's slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate)  but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger  and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!,1,Sweaters
Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops  and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however  i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me  but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't,1,Blouses
I love everything about this dress  but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area  making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming  the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like  which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re,1,Dresses

When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however  when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.,1,Sweaters
This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape  comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s  and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more  although that will make it easier to wear during the,1,Trend
I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured  except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower.,1,Dresses

I have been needing a perfect go-to white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations. it's the perfect weight for year-round use  love that it's 3/4 sleeves (again great for year round)  and the slight front v adds a nice special touch. fell in love with the first one i bought online  so ordered a second for backup. it's a winner (and great price)!,1,Knits
I love  love  love this brand. these people know how to cut and construct a dress. i'm apple-shaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me  but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws. the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great. the fabric is high-quality and fully-lined. it's perfect for work or for going out. i love that it's black and bronze-y  because i can wear it with black or brown accessories. i'm generally between a l/xl in retailer and the l fits wel,1,Dresses
Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.,1,Knits
I bought this shirt for my 16 year old daughter. it looked adorable on her! she loved it and can't wait to wear it. the fabric felt like a great quality and the color was quite unique.,1,Knits
I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple. i like classic things with a twist  and this fits the bill. it is nice quality  and the colors are vivid. it is slightly tight in the bust line for me  but it is not retailer's fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress. i'll deal with it. otherwise  the dress is nice quality  and will come in handy throughout summer. the price is right  so grab it!!,1,Dresses
Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might  it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second  the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one  but the center of the blouse was so offset  that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an,0,Knits
This is a truly beautiful dress  and yes  so much better in person.  upon examining the dress  however  i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places  there were some frayed ends  and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250  and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so  it will be a keeper!,0,Dresses
I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom  but whoa... even when sizing up  i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable  and if you have a smaller bust  it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.,0,Dresses
"I was so excited bout this top. it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person. the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline. i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips. it def. does not have the length as described or measured in the description. i""m 5'5"" and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body. if you have tiny h",0,Knits

I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived  the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me  it is going back.,0,Sweaters
Just purchased this skirt. it is absolutely the most comfortable skirt for every season......every color imaginable will go with this skirt. great with denim shirt too. lightweight cotton knit makes the skirt comfy with any temperature. waistband is wide and slimming to the tummy. i stand 5 foot 10 inches  174 lbs and it is perfect in length. platform or flats  dress up or down. my favorite is a v neck tee with a couple necklaces and your good to go......,1,Skirts
Like the other reviewer said  there's a nice inner lining  and the material of the jacket is just so nice. looks a little like a blazer when worn  but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece.,1,Lounge
I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,0,Knits

If i hadn't seen the description online  i would never have known these pants were navy!   i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.  since i'm heavy around the stomach  i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid,1,Pants

This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference  i'm 5'2  120 lbs.,1,Dresses
I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit  but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!,1,Layering

I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.,0,Knits
I ordered the red color way  and the bird print is very cute. that said  it is cut a-line and not like a regular button down. through i found it tts and good quality  it was shorter than i would have liked. this exaggerated the a-line shape. i didn't completely dislike it  but i didn't love it either.,0,Blouses

Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way  i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.,1,Blouses
I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.,0,Pants
After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,0,Jackets
Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses

I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs  2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down  even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings.,0,Dresses

I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.  the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin  as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area,0,Fine gauge

I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy.   it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material  therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater.,1,Dresses

The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line  trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly  you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front  which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such. the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure,1,Blouses

Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it  and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great  drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape  but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.,1,Jackets

I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.,0,Knits
Buy these  they are a keeper. sturdy fabric  not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy  soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors  hoping that black will be available.,1,Pants

Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,0,Knits
The blue has three colors of stripes: blue  white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model  not tight but form fitting.,0,Knits

I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however  i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.,0,Knits
I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice  thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom  just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end  which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs  and the xs was not even,0,Knits

This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.,0,Knits

I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,0,Jeans
This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up  it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached  the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer  soft and smooth  and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking  from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t,1,Dresses
I bought this sweater because i love twinkle's knitting patterns and yarns. this sweater doesn't disappoint. i love all of the great details like the detachable collar  the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch (which differs from the front and sleeve stitch). it's super warm and cozy but it's also very heavy. depending on the temp outside  i can wear this as a coat. but i think the sweater will stretch over time because it's so heavy.,1,Sweaters
I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high  and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy  too stretchy  too scratchy  too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews  and as soon as i tried it on  i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable  and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i,1,Dresses
I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.,0,Dresses
This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,0,Intimates

Love the design of the t-shirt but the quality is poor in my opinion. i got the white t-shirt and the material is so fragile i can see it tearing or being prone to rips after only a few wears. for the price i thought the quality is not up to par. the white t-shirt is see through but with a nude camisole underneath it is fine.,0,Knits

When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust  and the peplum just made me look like i didn't have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top  but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures.,1,Knits

Good weight and texture to the dress but looked to tent-like for me. even taking it out of the package my first thought was  is this size mislabeled? i got a 0 but could probably have done better with 00 if those were in stock or if petite sizes were still available. returning but wish i could keep it,1,Dresses
I was really eager to receive this sweater  i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new  it is mostly shapeless  it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col,0,Sweaters

Reviewers may be right that this skirt runs large but it fit well on my waist. it does not come in petite so petite buyers should be aware that it will be more of a midi than a knee-length skirt. it is adorable. i love it especially for its whimsical design of birds  and the colors are deep and lovely with the red popping out more than it does in the picture.the fabric is heavy but there is a slight give to it  which helps with the waist. it's a keeper.,1,Skirts

The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.,0,Lounge

I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress  i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!,1,Dresses

This sweater is beautiful and well made  but i found the cut strange and unflattering. i ordered it in my usual size small  and it was too big in the shoulders and arms  with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms. but it just fit me in the chest  and would be too tight if i sized down. this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual.,0,Sweaters

One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said  best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high  but it was worth it!,1,Dresses

In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th,0,Dresses

This dress is elegant and really lovely. it looks like a throwback to the 20s and 30s. it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types. and this is why i am recommending it. but be warned: it runs large.  the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at all--it is completely sheer. for example  i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric  which is not the look i'm going for. this might be a deal breaker for some. for me  i,0,Dresses

This top is very pretty on the hanger. however  i have a curvy bust  and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy  too high of a neckline  unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely  and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.,0,Knits
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,0,Swim

First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,0,Fine gauge

Because of how much i have been buying recently  i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round  dress it up or down  and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious.

I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline  so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale  but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather  though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n,1,Dresses

I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips  one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.,0,Dresses
