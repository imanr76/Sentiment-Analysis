I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles)  the length is perfect  the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all  unlike another reviewer) the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look  which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide  swingy style  but with the sl,0,Sweaters
I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.,0,Pants
Love this dress  i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.  great unique dress!,1,Dresses
I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small  but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large  so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.,1,Blouses
I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value. it was returned.,0,Knits
I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture  and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous  and the top feels high quality. that said  as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust  and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle   which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted  so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always,1,Blouses
A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.,0,Fine gauge
"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.",0,Dresses
"Vibrant  lovely and quite long! this maxi works for leggy bettys - i stand 5'11"" in my stocking feet  and the dress hem grazed the floor. not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests  but stunning nonetheless. runs a bit small. i normally wear xs to s  and i tried a xs in-store  but it fit just ever-so-slightly too snug. i didn't try a size s  but i suspect it may have fit ever-so-slightly too large.",1,Dresses
Usually wear a small  sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small  if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws  so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great  medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.,1,Knits
Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.,0,Dresses
I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall  i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...,0,Blouses
This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower  close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute  long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual,1,Knits
This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,0,Pants
Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn't as real  almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why  pilcro?? the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the,0,Shorts
I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .,1,Knits

I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars  yes  this top is for a strapless bra  my bra top (where the strap starts  0 was showing  but so nice... shape was ok for me  it does go in at the hem  givinng a bubble-like shape  but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps  but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store  but checked  and yes  that's true... love it.    not an online exclusive  as it was in my store  i pur,1,Blouses

Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium  but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.,1,Knits
This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty.  love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move.  very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.,1,Dresses

"I bought this dress online after a long search for the perfect dress to wear to my daughter's fall wedding. i did not want something full length or too formal. after modeling several dresses for my boys this one got the thumbs up. i do love the design and that it is different enough from all the other mother-of-bride dresses out there. i will wear this with black nylons and wedges (since this wedding is in a meadow). i'm completely satisfied! for reference i am 45 years old  5'10""  160 lbs with",1,Dresses
I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,0,Dresses
I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms  i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me  this was a no go :(,0,Lounge
This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.,0,Knits
When i saw this tunic dress  i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable  true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.,1,Lounge
Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!,0,Dresses
Yes  this is a beautiful print and fits perfectly...but it's unlined thin polyester. full price is pretty ludicrous on this one. tts  but might need to size up if you have a larger chest (no stretch). hoping to grab on sale.,1,Dresses

Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.,0,Sweaters

I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go,0,Blouses
This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,0,Intimates
Thus sweater is perfect. the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews. it is super soft and not at all itchy. i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress. the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus. i haven't dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink. i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price.,1,Sweaters

This is a beautiful looking dress  but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4  112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked  even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress  and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.,0,Dresses

I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately  i was very disappointed when i received it. it is  as a previous person said  very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy  and in my opinion  did not flatter my shape at all. sadly  i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic  or straight and slender  as you suggest.,0,Knits

This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,0,Swim
I'm usually a 12  or size l in retailer and when i tried this on  buttoning it up from the bottom  i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined  which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy  and a good length - many trenches are too short  or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i,0,Outerwear

I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.,0,Pants

On the hanger i thought this would be a great work dress  but on my curves it was pretty scandalous. really low cut--will need to pin it  and hugs curves (if you have them). it's comfortable and i like the pattern. i have a number of maeve's jersey dresses so i'm not expecting it to last incredibly long  but at 25% off it was a good deal.,1,Dresses

This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,0,Jackets

I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!,0,Knits

"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum",1,Pants
I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite  sadly when it arrived and i tried it on  it was very boxy  stiff like  and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.,0,Sweaters
"When i saw this  i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well)  but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere  including the arms. the length was at my knees  and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly  it's going",0,Sweaters
Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material  i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!,1,Dresses
Love this. the stripes are cute and simple  but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank  so there is a lot of fabric  but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :),1,Knits

This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on,0,Dresses

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend
"The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me  i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6"").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem  it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall",1,Skirts

Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.,0,Knits

This pullover is a beautiful deep blue color with a unique  relaxed design. when i first bought it  i found a snag on it and had to exchange it. the new pullover didn't have any snags  but did have a hole along the seam. i really like the pullover's relaxed fit and unique design  but the fabric doesn't seem very durable and is prone to snagging. time will tell how well the fabric holds up.,1,Fine gauge

I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.,0,Dresses
The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.,0,Blouses

I loved the look and feel of this tunic. the fabric is soft. it has pockets!!! i felt like it ran a little small in the bust. i'm a 34d and rather than my usual size medium i took a large in this. i took off one star because when it was shipped to me the shoulder was coming apart. i will have a tailor fix it because i do plan to keep it.,1,Blouses

Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.,0,Jeans
I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.,0,Blouses
"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.",0,Dresses
My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.,0,Jeans

This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person  i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now  spring  and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10  so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!,1,Blouses

I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,0,Blouses

I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large  however the arm/shoulder area is tight.,0,Dresses
If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.,0,Dresses
Delayed for a month on back order  this dress was worth the wait!  the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures.  the length and cut is slimming  more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist.  detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees.  pullover style with a closed-end side zip that's needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all.        if your skin is sensitive--this dress isn't for you.  both the line,1,Dresses

Beautiful in white  and beautiful to look at  but as the other reviewer mentioned  the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however  the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition  some of the beading is already coming off  and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad  but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful,1,Blouses

I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece  and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops  the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo  for instance. it is definitely not slimming  but the striking patt,0,Sweaters

This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering  a bit special  all in all nice. but the white is see through  and the green somehow reads much more casual  at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.,1,Blouses

"I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s",0,Dresses

I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much  but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas  it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.,1,Blouses
Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse  but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture  and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion  but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun  cute detail  and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.,1,Blouses

I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length  which does not work with my mama belly.,0,Knits
It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede,0,Dresses

I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material  yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7  130 pounds  athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.,1,Jeans
I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest  but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape  it'd be worth it  but it's going back.,0,Dresses

I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top,0,Dresses

I find myself gravitating towards comfortable items currently. this one caught my eye because of its length (tunic) and because  unlike many of the items right now  it actually appeared fitted. only after that did i notice the pretty detail on the sleeves.the price point is too high for a casual item such as this  but the sleeves do make up for it. the cut is really great for my straight and slender body type. perfect! a great weight for those in-between temperatures that we'll be feeling as we,1,Knits
This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.,0,Dresses

The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.,0,Dresses

I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.,0,Knits

This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,0,Dresses

Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants
I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very  very rarely a size 0  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose  flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however  the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.    i do really like the styling and quality  so i am planning on,0,Blouses

This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.,0,Knits

Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.,0,Blouses

Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight  it's back  and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made  can go from business to sport to casual.,1,Jackets
I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,0,Shorts

This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,0,Dresses

I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out  not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it  i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short  it fits well.,1,Shorts

I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut  but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole,0,Dresses

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.,0,Dresses
The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.,0,Knits

I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother ,0,Knits

Retailer does it again! i'm constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out  and this skirt is perfect! you can't really tell in the pictures  but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black  which makes the skirt have more of a statement. it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter!,1,Skirts

I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.,0,Knits
When i tried it on  it was a bit shapeless  but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag  always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam  and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.,0,Dresses
I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa,0,Blouses

The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.,0,Knits
I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.,1,Dresses

I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.,0,Blouses
I normally take a small or medium in antrho tops  i ordered the xs/s and i'm kind of swimming in it. i think it's a good look though  and will complement shorts or skinny jeans. i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it! i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isn't the case at all. the sweater is all soft and flowy  drapes nicely  and can be easily dressed up or down. worth the price.,1,Sweaters

Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,0,Pants
I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!,0,Knits

I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out,0,Dresses

"This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream  but wow is it short! i'm 5'8"" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse.     because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt  i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies  but tall & curvy ladies beware.",0,Knits
I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo,0,Knits
I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me  it's not a flattering cut.,0,Knits

This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however  i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide  better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.  i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled! sadly returning.,1,Knits
