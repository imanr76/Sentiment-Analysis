I ordered a small  but it was way to big. it was very soft.,0,Jackets
Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,0,Blouses
Great layering top. so comfy  feels soft as my pjs. bought it in 3 colors.,1,Layering
"I just received this shirt in the mail  and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say  ""hurry and get yours before they're gone "" but in truth  i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)",1,Knits
The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however  the armhole is way too low  which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low  most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!,0,Dresses
I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation  and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.    retailer has continually helped me present polished & professional  yet still show my personal style & inclusive nature.    it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has,1,Dresses
I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres,0,Dresses
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe",0,Dresses

I love this vest. i think it is heavy for a warm spring/summer day so kind've surprised it was featured at the store early spring. i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium. i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect. size 34 dd  145 lbs and 5 ft 4 in height. it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire. this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time. beautiful quality.,1,Sweaters
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms  all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra",0,Blouses
This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.,0,Dresses
This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy.,1,Sweaters
So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money  but i needed something to wear that was transitional.,0,Dresses
The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts
This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously,1,Blouses
The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t,0,Fine gauge
I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it  it looked exactly as it does in the picture online  however  the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms  which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt  but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.,0,Knits
Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00  and  oddly enough  there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy  or is the 00 size just a sham?,0,Blouses
This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however  the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin  you probably need to size down.,1,Knits
This sweater is beautiful and stylish  but unfortunately it sheds a bit. considering the sale price  it's still worth it so i won't return it.,1,Sweaters
I love it but i don't at the same time:    sheer  so sheer  you can probably get away with a nude bra  but not sure... i tried on both colors  and love them both. love the shimmer... i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regular...i think i would go with regular  the petite seemed cropped on me  so if i lift my arms  hello belly...    so overall  i would probably get this if it goes on sale  color is either way  but since i don't have an immediate need  i passed. nice turtleneck  though.    reference: 11,1,Fine gauge
So many things to love about this top. if you're a fan of peplum tops - which i most definitely am - this is a great one. slightly shorter in front than in back. nice flare  but doesn't stick out too far. and overall  i thought it was well-made. i tried on the red in stores  and it looks a lot like the color in the photo. however  i'm a 36dd  and unfortunately  the top was just not large enough. totally squashed the girls  and there's basically no give in the fabric. i'm normally a 10/12  and ot,1,Blouses
This is such a cute top with so much potential  soft fabric  vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top  regrettably  has to go back.  i love swing tops but retailer  could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??,0,Knits

I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th,0,Fine gauge
Beautiful and chic. so glad i tried it on!,1,Knits
I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.,0,Blouses
Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.,0,Knits

As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah  that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size  and again in a larger size. unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties.,0,Pants
Intrepid soul that i am  i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle  then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes  shook it out  hung it up  and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes  the swing is vast  but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun  something i will use for years  wonderfully comfort,1,Blouses
I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this,0,Knits
Based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however  the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.  they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo,0,Pants
I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.,0,Jeans
I really like this jacket! it runs big  so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting  but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!,1,Jackets
Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!,0,Dresses
I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap,0,Dresses
Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!,1,Dresses
I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.,0,Jeans
I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.,0,Jeans
Love this dress! it is very flattering and makes my waist look tiny. i don't care for the hem. it isn't terrible  but i wish it was cut straight across instead of curved at the bottom. i'll probably have it altered. comfortable  great for the office.,1,Dresses
I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.,0,Pants

"I have the blue and holly joggers. i absolutely love the fit   feel and color of the joggers. the oddity is that the elastic at the waist bunches in the blue pair but not the holly. it drives me crazy. i could only wear the blue for a couple of hours before i had to change into something else (unfortunately the holly joggers were in the wash).  i'm going to take the blue joggers to the seamstress. maybe she can fix them. 65""  135  small was perfect.",1,Pants
I adore this blouse  but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.,0,Blouses
What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem  it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.,0,Knits

Overall: soft material  cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right.     fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a  than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad,0,Swim

This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,0,Dresses

I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked,0,Fine gauge

I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi,0,Fine gauge

Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight  i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely  so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.,0,Lounge
So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.,1,Trend
I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.,0,Dresses

Well  it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too  and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev,1,Fine gauge

First off - i love these jeans... they are the exact look i have been searching for  and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair. the only problem - which i found with a previous purchase - is that they hit me at the ankle  rather than what is pictured. since i liked everything about these jeans  i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter. this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching... the stitching blends,1,Jeans

I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding  so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence  and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist  but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir,1,Blouses
I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice,0,Dresses

I loved the idea of this dress  but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting  but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft  but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.,0,Dresses

I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.,1,Knits

I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.,1,Blouses
Found this lovely dress in store and wanted to try it on. fits true to size everywhere except the bust. i am a size 2-4 with a 34dd bust. i can normally fit most retailer dresses no problem though. this one was very very very tight just in the bust and squished my chest to be a very unflattering shape.    i am 5'4 and the length was perfect just above the knee  for a youthful but work appropriate length.  i am a relatively fit but hourglass curvy lady  but certainly not a 'perfect' beach body and,1,Dresses

Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,0,Jackets

This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer  but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt  or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey  which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!,1,Dresses

This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.  the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold  gentle  cycle and they were stained/     i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.,0,Pants
I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing  but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.,1,Dresses
"I had this in my wish list a long time  ten when sale came along  my size was sold out. however  someone returned it at my local store. i purchased it then tried it on later... why i ended returning it:    fabric was gorgeous  and light  but fall is coming  and i won't wear it until next summer. may get over it by then  the shape is really nice  but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs  as others mentioned  there are spots where the sewing is not ""perfect"" and bulges a little",1,Dresses
Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen)  but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall  and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!,1,Knits

This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit  large if not). very cute too!,1,Blouses
I am 6ft tall and wear a size 12 bottom. i ordered these in a large because i wanted the length to be as long as possible and they were perfect.   i have a 36 in inseam and these pants drug on the floor.   i could even wear my wedges with them and they were still beautifully long and drapey.  i bought the silver color and it was definitely more of a khaki.  i probably could have easily worn a medium  as i did have to pull them up when i walked throughout the day.  this may be because of the stre,1,Pants

You've probably read through the other reviews  so i'll try not to repeat too much: __________ pros: - it is lightweight and flows beautifully  flattering every sort of shape and frame. - the leather circles throughout are darling and seem to be fairly secure (some of mine were a bit bent upon receipt). - the color is subtle yet not understated. it just works. not sheer  lining throughout that isn't itchy and some tulle on top of the lining to give it a bounce and fuller shape. - color is more t,1,Skirts

I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways  i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue  and their material is fabulous  but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted  but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style  as i'm short  with a short waist. this,0,Knits
Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.,0,Dresses
I thought this was a fun piece to have  but didn't realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes  or dressing it up with fancier accessories. i love this jumpsuit! it is well made  and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy,1,Pants
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0,Sleep
This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that i've long wanted to fill: that of the perfect springtime dress. i got the sky blue color in a size 4 (for reference  i am 120 lbs and 34-26-37) and it fits like a glove. the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic. i'll be wearing it with casual cognac sandals  a floppy straw hat  and minimal makeup.,1,Dresses

I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine  but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but  i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me  still fitted at the waist (27inches)  but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.,1,Jackets

This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck  depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise  this is one of my favorite tanks  and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it.     this tank has some stretch  so i imagine it fits a range of siz,1,Intimates
I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well  but once i wash it  it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small  but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust  and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me  size up.,1,Knits

This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom  is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight  which is what attracted me to it  but when i put it on  i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i,0,Dresses

This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely  the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i,1,Knits

Haha  the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline  i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which  with my full bust underneath it  refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.,1,Fine gauge
Just bought this today and i love it. so simple  and at the same time it's not. the fabric makes it casual to dress up or down  but the shape of it is incredible and what takes it above simple. the straps felt a little long  so i will likely get it altered to be shortened in the straps. got the red and it's gorgeous.,1,Dresses

I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.,0,Pants
This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall  a deep vivid blue color  and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway  but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price  it just wasn't right for me.,1,Trend
I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them  i didn't love them. i love some stretch  so that part was good. however  the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.       i really want to love them  though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect  which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway  they do have a cute shape  bu,0,Jeans
I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't  the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.,0,Knits
Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.,1,Sweaters
I ordered this dress in a 12 which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs  small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long  to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking  i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back.,1,Dresses
As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.,0,Dresses

I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,0,Dresses

I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,0,Jeans

This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color  not close to red  but it will work well with black  gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.,1,Fine gauge
Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses

So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti,0,Lounge
I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace  in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami  which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it  my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made ,1,Blouses

This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se,0,Dresses
I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i,0,Dresses
